10,Counter-Strike,It's a old game but is good.
1002,Rag Doll Kung Fu,One of a kind game. Local multiplayer with multiple mice is more fun than it has any right to be.
100400,Silo 2,"I've not used this very much as I have been using MODO indie but for sub d modelling this is crazy to get a great high poly for a bake.  Awesome user interface for ease of use, when you combine this with the shortcut keys you can work extremely fast. I only really use this for high poly sub d modelling and it works flawlessly, you can work so quick and it feels so fluid almost like you are drawing on paper!"
10090,Call of Duty: World at War,great game my onley problem is that my campain and zombies wont open up please tell me how to fix it :)
10100,King's Quest Collection,"King's Quest 5 is the first point-and-click adventure game I ever played way back in the far off time called the 1990's and I was immediately in love with the genre. I might just be a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but the games seem boring and look like total ♥♥♥♥ that make my eyes hurt. I know there are fan-made re-makes of some of these games with updated visuals. Try those if you're really curious about these games, but otherwise just stick with newer games if you're a fan of the genre. These games are also from the era when Sierra made games that if you didn't get a certain item and left the area, the game would be unwinnable as you couldn't go back to get that item you need to keep progressing. And this was all done so you'd have to call their pay hint line when you got completely stuck and didn't realize you had no way of figuring out the unsolvable puzzle. No wonder they went out of business. Those ♥♥♥♥♥uckers."
10110,Space Quest Collection,"I love Space Quest. Almost everything you see, do, or hear is hilarious! Clever puns, jokes, and satire abound. Especially play Space Quest IV and 6, both featuring the late, great Tony Jay."
10120,Aces of the Galaxy,"If you like rail arcade shooters, this is the game for you."
10130,TimeShift,"At the time of this writing, Timeshift feels a bit old, not because of the graphics but mostly the storyline. This does not make the game bad, but definitely the plot is one of the weaknesses.  The concept of manipulating time is very clever and I have not found it in any other game to date. It is a slolid FPS with a respectable graphic quality, even for our current generation.  The game itself is short and the learning fast and difficult spike is not high. I finished it and my only regret was the very shallow storyline. Still, Sierra did a very good job, IMHO as this game is worth a 8/10, specially for its innovative syste and thus it is recommended for the casual player of FPS, like me.  Thanks Sierra for this good game!"
10140,3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures Deluxe,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
10150,Prototype,What a nice game! Family Friendly! I really liked how you cut the ketchup people and their ketchup flies everywhere! The 'cursing' was just words like darn and wow! Reccommended for all!
10180,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,better than the new cods but full of hackers as activion gave up on it after releasing the new crap.
10220,Postal 3,"Once apon a time, I write a review for this game before encountering all the incompleteness. if you get it, only get it once it is on sale. game is incomplete and you should get patches and improvements and Beta Mod Pack 1.1 before you play. end."
102200,Runespell: Overture,Really liked this game. I'm a big sucker for card games and have wasted X amout of time on Windows Solitaire so this was a given. If you don't like poker or fantasy you shouldn't bother though.
10230,Dead Mountaineer's Hotel,"i recommend that you dont buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game , i cant even get guy to move from spot i started game at . and i hit every key possible hehe "
10240,Stroke of Fate: Operation Valkyrie,"Honestly, biggest fluke of a game I've bought in the past half a year. I cannot say it's a bad game, because I cannot even play it long enough to have an opinion.  Here is what I encountered throughout my c.a. 3 hours of gameplay: 1. Windowed mode at 4:3 resolution which makes a part of the game unreachable (hidden behind my tackbar + going out of my display zone 2. Windowed mode unfixable by alt+enter or by launch commands on Steam 3. Crashed once 4. 5 times the game loaded a scene wrongly, hiding my cursor, my character, and the car, as well as leaving a desk-image on top of everything. I managed to 'fix' the problem by blindly finding the path to a different scene, but it didn't work once. While this happens, I cannot make the menu come up either - so all unsaved data is lost at exiting the game (which at that point was the only option to realise any kind of change).   I strongly recommend the devs to fix all their bugs before presenting us with their games. This is a joke!"
10250,PT Boats: Knights of the Sea,DO NOT BUY. The game only works for a few lucky people and otherwise it's a total waste of money.
102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"I am honestly surprised at how much I love this game. I thought this would be just something to do while I raised money and effort for the next Zelda game or a new computer to play the Witcher III on but so far I have been enjoying this game.  Pros: +The art. Not for everyone, but I love it +The voices. Every character has a voice +The world.  +The quests. +Ability to experiment in alchemy + Weapons Meh +/- Blacksmithing +/- Stealth has only a few times given me a bonus worth the effort, but those few times were epic.  Cons: - Quite a few go here clear out this dungeon quests, which I enjoy, but not for everyone.  Honestly can't think of anymore cons at the moment. Plan to buy the DLC soonish, so may update after that. "
10260,PT Boats: South Gambit,Why did I buy this?
102600,Orcs Must Die!,"Robot Entertainment have produced a slick action game here based around the popular tower defence genre. This game follows the traditional tower defence script of building traps to stop a constant stream of enemy foe but introduces player spells and weapons to assist. Far from becoming confused the game merges the 2 styles effortlessly, there are occasions when building an intricate series of diversions and traps is the order of the day and other times when equipping your poking stick and some fire gauntlets is required to smite the raging hordes. The game follows a steady learning curve, those new to tower defense games will be handheld throughout the first stages and with the game introducing new skills and abilities as you go along you will never feel overwhelmed at the pace. The games real charm rests in the war mage himself, the character story is developed via cut scenes between levels, he's equipped with a few witty one liners that he will dole out at various times and you cant help but like the guy! The graphics are good, the music is solid and atmospheric . Some people will play through it once but with the introduction of the 'skull ranking' system many will replay the levels in order to 5 skull them. In this game skulls mean upgrades and upgrades means more dead orcs! ... This game takes its place as one of the best tower defence games available today. With the announcement of a sequel on the way things are looking good for Robot Entertainment."
10270,Disciples III: Reincarnation,"This 'remastered' edition makes many changes however they seem to mess just as many things up as they fix making it hard to recomend this over the origional, even though both have their problems. I could go into exactly what was good and bad about it but at this point I'd need to replay the game to gather my thoughts again. Comment if you want me to do this... "
102700,A.V.A. Alliance of Valiant Arms™,worst game ever ♥♥♥♥ing idiots i don't care about this game it sucks they make u wait its sucks horrible game NEVER EVER PLAY THIS
102810,Gatling Gears,"Very good, polished and dissestressing"
102840,Shank 2,"A regular 2D beat em up game so awkwardly balanced it's barely playable. The game is hard, but it is super tedious to get through. The first few levels are fun until the overpowered bosses get a hold of you. I would not have a problem with this if the bosses were programmed to be as strong as me and as good as me. But they are so strong I got bored mid fight. For a fast paced action game to be like this really takes away a lot of enjoyment out of the game.   A boss fight should not be about how long you punch the guy but about how much skill it takes to land the punches. I won't even go into detail about checkpoints, whoever designed and placed them clearly had no idea what they were doing. Why? Just why? For hardcore mode going to the beginning of the level is no big deal, or even mid level. But to have it even on normal is just overkill.  Play if you enjoy small burst of enjoyment and bosses with infinitely health. "
102850,WARP,"For anyone stumbling across this review, 30,000,000 years after this game found it's final resting place deep in the bowels of the steam store; shell out your $5 to get this game. It is one of those little gems which has all the luster and charm you could possibly hope for. Adorable character, fun and interesting game mechanics, charming story and enviornments. And zero hope of the IP getting the continuation it was hoping for."
104000,iBomber Defense,"Nice game! The best TD game in steam.   pros=  -Cheap 3,99€ -Easy to play  Problems= Display"
104020,Storm in a Teacup,The game is fun and challenging without being frustrating. I recommend it. There is nothing that I disliked.
104100,Inside a Star-filled Sky ,WHAT IF YOU COULD PLAY A GAME INSIDE AN POWERUP INSIDE A GAME INSIDE AN ENEMY INSIDE THE WALL INSIDE AN ENEMY.
104200,BEEP,"This is by far one of the most value packed games I have played. For such a small price why not just grab it and try it?  It was gifted to me by a viewer and so I thought I'd give it a try and I was impressed. For an indie game there are some challenging puzzles, hours of playtime(~10 if 100% completion) and tons of infuriating moments. I can only hope that with the sale that recently featured the game that the developer will make a sequel."
10460,The Club,Game doesn't work on windows 7- there should be some kind of warning.
104600,Portal 2 - The Final Hours,"this is one of my all time favorite games ,very fun and challenging 10 out of 10"
104700,Super Monday Night Combat,Dont play this ♥♥♥♥ game.Only thing you will find is sweaty tryhards and scumbags.
104900,ORION: Prelude,this game is yes
10500,Total War: EMPIRE - Definitive Edition,You look for perfect stratregy game?Well this game is for you.     ---------------------&gt;BEST STRATREGY GAME&lt;------------------------
105000,A New Beginning - Final Cut,"started off quite well and has a very interesting plot. downside is that the characters get very dry and boring halfway through, the voice acting as well is totally emotionless. i liked a lot of the puzzles but occassionally they included one that made me wonder how in the hell they thought that would be clever, item placement can be dodgy - hidden next to another, bigger usable item  i really enjoyed the first half and would happy recommend it if they carried on the whole story like that, but they didnt, i grew bored of the plot and detached from the characters"
105100,Lume,"Lume is a pretty simple point-and-click puzzler. I feel like this works to the game's detriment. I have about 4 hours on record, and honestly, most of that was spent recording a video walkthrough. This game is short enough that it feels like a demo, as opposed to an actual game. For $5.99, I'm glad I picked this up in a bundle--I'd have felt cheated otherwise.  That said, this game is breathtaking in presentation. The graphics are simply gorgeous, and the music lends to the atmophere that ties presentation up with a beautiful bow. The puzzles are fairly unique, but I wouldn't call them challenging. Overall, this is something that could easily kill an hour or so, but there's simply not enough content to justify purchasing the game in any form other than a bundle. I'd like to see a sequel, expansion or update with significantly more content. I might change my tune if that were to happen.  UPDATE: I was unaware of the sequel. Given that the sequel is $20 and adds a mere four hours of content to the game (based on the reviews), I feel as though the sequel should have no bearing on my feelings toward Lume in general."
105300,Critical Mass,"Even at the lowest settings, this game lags with nearly unplayable frame rates. Despite the very modest requirements, this game does not play well with Windows 8.   And that 2.6hrs of gameplay? I'm pretty sure that's a bug. I've only managed to play one game, and I only played one game due to how badly it lagged."
105420,Ms. Splosion Man,"A crappy difficult platformer jumping game developed by two people. Game can be explained by one word: 'difficult'.  At the begining of the game (intro), the developer actually tries to head on against the Unreal engine. Well, you have miserably failed.  This game 'IS' developed for female players in mind. This game is so difficult, all the female players will rage quit this game and won't touch your 'xbox' or PC again. The 'xbox' is in double quotation marks because this game was initially released for the xbox.  The game is totally trial and error based, so you are going to die and learn what lies ahead, then respawn from a check point, to repeat what you just did 20 seconds ago in a loop until you could get to the end point of a level.  The worst of all is that the QTE has no indication, you will just have to figure it by yourself. Although I said QTE, it is either barrels or switches that require precisely timed button press.  If I were you, I won't look at this crappy game. Go play something else. Save your time, save your mentality."
105450,Age of Empires® III (2007),"Would recommend this game and the entire series to anyone! Great stuff, from the first game to the last."
105600,Terraria,This game is awesome. 10 Eye of cthulhu of 10 possible!
105700,Tobe's Vertical Adventure,I don't recommend this game
106000,The Cursed Crusade,"It is a well RPG, with many challenges, but also good story. The graphic's, (where I mostly don't really care), are also not that bad. Gameplay is varied, it changes between axe's, sword's, spear, shield and many more. And at this, I  can recommend this game, very well."
10680,Aliens vs. Predator,"it's meh. The balance is in favor of predator. I would only buy this game if the price drops down. It can be fun but alien is really frustrating, marine is fun and predator is OP! There will be no more DLC or any balance changes as SEGA has cut off all support. Again, only buy this game if there is a sale or you absolutely love AvP like I do. I give this game a 6/10 for a mediocre campaign with an OK multiplayer.  I reinstalled the game recently just to have fun and I'm not taking this game seriously at all, I recommend you do the same if you buy it."
107100,Bastion,Amazing game! Recommended for anyone.
107200,Space Pirates and Zombies,I changed my review to negative as it was positive on my first play hours and then I pretty much burried this game for good as it spiked from extremely easy to (for me) impossible when those parasites appear in a must-do mission. Very bad difficulty ramp management of an otherwise good game.
107300,Breath of Death VII ,"The gameplay features some really nice ideas (like the unite skills, combo boost, random encounter limit, level-up choices and enemy strength progression during battle) that I liked a lot. I didn’t care much fort he story/dialogues (sorry), but I liked the humour!"
107310,Cthulhu Saves the World ,"The greatest RPG game of all time! ♥♥♥♥ Skyrim, this game is like skyrim on steroids. Everytime i play this game i get a hard ♥♥♥♥, then i proceed to masturbate using my own tears of ♥♥♥♥ing joy that this game brings me as lubricant.  69/10"
107410,Arma 3,"10/10 great game, would play again. dank memes ;D"
107600,Waves,"Beautiful, short, fun, immersive game. Music is amazing. Scratches the itch it has to scratch. There are a few nice gameplay novelties as well, plus some interesting modes.  A little bit demanding for potato PCs, but at least try it out."
107900,War Inc. Battlezone,i realized that snorting gravel is roughly the same experience
108110,Starpoint Gemini,the most dummbest game i have ever seen
108200,Ticket to Ride,Removed support for my friends platform so I am unable to play with them. Very annoying.
108210,Memoir '44 Online,"Interesting game, reminds me of Army Men. Some scenarios are awfully hard!"
108500,Vessel,"Steampunk aesthetics and platforming never had such a happy mariage than in this puzzle adventure game. As good to the sight with its 3D assets in a 2D plane, as it is to the ears with very chill-out tunes. The puzzle fan will have some fun with solutions that require a little thinking, but never over complex executions to move forward and are always rewarding to solve.  One of the most well executed indie games of 2012, and one of the best."
108600,Project Zomboid, Early Access Review
108700,Death Rally,"I played the demo of this game for years, back in the 90s, and then the fully game at another point. The game has always been a classic. I think those interested in the racer- shooter genre will be able to appreciate it, despite it's dated graphics - just picture yourself playing a super cool tablet game on your computer instead and you'll do fine =)"
108710,Alan Wake,Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is boring.
109200,Legend of Fae,"Great cute casual game. The story is a little sad, but interesting."
109500,Fowl Space,"I used to have a friend, then he sent me this."
109700,Achron,"I was excited for the novelty of this game and was ultimately disapointed. I didn't give it much of a chance, but it wasn't very fun from what I played."
11040,Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis,"Ask yourself this before playing: Are you tough enough?  I know a guy who has logged over 2,000 hours in this game and he's still questioning his sanity."
110400,inMomentum,nice game ... Tomi xdd 10/10
11050,Dracula: Origin,"Came into this looking for an old-school adventure game with a Dracula flavour to it. The game was not exactly what I expected. It shares similarities with old-school adventure games but it has more of focused, puzzle solving approach then the inventory item hunt prevelant in most of the old Lucasarts games (which I love).  Most of the puzzle are good fun. Some are a bit too obscure. The more on-rails approach to the game flow keeps the game more focused and keeps the story moving forward.  The game can be a bit clunky but I feel the good puzzles, story and general atmosphere make up for it. A worthwhile experience."
110500,Data Jammers: FastForward,"Honestly, i wouldnt recommend this. For 10 bucks, its really not worth your money unless youve played like every other game ever. Its pretty boring, but good for killing time."
110600,Astro Tripper,1/5  An unsurprisingly uninspired SHMUP.
110630,Mutant Storm Reloaded,"Bought this since I was such a big fan of the original, but it was a bit of a let down.  The controls in this are much less smooth than the original, and the visuals are much less trippy. Unfortuantely Pom Pom no longer seems to sell the orignal version except for some iPad remake. In anycase I'd recommend the orignal 'Mutant Storm' if you can find it, but would avoid this 'Reloaded' version."
110800,L.A. Noire,This game has something special: real actors.
111000,The Clockwork Man,"Meh.  The puzzles are okay, the plot is shallow, and the character art is dreadful. Miranda is okay, but everyone else looks like stiff mannequins with dead eyes. But the hidden object gameplay, that mostly consists of forcing miranda to clean other peoples messy houses (they leave like mangoes and butter knives everywhere) can be pretty relaxing, since it's mostly your eyes working. I would probably recommend it if they spent some more time making a more interesting story. This one ends suddenly just when you start to get somewhere and its buh-bye."
111010,The Clockwork Man: The Hidden World,The ending credits are longer than the game itself. 3/10
111100,Snuggle Truck,"It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.  Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.  (Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over. I won't hold that against the game, but it was still very frustrating)"
11130,Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of The Mummy,This game will not work! It has sound only with a black screen and will lovck your computer up. MAny manY people share this same problem. Thankfully I bought this as a bundle. Do not waste your money!
111300,Smash Cars,"100% on the PS2 version, a little dissapointed with this one but it's still fun.   I Highly recommend the PS2 version to anyone who enjoyed this one.  PS2 - 8/10 Much more content, severely dated graphics.  PC 5.5/10 Severely lacking in content compared to PS2 version, looks phenomenal  My personal opinon, your mileage may vary."
11140,Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened - Remastered,"It wouldn't work. No matter what we did to try an fix it it would not run. Spent 2 hours reading guides for the error that popped up and nothing. The worse part is, is that I bought it with all the other Sherlock games so no refund all because Jack the Ripper worked."
111400,Bunch Of Heroes,Pretty clunky game. Wave-based top down shooter. Probably only fun with a player 2.
11150,Sherlock Holmes: The Secret of the Silver Earring,Would recommend. You have to be meticulous and think outside of the box throughout most of the game. But then again that's the point if you're playing a Sherlock game.
111600,Serious Sam Double D XXL,"Plays this a few years ago, just got back to it. Still awesome."
11180,Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of The Persian Carpet,"As usual it would be nice to have more than thumbs up or thumbs down for recommendations.   This is a very casual point and click/hidden object adventure game. As advertised, you take on the role of legendary supersleuth, Sherlock Holmes, and point and click your way around old London solving a crime. The gameplay takes the form of a hidden object phase followed by a puzzle phase, assembling torn up notes or erasing a painting to see what was underneath. The gameplay here is a little like popping bubblewrap.   Graphics and artwork aren't terrible, but you're pillarboxed if you own a widescreen monitor, despite having support for 4K monitors, which is a bit weird. If you like point and click, and you have a 15 year old monitor, go for it.   Otherwise the weird pillarboxing and too, too casual gameplay stops this one from getting over the line."
111800,Blocks That Matter,"Interesting Puzzle game with Blocks, try it."
11190,Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper,"So far this game has been very fustrating because it will not save regularly. I once lost 30 minutes of progressing because the game would not allow me to save, so I just finial logged. A second time after 90 minutes of place the game lock my computer up while trying to use the map. I had made a save point after a key moment in the game but it was lost after I rebooted. This game's save game feature is buggy which suck the fun out of the play."
111900,Guardians of Middle-earth,"Honest... I wish a better company had this idea. lotr is great, but unfortunatly thier are few good games."
11200,Shadowgrounds: Survivor,"Ok game, not a bad shooter, but it's plagued with issues that the devs know about but won't fix.   A well known issue is a crash on a near end level. Devs solution is to download another save game, and load from there.   Don't buy this game, and don't buy from these devs who only do a half finished product.  It's a shame since the game would have been recommended if it wasn't for the awful bugs."
112100,Avadon: The Black Fortress,"Spiderweb Software has done it again! Set in a highly detailed and well-written world, what 'Avadon' lacks in graphics it makes up for in story. Featuring an epic fantasy world and many memorable characters (your party, should you choose to have one, will often comment on the action during the story, a la 'Baldur's Gate'), this is an indie game that any fan of the RPG genre should be happy to support.  Being rather fond of Spiderweb's earlier series 'Avernum', which features a very detailed character generation system (where one selects their races, perks, etc), I admit that I was initially somewhat off-put by the character generation system in 'Avadon' (in which one chooses one of four classes, each with their own skill tree). With that said, each of the classes can be customized a great deal."
11230,Gumboy Tournament,"If your response to this game is anything other than wanting to violently bash your nose against a wall, you clearly see something in this game I don't."
11250,Pacific Storm,"I played this game before Steam started tracking gameplay hours. Rest assured, I gave it its second, third, and fourth chances. I can safely say that this game is a piece. Of. ♥♥♥♥.  Buy this only if you want to hear the words 'FIYYUUH' over and over and over and over and over again."
11260,Pacific Storm: Allies,"One of my favorite games of all time! PTO2 for the SNES. I ♥♥♥♥ myself with happiness when I found this modern day 'clone' and bought it asap.   All the gameplay systems are laid out and there wonderful, just what I wanted from this game. 10/10  But making it all work is the real killer for this game. Somehow they completely FAILED to bug check this and that infuriates me! It has EVERYTHING that I want, but it just doesn't work!  5 hours of pain because this game has everything that I want."
11280,Penguins Arena: Sedna's World,"I've played very little at the time of this review.  Pros +Penguins are awesome. +Graphics look nice. +Controls are responsive. +Funish...  Cons -The game crashes with out fail after every match if in fullscreen. -The game resets video options after every restart of the game. -The OS can start to become unstable if you crash because of being in fullscreen. -When you die you are placed as a ghost penguin in wierd places, unable to move and in terrible view of what is actually happening. What makes this worse is that the maps are just large enough that it can take upwards of 10+ minutes for one of the last two penguins to die, leaving you trapped waiting.   In addition to being trapped and unable to move, you are given the ability to shoot what I can only assume are ghostly eggs but your aim is virtually non-existent.  Now if the glaring issues are ever resolved I would highly recommend this game. It could be the perfect fast paced mini game it wants to be if some changes were to be made. The maps are just too large and that forces matches to last longer than needed and with the other problems just makes it less fun.  I do think I'll continue to play a few matches here and there for a long while but I can't honestly see myself playing for long periods. If you watch some videos and think it looks fun I would get it. I just can't recommend a game with so many glaring problems. Although I do love mechanics of pushing penguins off of an island. It reminds me of some of these mini games that were on the first xbox back when I was a kid. I loved those and I'd still play those today if available for PC. "
113020,Monaco,requires another player (found via matchmaking) to play any portion of the game. not even tutorial is accessible solo. 0/10 do not buy  i had to leave the game open for 5 minutes to be able to write this review. it only took 2 minutes to change settings and find out that there's no single player function
113200,The Binding of Isaac,in the words of larry david. Pretty pretty good
11340,Larva Mortus,Surprisingly good arcade top-down shooter.
113400,APB Reloaded,This over all in build is a nice game really cool build and art makeing sytem to it.  But but the biggest problem so over looked is the pay to win if you pay for the over tope guns and then go to the low level zone its eays picking wich kills off new players really unless you have too much money in game and levels also there is no real balnce to the game what so ever.  In the end this game will make you rage quit its a love hate kind of one i hope one day the dev team for APB will think about fixing the problems and working on other elements too.
113420,Fallen Earth,It suck serious ♥♥♥ 
11360,Chains,"Quite an interesting little casual game, I picked it up on sale and recommend you to do the same. It doesn't seem to have very many levels, but the few it does have are entertaining enough."
11370,Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals,Most things you have to find are hided from view with darkness and that's imo lame. Some decisions are time based so if you r looking for a chill out adventure - this is not the one. I haven't read book thus plot appeared really boring to me and I couldn't find the strength to continue with this game.
11390,Crash Time 2,"Okay, this game was way more fun than I expected. Simple racing/chasing fun!"
11450,Overlord,"For the IMMATURE! About an hour into the game I wish the minions would shut up. Missions are repetitive and characters are all unlikeable. The jester, the mistress, the overlord.. all unlikeable, and not in a way that's interesting. They're just all very annoying."
11480,Soldiers: Heroes of World War II," TLDR:   Picture yourself nursing an LSD-induced sense of bravado as you watch re-coloured b&amp;w WWII movies on a 6' Zenith - all the while, being jazzed to the core from injesting copious amounts of Pop Rocks and Dr. Pepper (with your wife yelling at you in the background). That's kinda like this game.   Pros:   + Impressive modeling of vehicles + Historically accurate unit representation + Immersive graphics and battle sounds + Highly detaled soldier actions/responses + Covers US, German, UK, and Russians   Mids:   * Music can get annoying (also LOUD) * Some tanks feel stretched out (wide) * Unpolished voice-overs lack credibility * No true multiplayer (death-match) mode * Limited to static pre-programmed missions   Cons:   - Hard to make out elevation and angles - AI appears to be overly accurate/effective - Ridiculously difficult missions (like puzzles) - No dynamic content (little replay value) - Discontinued with no DLC or expansions   Conclusion:   Single-player and co-op real-time game (with action pause). Similar to the titles in the Blitzkrieg series (though with a far more polished UI and better graphics). If you can overlook being limited to a few multi-mission campaigns (30 missions total - over 4 campaigns), extreme difficultly, and cheesy music/voice-overs, then you will find this to be a keeper.  For enthusiasts of tactical combat games that are up for a serious challenge, this will be right up your alley. This is an impressive game with a rich historical flavor, offset occasionally by some highly fictionalized missions. The soldiers mimic real-life behavior, the responses to situations are believable, and chaos rules. While the battles may not reflect real-world circa 40's enagaments, they are loads of masochistical fun. I personally like it quite a bit.  But damn... the difficulty :)  Thumbs up - if for no reason other than my being a glutten for punishment (lol)."
115100,Costume Quest,"I wish more games were like this: inexpensive (writing this during a sale), fun and finishable in short amount of time. I wouldn't have such a huge backlog otherwise. Also props to the battle system: honestly I think all turn-based games should have some timing elements in them. That way you get the best of both worlds: some tactics and action.  It's not overly complicated or difficult, and the variation of costumes adds some fun to the mix. Definitely a game worth getting so you can have something to do to help build the halloween spirit before the holiday."
115110,Stacking,"Tust really, really dull, it's actually pretty fun at the start up untill the point when you realise you are pretty much doing the same puzzle over and over again and the solutions are really simple, the npcs will also tell you the answer just incase you are really stupid aswell, for example it's not unusual to see phrases like 'don't do X'.   They also put the key dolls very close to the puzzles, trying to figure out all the solutions for each puzzle isnt really entertaining after a couple of hours because sometimes it's just doing the EXACT same thing with a different doll and a lot of times, i should say, every time you complete a puzzle you have to watch the same 5 second cutscene, it's annoying. for 1 dollar i'd say it worth it because the atmosphere(outside of the booring story)just the envrioments filled with interesting detail and seeing what each doll does is suprisingly fun but the game is highly held back by unispired puzzles, it became so grabbed by the idea of multiple solutions that there isnt any decent well thought out puzzle in the game,   There isnt a single puzzle in the game that makes you go think for a good couple of minutes before you figure it out."
115120,Iron Brigade,"A great coop game, just buy it already."
115200,Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars,One of main the Best real-time strategy games for PC. Recommend for people who like strategy games. If you can get whole set of cossacks pack is cheep is $20. Great Mutiplayer. &gt;:)
115210,American Conquest,Very fun game that I have a TON of nostalgia for.
115220,American Conquest - Fight Back,upload American HEW version.   I am eager to upload
115320,PROTOTYPE 2,Game was unplayable
11560,Maelstrom,"Yea i dont recommend this game because two things 1. its not very intristing and is very difficult to catch on to, even for a person who has been playing strategy games there whole life... 2. You can not play on multiplayer for some dumb reason which i hope they fix than i may change my review..."
115800,Owlboy,"It's too damn fun but too damn short as a result, you can finish all of it in two sessions of 6 hours."
11590,Hospital Tycoon,"I was actually enjoying this game when it hit a wall and either bugged or glitched, or I just couldnt figure out how to progress so I got stuck in limbo. Restarted from scratch to try and learn and follow directions better, wound up in the same glitch where i couldn't complete objectives. This quickly led to disinterest and I moved on."
116100,Super Toy Cars,"An extremely tepid, generic, forgettable experience. It's a decent time-waster, for sure, and I genuinely have to admire the sense of scale and speed, as well as the colorful track design. However, the concerningly massive number of typos are a first sign that the experience is a bit slapdash, and the downright uncomfortable drifting mechanic makes Ridge Racer Unbounded seem comparatively intuitive (this game has two ways to use the handbrake and neither really works well).  AI competitors are inept to a childish degree, and I don't mean how a child plays a video game like this. I mean when they're bored inside a real car and run the car up a wall and then keep bumping it against the seat. I watched in amused awe as no less than three of the AI at once all decided not to take the turn ahead and instead wedge themselves into a corner, respawn before the corner, and do it again. And again. And again.  Visually, it's a mess. I mean, it's very neatly modeled and colorful and well designed, but this is all marred by a very questionable blurring effect that applies depth of field or... something, extremely wonkily. It just looks like vaseline smeared on random parts of the camera.  Audio-wise, the actual vehicle audio is decently okay. The pop-style soundtrack is genuinely impressive, except for the very repetitive main menu tune. Like, seriously, I see why the soundtrack provider is shown prominently in advertising for the game and on the first loading screen. It's pretty damn good. Though with lyrics about having women in one arm and booze in the other, it makes me figure this isn't supposed to be a kid's game, which makes me wonder who it actually IS for. Bored twenty-somethings and up looking for a bit of nostalgia of the good old days banging toy cars against each other like myself, I suppose. In any case, I totally want to find more of the musician's work, because it's really great, really serene. The high point of the game by a long shot.  I have extremely fond memories of Mad Tracks, and absolutely love racing games in general. Toy car racing games are a rather rare niche, especially outside of top-down games in the vein of Micro Machines, but even then, this fails to stand out. I obtained it in a bundle with many other cheap indie racing titles. I switched vehicles and noticed that the one I picked, the WRC4, bizarrely steered itself around the track for some reason. After that and a rehashed mission type with mines added where it turns out all the AI immediately steered into mines and blew themselves up, only for me to hit one and launch ahead  faster  and win, I gave up. Not terrible, but there are so many great racing games crying out for your attention, time, and wallet that this just isn't worth it. As it is, I'll likely just leave it running for cards and not bother booting it again."
116120,Lightfish,I've played this type of game before and I feel like this is just a clone. It's good if you like the type of game though. I personally feel like it gets old a bit. These were the type of games I played back then when my uncle's PC was crap. I kinda like it and it's good for five dollars but I like the original where the enemies actually destroyed the captured area. Forgot what it was called but it was on RealArcade.
11900,Lumines,"An incredible way to kill time. Not a fan of the low resolution, though."
11920,Lumines: Advanced Pack,YOU TOO. YOU ARE THE WORST. YOU ARE JUST THE ♥♥♥♥ING WORST. YOU SHOWER OF GEOMETRIC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S
1200,Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45,"Much fun, really fun to drive tanks with friends."
12130,Manhunt,"Found this game on my uncle's laptop in ~2005. Keep coming back to it. It's in my top 5 favourite games. Told my classmates about it. They played it, and we had fun sneaking behind one another right before breaks and using plastic bags. It made us all paranoid after 2-3 weeks, and we all ended talking with each other with our backs glued to the walls. 6th grade was fun, this game brings that back."
12140,Max Payne,"Although heralded for its bullet time back in the day, this run and gun isnt worth the price of a stamp.  Its a one trick pony of shoot some guys then go shoot a few more from end to end and in earnest doesnt deserve the title of being labelled a game. On the bright side though, playing games like this help you appreciate others more.  The only way to play this game is on the hardest settings as dying and repeating is quite simply the only fun to be had in this outing."
12150,Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,"the second part of smth is always suppose to be better. and y, its better than 1st half.  this game is absolutely GEM in big game industry. 10/10"
12170,Grand Theft Auto,"Take it to the edge, there's nowhere to hide And call up the boys, let's go for a joyride"
12180,Grand Theft Auto 2,Dated as ♥♥♥♥ part 2 Electric Buguloo
12200,Bully: Scholarship Edition,"Great game, terrible port.  'It's an old game' is not an excuse. There are dozens of games even older than this one that work fine on newer systems.   If any developer chooses not to update their game to make it more compatible with new computers and operating systems, then I think it should be removed from Steam, plain and simple. Really, this goes for any game that isn't working, with or without updates; it should be taken down from the store.  Think about it. What will become of this port if Microsoft finally decides to finish forcing everyone to update to Windows 10? I'll tell you what: It'll become utterly unplayable by anyone on PC.  I wish I could recommend it, I really do. But without a much needed update or patch, the game in its current state is broken for just about anyone that has an OS newer than Vista. In time, it'll become obsolete."
12210,Grand Theft Auto IV: The Complete Edition,Probably best story of GTA series i've ever played
12220,Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City,As you could see i have 9-60 idk HRS only but i spent most of my time playing without paul.dll and using the launcher in the file.   Since the newest update I couldnt Play my Gta IV/EFLC even using the launcher i removed all of my mods and car models and verifyed my game then it said it was all fine. When i ran the game the rockstar startup was up and running as usual but after i press play. the thing closed and the game stopped running. Yes i knew there was something removed and im not sure if it was needed but i did it anyway  i would recomend this once the game is fixed for real 
12310,Culpa Innata,"This game is different. Although it is a dated game, the visuals are good and the story is excellent. Is there some truth in this? Can it be possible that the world will become like this?  Just play the game. ;-)"
12320,Sacred Gold,"While everyone of my friends was playing Diablo I was playing Sacred. Yes this game is very telling for its age but my god does it scratch that itch that Diablo never manged to hit, A robost character system, Each character actually felt different in terms of game play and abilities and the massive world.  Yes the voice over work is terrible. (not as bad as sacred 2 or 3's but still pretty bad)  mainly bought it again so I had a steam and modern computer capable version. "
12330,DarkStar One,Not a bad little game. Reminds me of the Galaxies on fire games.
12340,Jack Keane,Love both of the Jack Keane games. I have replayed the first one so many times and it never gets old. Hope there is more to come!
12360,FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage,"The game uses Games For Windows Live. GFWL has been shut down, permanently.  ONLY buy this game if you intend to play the singleplayer.   There is no LAN multiplayer, and since you can't log into GFWL with anything but an offline account, multiplayer effectively doesn't exist.  Thanks, Microsoft."
12420,Perimeter 2: New Earth,"Perimeter 1 is a much better and more interesting game. They really lost their way with this one. Buggy, irritating terraforming system, fewer factions than the previous game, terrible UI.  Just get the first one and its expansion and pretend this game never happened."
12430,SlamIt Pinball: Big Score,"Works great/smooth for me on Windows 10 64-bit in 1980 by 1080, albeit I am using a Radeon HD R9-390 video which runs everything.  Played multiple games no crashes.  Read that it's a dead title because the main programmer was killed in a car accident in 2010.  RIP   This thumbs up for you!  I enjoyed the table, not pinball snob though.  "
12450,Ankh 3: Battle of the Gods,"The omens of the Battle of the Gods have been many, signaling the impending fight for supremacy over all other gods of Egypt. And of course, Assil will be caught in the middle of it all again. Together with his girlfriend Thara, he will have to prevent the sinister Seth from winning the battle and subjecting Egypt to his regime of terror. With the typical Ankh humour, numerous bizarre characters and gags by the wagonload, Ankh - Battle Of The Gods is again a candidate for the adventure gaming throne.  Battle Of The Gods feature several new locations, including Luxor, the gambling capital of ancient Egypt. And an unexpected trip takes Assil to a far-away, exotic location, where he will have to deal with the entirely unfamiliar conventions of its native people. The new Ankh features even more detailed character models and smoother animations."
12460,BC Kings,"This game.. is Terrible. A really cheap rip off of Warcraft/Age Of Empires. not really anyhting else I can say other than, Please dont buy this? i spent 5 miniuets of agony playing this.. I couldnt take anymore. 2/10 Unoriginal idea, done VERY poorly."
12470,Port Royale 2,Excellent game. i was looking for a simple trading game for ages spending money on really bad games but this small game that i discovered by mistake is one of the best games i have played to date. 10/10
12480,9th Company - Roots of Terror,"Fantastic game. A hidden treasure. Excellent atmosphere. If you like tactical games, this is something you will love. A little short and an occasional bugg (mission events not triggering) can force you to restart a mission from time to time, but an excellent experience. To add to the historical atmosphere of the 1970s, when you succesfully finish a mission you get rewarded by the Soviet anthem playing, Recommendations."
1250,Killing Floor,  Death is one thing but blowing a zeds head off is another thing BUT WATCHING IT IN SLOW MOTION is another thing wanna blow an arm off? YOU CAN EVEN IN SLOW MO   100/5 BLOW THAT ARM OFF
12500,Puzzle Quest,"This is one game I really love, It's a match 3 game with an aventure in it. I own this game on 3 different machines now. There is a part 2 to this game which is also fun to play. I also have Gems Of War by this company too &amp; i'm on level 222. These are awesome match 3 games that anyone can play &amp; enjoy for tons of hours &amp; replay value is a given."
12520,18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul,Great game. LOve it. I like the size of the map
12530,Hunting Unlimited 2008,"It's ok, even if you play it on today. The bullet effects is realistic, you can see the cam through the hunting."
12560,Ride! Carnival Tycoon,Rollercoaster Tycoon ripoff
12570,Hot Dish,It's a little ones click cooking game. Not bad for what it is but don't spend more than $5 on it.
12580,Dr. Daisy: Pet Vet,"First, a note: This game seems to have serious functionality issues in Windows 10. Or, at least it does on my system. No matter what compatibility setting I use, it still only runs for a short while before crashing. Fortunately though, I did play it a bit on my old Windows 8 computer, so the small amount of refresher time was enough to at least feel able to leave a fair review.  As far as the gameplay goes: it is a time management game. Unfortunately, it does it in the worst way. That is, while this is marketed as a veterinary game, the gameplay is literally just rapidly clicking as fast as you possibly can. You basically click the animal once to evaluate them, and then go to the medicine cabinet to get a syringe, then click the animal again to give them the shot. Sometimes there's a contagious disease that requires hand-washing or the need to go grab the x-ray machine to use on some patients, but even then, it's all just rapid clicking. This is a game that would have gained so much from the inclusion of mini-games or even just different diagnosis/treatment possibilities, or something. Plus, the 'upgrades' are insufficient. You quickly get up to having six beds to make use of, spread across the room, but you can't move that far quickly enough to not make it seem more like a chore rather than fun in trying to reach the goal score.  Educational value-wise, I'd say there's really none, though it tries in some ways in-game to pretend otherwise. Granted, it isn't marketed as such in the store, so I can't fault it much for that. Though I would suggest that adding some real educational value would have helped the game a LOT - even if only by making it be a great game for kids.  The graphics and such are pretty much what one expects from such games, so I don't fault those. The main problem, really, is that it just doesn't take advantage of what it could have been."
12590,Sprint Cars: Road to Knoxville,"Controller support is practically non existant and game stutters.  If you want a good sprint car game, find the sprint car/dirt track racing games from Ratbag games.... they're older but so much better than this..."
12630,Legend: Hand of God,"I really wanted to like this game and put a fair amount of time into it, but it's simply broken. Too many bugs and glitches. This was not tested or polished before being realeased. It is a very frustrating experience. Save your money and play something thst works. Even on sale it wasn't worth it. There are many better games of this genre too."
12640,Drakensang,Old school RPG with light humor. Hours of fun.
12670,Mission Runway,        YouTube™ Video:  Let's Short Play Episode 3: Mission Runway&nbsp;
12690,Hunting Unlimited 2010,  -Found Black Bear -Followed It -Ran Down A Hill -I Ran Down The Hill -Found Its Dead Corpse  11/10 Would Break A Black Bear's Legs Again
12710,Overlord: Raising Hell,"Plenty of humor. Plenty of chaos. And plenty of missions. The 'Raising Hell' edition's extended play makes for a much more involved, non-linear adventuring experience.  Definately a game worth playing. "
12750,GRID,"I want to like this game, but I can't. It is unplayable at higher difficulty levels and the game rewards more for playing them. If you play on lower difficulty levels it's fine - plenty of cheap fun. The AI isn't very aggressive and you can move around freely enough to actually race. Once you start to crank the difficulty level up, the AI starts to play bumper cars instead of racing. They brake for each other, but slam right into you. Forget being able to take a corner without getting spun out by someone hitting your rear quarter panel. You basically end up having to restart every race a dozen times if you even want to finish. Completely ruins any fun you intended on having."
12770,Rise of the Argonauts,"Fourteen minutes into the game, and it crashes. Best moment of my life, to be honest.  The game isn't very good. Hit detection is off, which is very, very bad for an Action RPG game, not that I made it to the RPG part.  I played the game very little, due to the crash, and I honestly don't think it's worth giving another shot.  2/10"
12790,Damnation,"The shooting is absolute garbage, basically Gears of War but with no cover system and far less polish. The parkour is also garbage, you make the same 5 jumps over and over again to either make your way up or down buildings, and it's incredibly boring.  The voice acting and writing are both cringe-worthy levels of terrible. The level design could've been aight if not for the fact that the actual levels are just the same buildings repeatedly 75% of the time. As a result, the worlds look nice but it's horridly boring making your way through them. Also, I get this was on a budget, but the graphics look like they're from 2004 and this game came out in 2009. Riding the bikes was only fun when we were finding creative ways to crash, otherwise it's just driving straight/turning/maybe hitting a jump, with no actual challenge involved whatsoever.  Also, bugs. Bugs bugs bugs. At least 4 times me and a buddy had to get ourselves killed because of glitches that prevented either one or both of us from progressing. This wasn't so bad it was good, it was just bad."
12830,Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising,"At first I had compatibility issues with the game. When I finally managed to get the game running I was quite disappointed - it certainly is not a war simulator as one would expect.  The main issues I have with it - my squad got resurrected and certain waypoints, enemies ignore fire (shooting a guard did not even make the other seek out cover if I was far enough), you could simply repair almost destroyed vehicles by yourself in the middle of a warzone, using an MG means your face gets slapped to a huge ugly black sight blocking thing and you can turn only very slowly and so on... Also, the game feels incredibly scripted. If you use the open world and prioritize a different target than what the game aimed for, you completely derail their narrative and briefings etc.  I still liked the fast squad command style, athough it took a while to get used to. In general I had a better military feeling from Star Wars Commandos and OF:Dragon rising just manages to remind me of that feeling.  I guess the Rambo-like theme playing in the trailer is actually a good choice for the style of the game."
130,Half-Life: Blue Shift,"Graphics: 8/10 Well, slightly better than before. Gameplay: 7/10 Even though there are some good scenes in this, most of it is either a short story segment where you get your next order, or you fighting against enemies, and than solving a puzzle, only to fight against more enemies. Creativity: 7/10 Aside from some interesting puzzles, there isn't much of it in it. Story: 5/10 Aside from having to many unanswered questions for players who are new to Half-Life, there is a main goal (to escape), consisting of many side goals, in a continuos row, even though it's always obvious what happens, and that's it. Difficulty: 4/10 Way to easy, and a real dissappointment. Length: 6/10 Typical Add-On. Final Thoughts: 7/10 It's ok, but it really is just a shooter with a lot of action, and some puzzles, but not really what you'd expect from a Half-Life game."
1300,SiN Episodes: Emergence,"This is not for SIN Episodes : Emergence its for the 1st game that came in this 2 -pack game SIN the older game it never played and i had it over 2 years and they wonder why people stop buying games at this site, i off course purchesed another game that will not play also you think when you have an account it should be seem that the game never was played... Just go to show you no brainer.. don't get the old game"
13000,Ninja Reflex: Steamworks Edition,"If you are bad at the FPS games, this is a thing you can train yourself with! Just as long as you don't mind the crippling blow to your dignity.  Also if you actually try to meditate with the game, there's a feature where I come to your house and set you on fire."
1313,SiN: Gold,HAHAHAHAHAAAA. NOT RECOMMENDED. THis came free with a cheap copy of Sin Emergence. It was not bad back in 1998 but seriously now? You would be better off playing Quake (Everyones got that by now?)
13140,America's Army 3,"This is my 2nd time downloading this game (and will proceed to un-installing it after this review). I was hoping they have improved it but it's still crap. Version 2 was the best, I had so much fun on that one. This version is just all around ♥♥♥♥. There are better free-to-play games out there."
13200,Unreal II: The Awakening,The final few levels are worthy of being an Unreal sequel.
13210,Unreal Tournament 3: Black Edition,it keeps shutting itself off
13230,Unreal Tournament 2004,"UTz! I've had so much fun playing this game in the past. I picked it up recently after 10 years. It reminds me of a simpler time when games were just fun and simple. The mechanics are perfect, the gameplay is fun. The only problem now is finding a server to play on. There aren't as many options as there used to be. But if you can find people to play with this is great game."
13240,Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition,"First off, BUY THIS GAME. If you like shooters, then this game is already perfect. Even if you aren't playing this for nostalgia, its still an amazing game. It honestly became my favorite FPS game. I will do a simple Pros/Cons list.    *PROS*   +Very High Fun factor  +Diversity in guns/Pick-ups  +Good soundtrack, but the sound effects on each weapon feels awesome  +Playing against bots is actually really fun because how well coded they are to actually be a good healthy challenge  +THE MAP DESIGN IS PERFECT, each game mode has unique maps that are always fun to explore and learn  +The visuals/graphics are very pleasing. Yes the game is from 1999, but the environments look great. Each weapon has awesome particle effects that still impress.   +Can run on pretty much every computer, so if you are a person with a slower computer I'm almost certain that this game will run just fine with very smooth frame rates. (If you experience lag, try minimizing it and just stretch it out to full screen on the window, for some reason when I ran it on my ♥♥♥♥ laptop the only way I was able to fix it was that)  *CONS*  -Multiplayer community isn't very active, but there are still people are playing it.    Overall : 9.75 Must buy game."
13250,Unreal Gold,"Unreal blew me away in the early days of hardware accelerated gaming. This was a title worth updating my hardware for. It's still surprisingly solid these days, with just a bit of tweaking to cope with modern hardware. Open levels feel sparse by today's standards but the excellent ambient sounds help maintain a sense of atmosphere. AI still feels cunning, and the weapon selection brutal and varied. Definitely recommended for anyone seeking to plot the history and evolution of the FPS genre."
13500,Prince of Persia: Warrior Within,This game is by far one of the best games of it's genre i've played.
13520,Far Cry,It's ight.
13530,Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones,"Graphically it's an improvement over the Sands of Time. Combat is still not my favorite and the platforming isn't the best. I gave up after a while, as dying constantly isn't fun. Really would have liked to be able to play as both aspects of the character."
13540,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas,"One of the best FPS I've played, primarily because the setting was just so unique."
13560,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell,I knocked out 2 dozen people and placed them all in the same closet about the size of a bathroom stall.  10/10
13570,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory,"Played trough it on xbox, and just bought it for PC Because of memories and the gameplay. 9/10, gameplay and story is fantastic i just have a small problem with the game crashing while trying to record the screen And having more than one monitor/screen causing the game to crash or not beeing able to start the game. Otherwise amazing game, best of the franchise."
13580,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent,GET IT!
13600,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,"The story is presented as a tale being told by the prince.  The Prince is tricked into unleashing the sands of time, turning everyone except the Prince and Farah into sand creatures, also unlocking the ability to alter time itself with the dagger of time. This is the games main gimmick. And it's a fun one, using his powers the prince must undo the damage he's done, aided by his AI companion Princess Farah. She's a capable partner in the many different puzzles and combat sections. And the Princes love interest. The pair have excellent chemistry and it does a lot for the games story. And the ending is still pretty good. It's not revolutionary. But it was a satisfying enough conclusion for me.  The game runs like a dream. It didn't crash a single time for me. There are 3 tweaks to enhance the graphics. A widescreen patch, and forced anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering. And one fix for a commmon issue on modern hardware.  Now texture quality is about as consistent as the aim of a stormtrooper with alcoholism, having some of the all time muddiest looking textures I've ever seen and a few very sharp ones that aged well. Some of the glow and particle effects still look pretty good. Water has a wierd pixellation that's awful to look at. Each area is very unique and detailed. The textures might look like ♥♥♥ but you can see what they were going for. And it's beautiful. The two characters animations are solid. The amount of detail on the prince is downright impressive. Most of the enemies still look very good. Their animations telegraph certain incoming attacks and despite each enemy type being only a copy of it itself, I feel like these aged just fine. Creatures like beatles and birds still look pretty good.  I'm terrible at judging sound and voice quality. But generally I had no problem believing the two main characters as they delivered their lines. The rest of the sound does a decent job with all of the sound effects being believable for me.  The music is great.. but I didn't feel like it was used enough. Sometimes the absence of music is a good thing, but here it just feels strange. I found myself wondering if I was having a bug with the music not playing. When you do hear it, mostly during combat, it's exciting and I enjoyed each track. They all fit their moments pretty well for me.  The Prince can run on walls, jump across pits filled with spikes, and climb crumbling ledges to traverse the enviroment. This is the games greatest strength as it throws platforming puzzles, traps and sometimes flying enemies at the player while you're climbing. The platforming sections feel very rewarding, and each one is a thrill to complete.  Combat is fast paced and controls are handled well. Balacing when its right to strike, block, dodge or use the dagger to kill enemies who are knocked down. The game usually throws packs of different enemies at you at once all with different strengths and weaknesses to keep the experience from getting stale, Unfortunately it ends up being hindered by overstaying it's welcome. Almost every fight goes on a longer than it needs to and the combat began to feel repetitive because of this. I found myself just wanting to get back to the next platforming section halfway through each fight. You do get one ability that helps with mitigate this a little, but it isn't enough.   There isn't really replayability here. After you've finished the game you won't have the desire to play it again. At least not for a while.  The controls themselves still work great. And you'll get used them quickly. All of the controls can be rebound, but I didn't feel like I needed to. Platforming and Combat feels good, responsive and smooth as long as the camera is cooperating.  Is it still fun? Yes. Absolutely. It's a blast. Thanks to it's fantastic platforming, solid puzzles, interesting story and characters and excellent soundtrack. It manages to not get dragged down by its faults. In many ways it is showing it's age. But after 13 years I have to say Prince of Persia : Sands of Time still holds up.  My video review :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOiIYwtyyA "
13620,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Desert Siege,"I bought this because I was desperate for more Ghost Recon missions. The maps are not that good. The desert gets dull easily, and if you have a good sniper on your squad, the long sight lines of the map make this a cakewalk. Only buy this if you really want more Ghost Recon."
1500,Darwinia,"i suspect i probably got this game 11 years too late. i just can't bring myself to accept the controls of this game now, where 11 years ago, i would've played this for non-stop.  I recommend this for people who wants a new RTS, although, i'm tempted to say, I'd rather re-play total annhiliation instead."
15000,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Lockdown a fair game like a simulator but a bit buggy. It's not bad and quite a classic game overall.
15080,Rayman: Raving Rabbids,you can put tour rubber in rabbits
1510,Uplink,"Verdict: Will replay  Uplink is a game where you play as a 1980s hacker, ala war games. Dani and I actually went over the first 15 minutes in order to finish the tutorial, which is all we had time to do.  I was extremely intrigued by the premise. I actually tried to create a role playing system once that played with many of the same ideas as what I'm seeing here in this game. I liked the tension that's generated during a hack as you frantically try to achieve your objectives without being traced. I like the paranoia it induces, and the mood/writing is pretty great.  The interface though leaves a bit to be desired though. The fact that I had to use a mouse so much drew me out of the fantasy a bit. How hard would it be to link in libreadline and allow someone to tab complete commands? The interface also has buttons all over the place,so the learning curve felt a bit steep. Going forward, I don't know if that is something that would annoy me more and more or whether it's something I would get over."
15100,Assassin's Creed,"Assassin's Creed  Story - It gets a bit repetitive, do these investigations, go talk to some dude, kill this dude, go back to Masyaf, repeat. I'm not sayingit's bad, it is fun. It's just the same objectives over and over again, EXCEPT for the last 2 memories. Those really got me wondering. The ending was really cool. Loved it. 7/10  Storyline Length -10-ish hours if you decide to do ALL the investigations.  AI - They have the exact same skill as you. They can counter, they can climb buildings, they can grab, grab break, dodge, so on. They're challenging. Especially at the start when you can't do ANY of those things. 9/10  Experience - Other than the story being repetitive, you'll love this game for many reasons. You'll love it for Altair's amazing voice, the brutal counter-kills, the freedom you have once you've unlocked everything, the horses, Malik being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Abbas being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's all just really glorious once you know how to play the game. 10/10  Graphics - Pretty great for 2007. Could be a bit better on shadows though. 9/10   Sounds / Voice Acting - Well, Altair has an American accent despite living somewhere in the Middle East. I'm just going to assume that's the power of the Animus though. La shay' wakion motlak bal kollon momken. 8/10  Controls - Like any other game I suppose, it's easy to learn, comfortable to play with. 10/10  Overall - 9/10  It's an amazing game, I feel like everyone should get a chance to play this, even if they don't really like action / adventure games all that much. I really enjoyed playing this when it first came out, and you know you've done an amazing job at a game if I still find myself enjoying it nearly 10 years later. I hope for the 10 year anniversary of this they make a remaster of this. It'd be so cool ^^ "
15120,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2,bought it yestaday hoping it would be the same as it was years ago on xbox it is seen a few people complaining about it not working on windows 10 works for me fine everything and this is 2017
15130,Beyond Good & Evil,"First of all, don't purchase this game on Steam unless you still have a Windows XP gaming system. There are a multitude of technical issues that will likely make it unplayable for you. So if you have an old console lying around it was on just about all of them, or play it on an emulator, Dolphin worked perfectly.  If you do put the effort into actually playing, there's not a lot to get excited about. Maybe it was a breath of fresh air in 2003 when it was released, but more than likely people only recommend it out of nostalgia.  It does play smoothly, and the pacing is nice, with some varied gameplay mechanics. The characters and world are on the verge of being interesting and lovable, but never quite gel. The plot is pretty saturday morning cartoony, and not in a good way.  If you, like me, wanted to check out a game touted as 'an underrated classic', I couldn't blame you for feeling the need to see for yourself. But if you never end up playing it, you didn't miss anything.  5.6/10"
15160,Petz Horsez 2,Totally worth the 5.8GB download! Only thing missing was a better internet connection so I could have played sooner! ...possibly better than Petz Horsez 1?
15170,Heroes of Might & Magic V,"Annoying animations, slow pace, confusing upgrade tree and if you don't know exactly where you are meant to go and when some maps become impossible before you figour out what you're actually meant to be doing.   Heroes 4 is better in every single way then this pile of rubbish (ok, other than not being on steam)."
15190,Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30,  I very very much reccomend this game. It was absulutley amazing it messed with my emotions the whole time. I felt so sad an happy at times and the end is going to force to make 5 more bucks and spend it on the next. It was just i dont even know
1520,DEFCON,"Fun game, hard though.    Good lesson about nuclear warfare, no one wins."
15200,Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific,"The Silent Hunter series is meant to be modded to be fun but sadly crashes too often once mods come into play, especially when you're planning to go through an entire career.."
15210,Silent Hunter III,This is the best warfare submarine simulator out there.
15240,Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific U-Boat Missions,"I do LOVE it, but I'd also like to have the Japanese career and the British career as well, and for Germany I'd like some missions to do, like Americans have got it. Speaking of it, it has a fantastic gameplay mechanic, and the torpedoes, they are awesome! My current favorite class of subs is the Tambor/Gar-class. I as well am editing this review after I reinstalled this, and I haven't played this for MONTHS. I really would like some new freighters and battleships, e.g. Queen Elizabeth-class, Nelson-class, Revenge or Royal Soverign-class, etc."
15270,Cold Fear,cold fear is really good game i love survival horror games its a RE4 clone its creepy and sometimes scare the living crap out of me one thing i hate about this game is the last boss you have to wait and defend the girl plant 4 c4 expolsives after that have to get monster to grab you and do a QTE 3 times your done its stupid i died 10 times i finally beat it well the music is good so i give it a 8/10
1530,Multiwinia,Nice for playing with friends!
15300,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon,"you know when you played a game a lot when you were younger and it seemed really great?   yeah this game is like that but now that im playing it on a modern pc 10+ years later its clunky as hell and enemies instantly aimbot you, meanwhile your troops vary between aimbotting right back or not being able to even outshoot stormtroopers.  i bought this on sale but i rather would have had my 2.50 and my nostalgia intact"
15310,The Settlers: Heritage of Kings,"Great Medieval Strategy Game that still holds up today!  This isn't the first Settlers Game I played, but it did lay a strong foundation for future entries. The Campaign is very strong, it took me over 25 hours to complete, although your milage may vary. I enjoy the build anywhere style this game presents, even though its sequels shy away from this and force you to capture territories. I wish it had better voice actiong, as sometimes it can be downright terrible. Also another minor complaint is the way this game ahndles walls. You cannot build them, but the campaign may give you a town within walls to start, most enemy cities get walls in the 2nd half of the campaign. Walls, however, means almost nothing, gates do not close to prevent enemies from rishing inside, they just act as funnels for units to be gunned down by cannon towers.  All in all, I had a very nitpicks with this game, but it is a very strong entry in the series, and there is a ton of fun to be had with it!"
15320,IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946,I don't know what the other ppl are smoking but this game is crappy as hell maybe it was once good back in the 90's but as for 2014 no way in hell. Thank god I only paid a 1$ to help some sick kids. This game is for old ppl.
15370,Heroes of Might & Magic V: Tribes of the East,-Buy -Install -Grab a friend (probably the most difficult one) -Launch -Multiplayer -Play all day (or night) long
15380,Heroes of Might & Magic V: Hammers of Fate,"After playing, and acutally finishing the campaign of Heroes V, I thought this would be a great expansion with a new faction. I was sorely disapointed. And unless some major changes have been made since playing it, several features that made Heroes V great have been removed, including the tracking bar of how much energy you have to use for necromancy which now makes it difficult to play that faction. Save your time and money and buy Tribes of the East, which has the new Dwarf faction, and a new Orc faction while bringing back the great features from Heroes V."
15390,Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway,"Awesome game, i brought the trilogy. I remember playing this oldie on PS3 like nearly 7 years ago now. Best use with a controller (even though i don't). As keyboard and mouse can be a bit 'jiffy'. Game story is amazing probably one of the best WW2 Shooter (Story) Based games out there even with being nearly 10 years old! Definetly worth the buy.... 7/10"
15400,Harvest: Massive Encounter,  linux version does not work on current ubuntu 16.10
15500,The Wonderful End of the World,"First 15min Impressions: The Wonderful End of the World Verdict: Forgettable Katamari clone.  This is a straight-up Katamari Damacy clone, only you use a mouse and WASD instead of a gamepad.  I loved Katamari Damacy, but I'm thoroughly ambivalent about this game. It gets Katamari's core gameplay loop right, but it misses what makes Katamari Damacy special: - There is no delight in this game. WIthout delight, there's not much reason to play Katamari Damacy. - The level design is really uninspired. In Katamari there was always a way to grow, even if you went into an area that was too big for you. In this game it feels like there is only one way to beat a level. - It might be short. I played through half the visible levels in 15 minutes. Progressing required getting near 100% on all levels.  This might be worth 30-60 min of your time. Afterwards, you won't remember it."
15520,AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity,AaAaAA!!!-- A Reckless Regard for Sanity
15560,AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome,"This expansion for 'A Reckless Disregard for Gravity' (which is one of the best game names ever) adds graphical improvements, gets the game running better on modern systems and adds a bunch of new levels and gameplay improvements. The point of the game is to fly in your futuristic wingsuit as close to the futuristic buildings as possible, while smashing through point-scoring panels, giving thumbs-ups to your fans and flinging middle fingers at protesters. If you can do all that and then land without messily killing yourself, you'll earn 'teeth' that you then use to unlock powerups and new levels. That's all there is to it, pretty much...and it really doesn't need more than that. I nominated this game for the 'Whoooaaaaaaa, Dude!' awared because I guarantee you'll say that the first time you play it."
15620,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II",Not worth at any price. Steam service is horrid anyway.
15710,Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus,My first PS1 game! And it was nice!
15740,Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,This game keeps crashing it just dosnt work dont get this 
15750,Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD,"So after buying this game so many monthes ago, I decided to give it another chance. Now first time around buying this. The game was highly unstable. Very sporadic frames and crashes. Later on it got updated and many (not all) issues were cleared up. This is where I finally gave it a second chance.  Now lemme offer a little bit of backstory. Feel free to skip this paragraph by all means because it will cover nothing of the game itself. So at a much younger age, I was a kid easily fascinated with anything my best friend would bring to the table. Simply put because when your young all there is are the people around you and he was the only person who would ever spend time with me consecutively at least. So growing up we were into many things. Stuff that spanned from the super nintendo all the way to the xbox 360 as time progressed. Yet there were things we skipped out on. Even though we would go on to play the oddworld series, we would never cross over this game. Yet growing up Abe and the other mudokons were so fascinating to me. I could never get enough of them. This game series ended up being some of the fondest memories growing up. I'll never forget Abe nor the monsters that went well out of their way to kill him.   Now back to the review. If you read the above paragraph you would understand that my affection for this gaming franchise runs deep. As a kid growing up this was the game in the series I could never stop looking at with envy. I always wanted to give it a try but at the same time I was wary of it. Because the elements I knew and loved were technically not in play. This was the first or second game to feature not only a new character but full 3D visuals. While this game wasn't setting out to be cutting edge it sure left an impression on me. If you've ever played an oddworld game you would feel immediately at home. It has yet another rich storyline to keep you going. Humor is heavily voiced at many times in this game. I never felt the need to force myself to continue through this game.   It had very easy immersion and a very defined goal with a secret that I couldn't help but rush towards blindly. Unwary of fleeting danger soon to drown my character before I knew what happened. Everything in this game is perfect to me. The stuff that they did add into the game just added to the definition of the game itself. Tell me of another game where your only way to hunt down people with woodland creatures of nature. There is touching up on upgrades throughout the game so that you're never truely cliffed skill wise against your enemies. But that doesn't mean there is a lacking of challenge. There were plenty of times where I was ready to chuck my keyboard out the window. Yet in the end I feel I'm walking away enlightened and at a stronger state of mind thanks to the strong efforts of this team. If you like fast paced action, comedy, and puzzles. Then give this game a try. If I had any artistic capabilities I would eagerly try to match the art style of this game in an attempt to help make cards and emotes for this game because it deserves the publicity once again. This game deserves to have it's story conveyed higher then some titles out on the market these days. This is a heart felt story of a rise from the ashes to avenge the fallen for the sanctity of the mind. This shows that you shouldn't lay down silently while your fellow man falls victim to lies for you might one day find yourself being judged just the same. This game showcases the unity of beings and how small efforts can amount to something far greater. I can't say enough that the meaning behind this game is truely beautiful and I wish that anyone even considering this game or who is reading this that they will give in and try it. Because I feel that they would near instantly fall in love with it the way I did."
15800,Planet Busters,"Planet Busters is an excellent crystal matching puzzle game. The setting, while not entirely unique, does offer the player a wide variety of strategic options. The music in particular is very well done in this title and along with the stage transitions keeps the gameplay moving forward smoothly. The Steam Overlay and widescreen options are supported, so if you are a fan of Bejeweled or Tetris, you will find a lot to like in Planet Busters."
15900,7 Wonders II,"This is a pleasant slider type game. The game is colorful, there are pretty nice bonuses and the music is relaxing.  Get it on some sale if you like slider games. It's not long though. I think there is one secret level, but you would need to have all pieces of the secret map to access it thus your priority should be clearing those colored blocks first.  Be aware though that there is not much replay value once you finish it.  ----------  For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here -  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "
15910,Luxor: Amun Rising,Good little casual match 3 game. 89:100
15920,Luxor 2,why do i have this in my game library i dont even remember buying this   i dont want to associate my self with filthy casuals
15930,Luxor 3,"In the Luxor games you need to shoot coloured balls into a moving line of balls and match balls of the same colour. So that the line of balls don't reach your base. This just isn't as addicted as similar games like Tetris, Bejeweled, Dr Mario or Puzzle League. If you are a puzzle game addict this and need a different game the Luxor games are good, but if you occasionally play puzzle games like that just play one of the great ones."
15960,Little Farm,What the hell did I just buy?
15970,Luxor,The classical match-3 shooter I loved back when it first came out. Definitely helps the nostalgia.
1600,Dangerous Waters,Does anyone have a fix too make dw work on windows 10? 
16000,Discovery! A Seek & Find Adventure,"For a Seek and Find, this one was pretty stoopid. I get the whole be different kind of seek and find, but as a game show just doesn't work for me. Uninstalled and perma banned."
16020,Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena,It's quite buggy. My grandmother is trying to play it but the Gong never appeared and she cannot pick up the padded stick. So she is going to have to start over from scratch. It's old enough now they won't fix it so don't bother.
16030,7 Wonders: The Treasures of Seven,this game made me depressed 10/10
16040,Luxor: Quest for the Afterlife,"All the LUXOR games should allow Windows 7, 8 or later able to play. Only Quest of the After Life, 5th passage and Evolved version can be played in Windows 10."
16060,Samantha Swift and the Golden Touch,"I really liked the first game, Hidden Roses of Athena, so naturally I wanted to play the sequel. Unfortunately, as echoed by other users, this game did not work for me. Steam did not try to resolve the issue and I contacted customer service twice about it and made a post on the community hub. There was no resolution attempt or even acknowledgement on Steam's end, rendering me unable to play this in any capacity. Left with no other option, I had to get a refund. Would be excellent if this game worked for everybody."
1610,Space Empires IV Deluxe,Classic 4X game and with the included mods still one of the best to date (at least in my opinion) Buy it on sale and you can't go wrong!
16100,Virtual Villagers: A New Home,anoyingly fun considering the game is just a bunch of simple sprites moving about a basic map. it is surprisingly in depth and addictive in the pursuit of carrying on the generations of your beloved sprites and remarkbly very few bugs.
16110,Virtual Villagers 2: The Lost Children,"I played this game as a kid with my dad. It's an old one for sure. It's fun, though! It doesn't have a ton of replay value, but the first time through the game, there are puzzles to solve and achievements to get! It's cute and simple, but can be played with any computer, and it's long-lasting!"
16120,Plant Tycoon,"Great time killer, relaxing, and a lot of fun."
16130,Fish Tycoon,"Tedious, time-consuming, but always get drawn back to playing."
16180,Virtual Villagers 3: The Secret City,"Everyone dies too quickly and I find its difficult to really progress without following a very specific formula. Takes micro managing to the extreme, as food sources can completely vanish and leave you with an elder and two children to run the entire village. I remember it being more fun as a child, but possibly because it was only played in five minute increments. The fact that it can't be paused and runs even while closed is another bad point. Leave the game alone for a day, and you come back to a dead village."
16200,Virtual Families,"I remember playing this game when I was young on the PC. It was really fun and nostalgic. Enjoyed it but I found it to be very limited and short lived, yet overall fun."
1630,Disciples II: Rise of the Elves,This is good old strategy classic. I like it.
16300,Everyday Shooter,"The concept is good and the game would be good, but I the controls are not very intuitive. It feels like this was designed for a controller and it would have made a lot more sense to have the wasd for movement and the mouse for shooting"
1640,Disciples II: Gallean's Return,"Maybe it's a good game. Has one of the worse tutorials I ever tried. It told me I had to do X but never explained to me how to do X. So, after hitting every button I possibly could and still couldn't figure out how to do X, i just gave up. Worse tutorial ever."
16450,F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin,"F.E.A.R 2 picked up on where the last one had left off. This game improves the combat, and makes the scares better, leading to a much better experience. The story is much better in this one, as this was not originally supposed to be a tech-demo, lol. F.E.A.R 2 gives you better understanding of the gaming universe that is F.E.A.R and gives you an enjoyable experience with it. The FPS is very smooth and satisfying, and the scares are just as terrifying as before!"
16500,Chaos Theory,"No! This is not a Splinter Cell game. It has nothing do with stealth. It's puzzle game about particles and magnetism.   Your task is to make the particles reach their destination. Red have to end up at red collector and green have to end up in a green collector. That's the logic of the game. The game introduces you new mechanics and teaches how to use tools. The mechanics are based on forces of magnetism. In order to finish the map you have to use properly distributors, rotator, plarity inverters just to mention a few. Timing and thinking ahead is important. Sometimes direction you shoot particles has meaning.   The game doens't feature any rewind/quicksave/checkpoint system, so you have to finish a level in one go. Since this game belongs to the group of trial and error games you will often spend long time repeating levels. Some of them require speed, some timing and some require planning. Later levels combine all of those. Additionally you can't speed up certain actions - you just have to wait... zzz. You are waiting and waiting, and you don't want to carry on. I just don't have patience for it. Let me do it.  The presentation is average. There are very few options. Graphics is basic, so is the sound. On the other end music is pleasant. It's strange, but fits the game perfectly.  The repetitive nature of the game as well as lack of mid-level save system made me quit playing it. I found that too tiresome. Repeating things over and over. Meh... This and the fact I was stuck in a few levels with no clue how to solve them made me quit the game. It's not a bad game, but I guess I lost interest and my patience didn't let me finish. Since I can't really recommend it, so I'm giving it thumbs down. "
16600,Trials 2: Second Edition,"Why have you lied to me, Chris Livingston? This game isn't really fun at all. Maybe for like 2 hours. What the hell!"
16620,Monster Trucks Nitro,"Worst Piece of trash i've ever had on Steam, everything is super glitchy, colors are super bright, and i don't understand why it doesn't want to work properly even after changing so many options, the menu still super blurry (i use Windows 8 but this is the only game that can run but doesn't work properly), i don't recommend wasting time on this, even if it were free, not worth it, it's waste of space, at least i got it for free, Deleted within less than 10 minutes"
16710,Insecticide Part 1,"I can't help but like this game.   Despite being brutally cheesy with its constant puns. Despite having bad/floaty controls. Despite being just a few hours long.....I enjoyed myself.  The game alternates a few times between a 3rd person shooter and a detective point and click style. I think it worked well.   The graphics looked fine, sharp and scaled surprisingly well to my 1440p display. The cut scene graphics and sound were of terrible quality though. I could see the video being bad but even the audio was noticeable worse.    Pros  +Easy (health and ammo are everywhere) +Decent graphics +Decent sound +Voice acting was better than expected +Point and click + 3rd person shooter gameplay +Bought it for 29 cents. +Stable. Never crashed +Smooth fps. It ran at either 33fps or 47fps. Although it always seemed smooth.    Cons  -Very short. I took my time and even then it was only about 3-4 hours max -Can't customize the control layout -Very short distance falls kill you instantly.  -Conversation in game is chatty. Luckily you can skip dialog if needed.   Bottom line  I paid 29 cents for this game…what else needs to be said?! It has a charm to it that made me enjoy it more than I thought I would.   Only buy it for under $1. Not worth it otherwise.    7/10  Good. Above average"
16720,Velvet Assassin,"I like this game, really I do. It sates my desire to play something like it since learning about 'The Boss' in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and wondering what it would be like to play a game like it based in WWII. Unfortunately, I'm not even sure the game will work with the OS it was released to work on initially, even after following all the Community Guides covering the technical problems I've run into. Of these problems include:     Application Crash at launch of the game -- Fixed by Instaling PhysX Legacy Support Drivers    In Game Crash to desktop, often occuring during cutscenes or level changes. -- Supposedly fixed by using Legacy Drivers, yet still happens.    FPS Issues resulting in choppy gameplay. -- Supposedly fixed by modifying graphics settings to disable VSync &amp; Running Windows 7 Compatiblity mode.   Agian I like the game, but with this many problems I can't in good conscience recommend it unless your a troubleshooter with a lot of time on your hands, and only if the game is on sale for less then $5. I'd review more about it but the furthest I've gotten was the second mission, back when I was running 32-Bit Windows 7 Machine."
16730,Legendary,"I've played the game and though it will not be for all of you, I do find it quite fun. totally worth the price i paid for it. "
16810,Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization,"Very bugged; at some point a menu layer will outline your screen and you will need to press CTRL + ALT + DEL to shut game down.  Even when you restart, the same problem will occur until you show mercy to yourself &amp; refund."
1690,Space Empires V,SEIV gets most of the old fans love. I never played it so all I can say is that I have not put in this many hours in game in a long time as I have SEV. Wow.
1700,Arx Fatalis,"This game suuuuuucks so bad! First, you have to realize that this game is a bit old (2002), but that's hardly an excuse for the clunky controls and terribe hit detection. I love old-school games, and I still play games from the early 90's! But this game was just not made well. The goals are unclear, the weapons are stupid-looking, the attack animations are clunky, the combat is boring and repetitive, etc. Just don't bother."
17080,Tribes: Ascend,How can I post a good review if the doesnt even want to launch off the ground. I keep getting 'Stopped working' popup and cant get it fixed.  Thanx HiRez but no thanx.
17100,Children of the Nile,"The concept is nice, I like how the people all interact with each other, and how all the gods are incorporated. However, it's TOO much. You have way too much going on at once, and there's just no way to keep everyone happy (especially with the gods). And once you do get a shrine for all the gods, now it's too far away for everyone and it's a mess. And why build paths when they aren't even used? I love city builders, but this one is terrible."
17120,Children of the Nile: Alexandria,"Avoid, avoid, avoid. I played Children of the Nile for a bit and retired in frustration. I don't mind a complicated, technical game, if I'm having fun at the same time. This game has poor controls, minimal player engagement. It seems mostly like an exercise in bean counting. I was hoping for more of an Age of Empires experience."
17140,Hinterland,"I spent one hour trying to get this game to run with sound, one minute playing it, and one second uninstalling it."
17180,Mosby's Confederacy,"well so far i ve got to say this is a terrific little game. resource management squad level tactics using muskets horses local popular support and a currency based on reputation aquired during missions. maps and starting details ( stats for individual units, number/location of enemies etc)...randomly generated to facilitate greater replayability. the game seems stable enough, runs well on windows 7 (64bit), graphics aren t great but they ll do, game play is easy and intuitive. the music is evocative of the period and overall i d say the game has considerable charm. its also a lot of fun!"
17330,Crysis Warhead,Buggy controls take away from what could have been a fun game. Stick with the original Crysis if you want to have a good time.
17410,Mirror's Edge,"Does not start. Followed every suggestion, could not make it work.  Would like a refund."
17440,Spore: Creepy & Cute Parts Pack,"Maaaaan, this is just like... the best game EVER, I mean it has everything you could possibli want in a game: Variety, Creativity, Innovative Design, Comedy and a Great Story for YOU to tell"
17450,Dragon Age: Origins,"Alright, let me get this out of the way: I love bioware, I love their games, and I desperately find myself wanting to love dragon age. But honestly, while it seems great in theory, in practice the game is just a confusing, incoherent mess that feels like what Xenoblade would be like if you took out all the good worldbuilding, interesting characters and setting, functional crafting systems, and engaging and straightforward gameplay.  If you have the money and wanted to buy this game, I would suggest getting Mass Effect 1 instead. It has about the same graphical quality, but is much more coherent, expansive, fun, and overall has better characters, world, and gameplay."
17460,Mass Effect (2007),cant even play the damn game fails instantly 
17470,Dead Space,"What the hell are those controlls Man I was really hopeing to have a good time with this game, but the controlls are the worst I've encountered so far. It's like everything uses a different mouse sensitivity (running walking aiming) It is very much unplayable imo :( Ragdoll physic's are pretty fun tho"
17480,Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3,"It was one of my Favorit games when i was a kid, and it is still Freggin Fun ^^"
17570,"Pirates, Vikings, & Knights II","Like TF2, but extra team."
17580,Dystopia,"A lost artifact of an advanced race where less 12 year olds played video games and not everything was not about quad feeds, quick scopes no scopes, Just your skill, playstyle, and some expert hacking and combat skills"
17710,Nuclear Dawn,"The game is forgotten and unfinished. It will never becoume a complete product. Full of bugs. Weird RTS concept (spawns are the strongest and cheapest structures). Completely no team balance during the game (some players came, some left and you can play the rest of the 90 minutes game 8 vs 4 player). Bad team balance in the beginning. Not enough good commanders. Not enough players. Very little percentage of good games."
17740,Empires,like skyrim with rts. and guns.
18000,"On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One",Both this game and it's sequil are well written and hillarious. The third is on it's way.
18020,"On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two","An decent RPG with solid, Paper Mario-esque mechanics and the humor of Penny Arcade- if you find them funny."
18040,DeathSpank,Fun action RPG. Lots of interesting quests to do which is nice. All the characters are fully voiced too. Graphics are crisp and works fine with the 360 controller.   Couple things that kind of irritated me was the main characters voice- he sounds like Captain Quark from Ratchet and Clank and while its ok at first by the end of the game i was sick of hearing him speak. Also there is a quest to rescue several children -which is a main story quest- but you cant finish until you do other quests first. Not so bad except the game doesnt tell you this.
18050,DeathSpank: Thongs Of Virtue,"As good as the last one. No wait, better. Because this has bazook'rs."
18070,The Baconing,It has bacon get it!!!
18120,Unstoppable Gorg,I can't recommend this game unfortunately. It has some novel game design ideas and the art style is fantastic 50s classic sifi.  Unfortunately the levels are basically puzzles where you have to figure out exactly what combination of units you are expected to buy and deploy. Stray from the 'correct' formula and the levels are pretty much impossible to win. This takes all the creativity and tactical freedom out of the game which makes it go very boring very fast.
1840,Source Filmmaker,A fun thing to use
18400,Crazy Machines 2,"I'd complain that it's crazy to release a puzzle game where the official solutions don't actually work but then again, what did I expect? It's not called Sensible Machines 2."
18420,Crazy Machines,"This was one of the first games I ever played and I was so happy to see steam had it. Still is a really fun game, still need to look up help every now and again"
18470,Helldorado,"      Score   7 / 10      A truly great strategy game, and i really loved it and highly recommend it if you're into Western."
18480,Mata Hari,"I tried to run this on my laptop (Win 8.1 64 bit Intel GMA 4400 graphics) after I finished Bioshock on that laptop, and it could not get past trying to connect to the DirectX adapter. Installing a 2010 DirectX did not help, and Acer would not offer any more recent certified video driver. Don't try to run this on anything but nVidia."
18500,Defense Grid: The Awakening,This was ment to be a tower defense game. It feels very restrictive and generally isn't fun.
18600,Mayhem Intergalactic,"I remember when this game had a nice small community of active players and an active developer, its a shame that I had to give this a negative review but I feel like this game was abandoned by the developer, I miss this game."
18700,And Yet It Moves,"Overall it is a fun a short little gravity game. The concept was relativly new when it came out so it was kinda like the grandfather of the types of games that are being released out today. The negative review is comming from how poorly priced the game is. Like how quickly I finished the game 2.5 ish hours, $10 dollars is waaaay over priced. Now, when I bought it, it was $0.99 . For that price point it is well worth it. $10, heck no."
18820,Zero Gear,pretty awesome. wish all my friends played
1900,Earth 2160,"its not a bad game, just remember its age,  and i cant believe the amount of whiners saying it needs all your personal details.....it does not, if you read it properly that is entirly optional, just input the cd key.  so with that out the way its not bad, not the best of the genre but for a couple of quid you cant go wrong really."
19000,Silent Hill: Homecoming,Lol @ the people who said the enemies were too difficult.
19020,Puzzle Chronicles, Not for the colorblind
19200,Tank Universal,"Well, it's fine at the first 20-30 minutes...but then it's getting boring. Tron-like world/graphics"
1930,Two Worlds: Epic Edition,"I recommend this game if your feeling gamed out, and if you got $10.00 laying around, its a game you can play any time, its got a interresting story and world, and i feel it has alot of original ideas, hey i put 26.8 hour it to the game in one week so its pretty good, and i finished the game ... with Cheats but you shouldn't need them i just used them to speed things up a little, because i think its a 'grinding' game, and i just wanted to move the story along, if you do get this game your going to get a water spell called resurrection and i recommend you use it when you kill an enemy (you can resurrect as many people as you want to fight for you)"
19320,Space Ark,"So I got this as part of an indie bundle of 8 other games for $1.50, and upon looking at the store page, I became worried.  Barely touched on steam for two and a half years and already had mixed reviews, I approached this game today with caution. The opening was cute. I liked the pop-art style intro. It reminded me of something like Little Big Planet.  Then I saw those things up close. Those...creepy, soulless eyes...begging to die.  Space Ark is basically an Arkanoid game (hooray for puns), where you bounce your Little Big Planet knockoffs around and about hitting objects this game calls 'DNA' and helping these creatures restore there planets to its (un)rightful glory.  I was very skeptical about how this game would be, especially with how the screenshots were kind of a turnoff. But honestly, this game wasn't too bad. In fact it got a little challenging, because not only are you controlling your yoga ball around the stage, but you also have control in navigating your sock puppets that you call 'animals.'  Granted, it's not as challenging as other arkanoid games that you can find here on steam, such as Ionball, but if you like to have color in your environment and like bouncing up and down cute...soulless...evil...creatures, then you'll enjoy this game.  Though at a price tag of $5, I say wait, look for a sale, or look somewhere else. This game is worth no more than your typical dollar app, and shouldn't be priced any higher than that.  Other than that, I (personally) can't recommend this game to anyone I know that is into arkanoid but likes this type of theme.  p.s. This game cannot be played at full screen, so that's another thing to note about."
19500,Eternity's Child,"Sorry, but this is almost unplayable, and definitely unfinished. Do not spend any money on this."
19680,Alice: Madness Returns,I really love the artwork in this game and for the most part the platforming gameplay. The developers have done a great job of the game itself.  But... it really sucks that this game requires that you register and login to another Steam-like UI. I purchase games on Steam because I want to play them within Steam's ecosystem; it is really disappointing that this game goes against the grain and tries to bring along an entirely different system.  Almost everytime I go to run this game the other launcher UI asks me to sign in and I can never remember the password that I came up with for that account and end up not bothering to play it. It is for this reason alone that I cannot recommend the game.
19800,Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood,"Even though this and RTH30 were made around the same time, I feel that, whereas RTH30 has a lot of good ideas but a flawed execution, EiB tightens almost all the faults of its predecessor and hits the mark its aiming for a lot more frequently.   The gameplay itself is more-or-less identical to RTH30, but narratively it does something bold and actively undermines the perspective and heroics of the main character of the first game. In RTH30 you played troubled and occasionally whiney Matt Baker, and in EiB, his friend and occasional squadmate Red Hartsock. We see that Red's perspective of events differs quite strongly from Matt's, and that the character you played before wasn't viewed as quite the hero as the game made you feel. He is seen to be losing his mind and as such Red begins to distrust and even resent him. The dialogue feels a lot less clunky this time round, and the story hits the emotional peaks in a much stronger way. The sound effects are still fantastic and really immerse you in the battlefield, and the voiceover work is of better quality this time round, although there are small but noticable moments of lacking audio that lower your immersion and occasionally undermine the emotion of the moment.   I felt like the level design of this game is superior to the first, and as such, I rarely felt like I was being funnelled into a kill-corridor in which you were damned no matter which path you chose. Searching for flanking routes and thinking outside the box is almost always rewarded, and allows you to feel like you're genuinely outwitting the enemy.   There is the odd AI brainfart, which is at best funny when you shoot an enemy and he stand there like nothing happened, and at worst rage inducing as your teammates move to the outside of cover rather than finding a proper place to hide, but generally speaking the enemy AI is quite strong, and they'll shift and change cover in order to confront a flanking threat.   Tonally the game is as dark as the first, and in its efforts to mimic the real feel of battle, the game is a sombre one. I feel rather harrowed now that it's done, and it makes a small but powerful effort to compliment the player's decision making when you keep your teammates alive. I think this is one of the best and most realistic-feeling WW2 games ever made, whilst also managing that fine balance that allows things to remain fun to play. I highly recommend this game, but you WILL need to have played the first one, in order to understand the story."
19830,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Gold Edition,IMO the best tactical shooter game of its time I havin't played better. I couldn't even imagine how many hours I played this in multiplayer with clan mates (1000's). I just rebought it to have on steam will look for ppl playing still and host servers with my 300/100 fiber connection if possible.
19900,Far Cry 2,Still in the middle of the game. Great game but crashes often so save regularly even after discovering a new save house. Still recommends this game since the crashes are tolerable to me. Depends on you.
19930,The Settlers: Rise of an Empire Gold Edition  ,"New to the Settlers series, very disappointed. This is all the zoom out I get? Be prepared to spend your entire game scrolling around trying to figure out what's going on. UbiSoft's recommendation is to play on the lowest resolution so you get more zoom. really? Even then, it's still barely enough zoom out to see your marketplace and part of the castle. Are all the Settlers games like this?"
19980,Prince of Persia,Really good game but compatibility issues. Wasn't able to play.
20,Team Fortress Classic,Team Fortress Classics age shows in a bad way. How bad? Its completley broken and filled to the brim with exploits. Not only that but the servers are usually completley empty. Just play Team Fortress 2 its a much better game and worth your time.
200010,Quantum Conundrum,"I'd struggle to call the game mediocre.  I feel as if I have seen what the game has to offer after 81 minutes, and it's not engaging. The humor falls flat in its entirety, the puzzles are not those that are mentally testing (as other reviews have stated, pretty much platforming and timing), and the story is uninteresting.  I like to at least have something good to say about games, but nothing comes to mind here. Really, not a thing."
200020,Global Ops: Commando Libya,"Buy this game if you wanna try out putting money on a kickstarter game and when it is made it is crap  omg where do i begin . the graphics? the voice acting? OR THE IMPOSSIBILTY TO CONTROL THE GAME  i will admit it , i enjoyed the game WHEN MY MOUSE WAS ON LIKE 100 DP , then i struggeled to even make my mouse back at normal dp ...  FIx your stuff plz"
200050,Naval War: Arctic Circle,"Not as good as I'd hoped.  Had potential, but never really went anywhere with it. Maybe worthwhile if you really like the genre, are willing to investigate the mods, and/or it's on sale, but I cannot recommend its normal price."
200080,Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge,"Lots of ghosts and good puzzles. However I did not see a shadow at the edge of water as stated in the title. There were several shadows and several bodies of water but the shadows were not directly next to the water edges, although they were pretty close at times."
200130,Puzzler World 2,"If you're a fan of the first Puzzler World, I definitely recommend Puzzler World 2. There are quite a few puzzle types to choose from. Some were less enjoyable than others for me &amp; the colors on the interface can be a bit gaudy, but overall, it is a strong entry in the puzzle genre. It would probably be very difficult if you are not very fluent in English."
200170,Worms Revolution,The ♥♥♥♥ing airstrike has worse aim than a silver ♥♥♥♥ing 1!
200190,Sideway,"Sideway New York is a cleverly conceived and well executed 2.5D platformer about a graffiti Artist getting sucked onto the walls of New York City's urban landscape in a bid to rescue his girlfriend. Using the buildings themselves as the levels you traverse across the walls and roofs of the skyline itself collecting items, abilites, and fighting spray painted enemies along the way.  The level design is incredibly well thought out, because you platforming along the side of a building or roof, which generally have four sides to them, the perspective and orientation of the level is constantly being rotated and flipped as you slip around a corner and switching your axis. This makes the maps very dense and tight, you never get bored going through a level because you'll be attacking it from several directions in very quick succession.   The art direction is perhaps one of my favorite part of the game, a vibrant, bright world of Graffiti and spraypaint pops out from the muted, cool coloured canvas of the urban environment. The character design is eye catching and organic, with its fluid animations further complimented by the smoothness of the camera as it rotates around corners as it follows the character. Everything looks like a urbanised flash cartoon, or Adidas commercial.   The music in the game surprised me a lot. As some one who isn't in any skretch a fan of Hip Hop, I quickly came to love the rythyms and tones they set while I parkoured on the side of a high rise. The soundtrack, which was prepared by SkullCandy (headphone maker) and Hip Hop artist Mr. Lif, is unforunately reused a lot throughout the game, but they're good enough tunes for me too not mind too much. Though I wish the game developers would sell the soundtrack as a whole on itunes.   Subway New York is a great game, an fine example of how a platformer should be made. But it has one GLARING, UNEXCUSABLE FLAW. It has got to be the sloppiest, half hearted console port I've ever seen. It becomes abundently clear this was first made for the Playstation 3 with its terrible default keyboard layout, its jump right in two player coop, its 'do not turn off console' while saving messages, and sometimes refering to a controller instead of a keyboard. This game was made for a joystick and it shows, you'll struggle it make jumps and get inexplicibly killed in the environment, not to mention confuse your keys in the middle of a fight and suffer a cheap death, AGAIN!!   If you grew up playing Super Mario Bros you owe it too yourself to give Sideway a try!   But be sure to use a proper controller!!"
200210,Realm of the Mad God Exalt,just play and don't die
200230,Off-Road Drive,"Im not sure why there is negative feedback on this game. It is pretty much the only game that has the actual feel of 4wd. Its really nice having the option to lock differentials, switch to 4Hi and 4LO. Deflate Tire pressure even! Even using a winch. The only thing its missing to make it more desirable is the option for a free roam, if we could drive through the whole area, ponds, lakes, mud, snow maybe!? This would be 10/10 but I will say its 6/10 for gameplay and 10/10 for having the true 4WD experience. I wish there was more than just racing but I do love all of the true 4WD system options. That is amazing. Oh PS, Im using the Xbox One controller and after looking at the buttons, use RB for modifier. It works amazing!"
200260,Batman: Arkham City GOTY,This game is perfect.It actually does everything right about the batman.The takedowns and putting fear in your enemies is very satisfying not to mention aswell as funny.The conversations between the prisoners are hilarious.the city is big and there are a ton of awesome sidequests and plenty of riddler trophies around.The story is pretty great aswell.even if you finish the game you can still play riddler's challenges and can play as different characters as nightwing and robin aswell.this game will not bore and will keep you interested in the arkham universe for as long as you play.i totally recommend for both batman and non- batman fans.
200370,A Game of Dwarves,"it has some bugs, pathfinding is awfull but great game to spent some hours."
200390,Oil Rush,"The combat is awfully boring and the control mechanics are completely lacking as you can't move units to arbitrary positions in the map, making it impossible to set up defense lines or intercept enemies as they go towards stations behind your units.  Even though the graphics are nice, the story is nonsense and the game quickly becomes boring."
200410,SOL: Exodus,"SOL: Exodus is a simple and repetitive game. All the missions share a general idea...fly around and shoot various enemy ships until something happens. Should be somewhat fun. But the controls, spaceship movement and limited weapons make you feel constantly underpowered and frustrated.   You have three weapons. Machine gun, homing missiles and an energy orb that shoots out the front in a straight line. Only 1 of these weapons is useful and it’s the homing missiles. It’s also the only weapon that requires you to re-dock with the main ship (Atlas) to get more ammo. You also re-dock with the main ship for health.   Graphically, SOL: Exodus was decent! I really didn’t have any issues with how the game looked.   The voice acting is not the greatest. Delivering most lines in an unenthusiastic tone. Plus, the dialog comes one right after the other. Meaning there’s barely any pause between people talking. It sounds very procedural.   There's lots of timer based things in this game. Sit around and wait for something to get scanned, etc. I felt like I was just along for the ride most of the time.   I was forced to cheat and bump up the health of the Atlas and my ship for Mission 4. It just wasn't do-able without it.   The game has a 'checkpoint' system but upon dying...you start the mission all over anyway.     Pros  +Got in a bundle which means I paid very little for it +Graphics are decent. Space looks nice    Cons  +Repetitive +Average voice acting +Spaceship movement isn’t natural and holds no inertia +Only 1 weapon is useful +A lot of missions depend on your main ship's health. (Escort mission style essentially) +Felt underpowered all the time +No checkpoint system even though you see it come up on the screen. Dying = start mission over   3/10  Poor   Bottom Line  SOL: Exodus struggles in several keys areas that really bring down this fairly decent looking game."
200490,Memento Mori,'Memento Mori.'  'Umm... I know that....Games I keep in the hidden category!'
200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"This game is awesome. I've been looking for a good turn-based combat/strategy game for a long time, this is exactly what I was hoping for. I highly recommend it."
200550,Dungeons - The Dark Lord,"if you havent played the 1st dark lord game here is an idea of whats going on here this is how you went really wrong  1. you changed the character creation i CANT CREATE / BUILD MY DUNGEON LORD WHY  2. i really dont like lazy developement or people that cant even come up with there own idea  you took the LOTR story and then you made it bad really bad Maybe you were going for kids little kids, i do understand this is a someone stupid childish game DL1 this one is worse but you made a game that ruined and mocked i would consider LOTR a story and idea that you could never come up with or come close. i was offended playing it  3. everything that was good in the first DL game you took out however you added a little bit of good  wheres the Good???? i cant recall what was good in this game i really cant it was that small of a good  this was a big waste of i dunno 20bucks  i played 4 levels and it was just so stupid i couldnt stand it   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME FOLKS"
200630,Gettysburg: Armored Warfare,Now you might be thinking 'Paradox Interactive'? They did Stellaris! INSTA-BUY.  But I'm going to stop you: this game is terrible.
200670,Disciples III: Resurrection,"I bought it for 3,75 euro and its not worth it. Lots of bugz, leveling of characters is a crap, characters voices is a crap. Cant play on normal level without werewolves. Better buy Disciples II. WIth Disciples II you will love this game, with DIsciples III you will hate it."
200710,Torchlight II,"Brilliantly excels where diablo 3 failed at launch, and at a ridiculously better price range. Graphics are cartunistic rather than realistic, making the game lighter and pleasing. Fun to play alone, but you'll never get the full experience unless you play with 2 or 3 friends."
200900,Cave Story+,"Very fun game. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Got about 80-90% completion, didn't miss much.  Including dying and restarts and such, I finished the game in 6 hours.  17 dollars for 6 hours of video game entertainment is too expensive. While the game is very enjoyable, it should have a cost closer to 10."
200910,Before the Echo,"Great game. The sound was great, if a bit repetitive at times.  Combines DDR with a bit of an RPG."
200940,Sonic CD,"GUYS, DON'T BUY IT! It gives you total rage, and it's so simple layout. I regret I bought this. It doesn't care about what is the right or wrong way, it just continues to hurt your character and give you rage. I haven't tried Tails story yet, but I'm right now SCREAMING in a place that really should be quiet. I recommend Sonic Generations for all Sonic fans instead, that is more logic and better quality  And no, I'm not good at games ;)"
200960,Geneforge 1,"This, and the entire bundle are CRAP and a waste of money. I bought at the discounted price, and even at $5, I feel as though I've just bitten into an apple and found I've eaten half a worm and wanna throw up. DON'T BE STUPID LIKE ME.  RUN AWAY!!!"
200990,Geneforge 3,"I have never written a review on here, but considering this is one of the best games and one of the most underated games ive ever played, ive decided to try my hand at it. Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay.   Pro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.  Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike.   LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.  Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.  Can easily engulf you in for weeks.  Lots and Lots of Text Con's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination   Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.  Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.  Overall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing. Heres to you, Spiderweb Software."
201000,Geneforge 4,"Recommended, good story, challenging battles."
201010,Geneforge 5,whole series is ♥♥♥♥♥
201040,Galcon Legends,A fun concept in a way too short game. Play Galcon Fusion instead and avoid this SP only 15 mission title.
201070,Revelations 2012,this is trash
201210,Pox Nora,"Bugs Bugs and MORE BUGS, This game has a great idea and i can forgive the 1995 command and conquer graphics because this is a fantastic idea for a game.   Play Length - 2 tutorial Missions Reason for play length - My first attempt to play was meet with 30 minutes watching what looked like loading screen for the loading screen, or in I.T. world it was pre checking that all conditions for loading a game were met and when failed it looped. My second attempt to to play this game was met with a tutorial (FANTASTIC I GOT IN THE GAME) first mission awesome it was a little easy for myself but as far as a tutorial goes i understood the game. 2nd mission started and i was playing along until 2nd turn and i got myself stuck by reading what i was doing and following the tutorial i miss clicked and then i could not do anything. These issues are a direct sign that this game should not be played at this stage the tutorial should be tested to as many extremes as possible, this is such a important part of the game it should not be in this condition in any release Alpha, Beta or full the tutorial is what makes the relationship between the player and the game.  Recommendations for gamers - Do not play this game just yet if this review is over 3 months old feel free to make you own choices.  Recommendations for the developer - stop all other work and priorities the tutorial, make the tutorial AI run on local machine (reduces you bot server problems) and make it a story not a this is how you play the relationship built here between player and game is only meant to get worse after this point."
201230,EverQuest II,"Boring, and slow. not worth the download."
201290,Sins of a Solar Empire: Trinity,Steam blows ♥♥♥. I just got it and tried to download sins of a solar empire. It kept sending me the serial code for galtic civ 2. No one to talk to emails did not good. F steam and Im erasing everything I have and having my bank refund my money.
201420,Toki Tori 2+,"I played the game for about 3 hours, solving the same tedious puzzles over and over again until I realized I had no idea why I should care. I kept hoping the game would become fun, but it just never got there for me and I had to stop. I can't see myself going back to it. I can only solve so many bubble frog puzzles, you know?"
201480,Serious Sam: The Random Encounter,",-, idiea was good but ,realization is sooo bad , gamplay is ok,it is like final fantasy , u choose to fight and shoot for 5 sek/u choose swamp and u are selecting another weapon or u choose item and pick item like heal all. U can try to avoid bullets but when u have 3 characters it is impossible. Winning or losing is just lotery u have 50%.Some weapons are useless.  If u remember Serious sam as big badass who smashed hordes of enemy easily then don't buy this."
201490,Airline Tycoon 2,This game is a bit chaotic and doesn't have good progression that draws you in - overall a bit childish.
201510,Flatout 3,Completely misplaces the fun and physics of earlier flatout titles. Game has no structure at all (unlike earlier titles) and track design is uninspired.  Not even worth a buck.
201570,Really Big Sky,"It just exeeds a *little bit* in particles effects. Usually, after defeating a boss, your spaceship accelerates, and then the mess starts. You just can't tell where the hell you are, and why have you died. I don't know, maybe this is because i'm not really into bullet hell games.     Actually, i got this game for free And i just played to get all the trade cards  "
201700,DiRT Showdown,"Wooooow. A 2012 Game that runs without a graphics card on a laptop from the same year? That's not the only miracle here, folks, this game, no matter how you play, is a stunner, and what's more, despite my hidden soft spot for driving games, I'm in love with it. Especially for 99p. To be honest, if I knew what I was in for, I would have paid the full price of £9.99."
201790,Orcs Must Die! 2,"If you've played the first game, you'll be happy to know that the 2nd installment has basically improved upon the first game to perfection. Take on a bunch of new and challenging story levels alone or with a friend, battling through over 20 different monster types with a slew of new traps and weapons, all of which are upgradeable now. As an added bonus, owners of the 1st game will also get to play 10 classic maps, as well as an 'endless' mode to see how many waves you can survive before you run out of rift points. All complaints I had with the first game have been fixed, and the replayability is very high in this title. All I can say is, If you're debating picking this one up or not, you are wrong for doing this, and are merely wasting time you could be spending killing these hilarious, clumsy oafs. Move your axe to the store page, NAO!"
201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,"Un joc frumos , recomand ."
201830,Jurassic Park: The Game,"I died a lot. But I was ok with that. Sometimes the death animations were cool. If your aim is to get gold on every sequence, then you might find it incredibly frustrating, and not fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode. I died a lot and missed a lot of quick time events, but the game was pretty forgiving about it.  I’m playing on OSX 10.8.5 and my controller doesn’t work, at all. There doesn’t seem to be any options to switch to a controller from a keyboard, either. The game runs pretty smoothly most of the time, but occasionally it will just suddenly crash to desktop. One time the game seemed to get kind of confused, and I had to force quit the game.  The shadows look really pixelated, and I have the settings all the way up.  The game is an odd sort of mix of quick time events and simple puzzles. There’s not much of a challenge, and the quick time events can be a little frustrating, but the visuals and the music and the vocals and sound design are all masterfully done.  To me, it’s more of an interactive experience, than a game, and it’s an experience that I enjoyed.  There is one choice that matters and it comes in the last sequence of the game. It doesn't matter much, but it will determine which of 2 endings you receive."
201870,Assassin's Creed Revelations,Really good game no glithces or unfair things appeared in the game enjoyable story and gameplay not lame at all well...maybe in some points but overall a great game looking for some old school ac games buy this one is better than some of the others but requires back story knowlege in order to understand the concept
20200,Galactic Bowling,"Menu screen works fine. The game itself, however, just gives me a black screen."
202070,Choplifter HD,"Best left in the past. There are better 2D helicopter games on Steam. This one is not worth your time. Generally clunky and poor, with controls that hinder."
202130,Impire,"So, lets start with game play. Controls are easy, there is an excellent starting tutorial at the beginning of the game.  The gathering of resources is relatively easy.  Upgrading isn't terribly difficult so long as you're not worrying about some timer count down.  The storyline is amusing, up until the end.   No matter what you do in the game choice wise, ie, the mini missions, it doesn't effect the ending out come. Which is bs in my opinion. Maybe the devs just got bored and couldn't think of alternate ones or were just to lazy to do them.   The dlcs are neat, but you wont get to use them unless you go through a bunch of profile setting changes (after figuring it out) and then getting to almost the end of the game.   There are several points where it looks like you can get rid of oscar in favor of a more compitent advisor thing, but, apparently your all powerful demon is too stupid to figure it out.   Spoiler:  no matter what you do the king always wins. He beats you, makes you kill what ever companion you've been traveling with (oscar or velvet), and you are left there to either rule the basement or go back to hell. The end.   It's honestly a shame the devs didn't put in five more minutes of time to add in alternate companions, ie the fire demon, the undead snake lady, and such. Let alone alternate endings dependent on the choices you've made through out the game.   I give the game a good rating, the creativity with the end and options a non existant rating, even negative. But, if you like the rts dungeon building bit, it is loads of fun. Just don't count on depth of story line or your options doing anything important."
202170,Sleeping Dogs™,Love this!!! Its my all time fav. 11/10
202200,Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition,"There is a cool mod for this that makes it Star Wars vs. Star Trek. I like to cancel out all the Star Wars civs and make it a fun Star Trek: TNG themed turned-based space exploration game. A few years ago online play was still an option, but i'd still get this old gem on sale."
202270,Leviathan: Warships,"WARNING! Game is seemingly abandoned and there are 1 to no players online at any time.   I remember getting this in a humble bundle and playing it for a bit. Now, at that time, since a lot of people got the bundle, there were quite a lot of players, and I have to say - It was fun. It's actually fun strategizing and editing your fleet. But sadly its an abandoned game.   If you have a couple of friends who dont mind jumping in a fun game then go ahead and buy this, otherwise its not that interesting."
202310,Ridge Racer™ Unbounded,"I can not recommend this game, not so much because of the game itself, but because of retaliation of the publisher to negative reviews. What I have to tell is too much information to rewrite all of it here, so I'll just post a link to my review of the publisher(s) to save a LOT of time:   http://www.wondergamer.net/reviews/vindictive_retaliation_to_negative_reviews.htm "
202370,Scarygirl,Not recommending this. You cant even turn resolution up from 1280-1000 wich makes it windowed mode on my tv. Bought for coop play but advise people to buy trine 1-2 and rayman legends over this if you want good 2d platforming games.
202410,Scoregasm,the name says it all
202530,SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4 Episode I,"The game is not terrible, but it has lots of things that bugs me when playing this.(Ex. physics) Overall: Not a bad game to try. But if you're gonna play episode 1, play episode 2 also.(If you're thinking of playing only one episode between two, play episode 2 since that one has more better experience than the episode 1.)  절대 못할 정도로 나쁜 게임은 아니지만 게임 플레이면에서 이래저래 걸리적거리는 부분이 좀 있더군요. 총평: 그럭저럭한 게임. 에피소드가 나눠진 이상, 소닉 4를 제데로 즐기고 싶다면 에피소드 2랑 같이 하는걸 추천."
202670,Nancy Drew: Alibi in Ashes,"Alibi in Ashes is a sad case of a good story and writing hindered by some awful mechanics. This game has so much potential. The writers did a great job with the themes, the characters, and the storyline, but this game is so frustrating for all the wrong reasons. ND games can provide a little frustration in the form of challenging puzzles, but that's not the problem here. The puzzles are great! Heck, I went out of my way to play the mini-game in the ice cream parlor multiple times. Sadly, it's the whole mulitple detectives thing that screws it up. Switching between them and driving around gets really tedious fast. Although I did enjoy the different reactions you get from suspects depending on who is asking the questions. Based on the trailer I thought this game would be fun due to the good old fashioned detective work. Filling in the board and gathering fingerprints looked like fun. Yet, switching the characters around kills it because you constatly have to go through Nancy. The backgrounds are nice, but are undone by the very repetitive soundtrack. Trying to advance really feels like a chore sometimes.   I want to like this game. I want to recommend it, but I can't. I'm neutral. While the story saves it from being an awful game, there are much better ND games out there (like Shadow at the Water's Edge). If you really loved the books, you might like this game due to the hometown setting and familiar characters. If you want to play every ND game, go ahead. But if you're looking for just one fun mystery game, look elsewhere."
202690,Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece,"This game was fun at first but once my empire grew beyond 10 cities, it started crashing every 15 minutes rendering it unplayable."
202710,Demigod,"  This game is old and kind of simple, but I can't stop playing it."
202730,Dynamite Jack,"The basic premise is that you're trying to escape some mines where you were imprisoned. You have to outwit guards, turrets and more, while finding tools like flashlights, bombs and keycards. Multiple challenges per level add to the challenge and longevity. This is a great action puzzle game."
202750,Alan Wake's American Nightmare,"Fun game, I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad, all-in-all, great game!"
202860,Real Warfare 2: Northern Crusades,Can't even play it because in order to press buttons I have to search around until I find it.. Hovering over the buttons doesn't highlight them.. theres some sort of resolution error or something that I can't figure out.
202970,Call of Duty: Black Ops II,"Black Ops II is another entry in the CoD franchise that emphasized a stronger campaign over a multiplayer. And as a story buff, I dig it. At this time, BO2 has around 1050 people playing the multiplayer. This is not a bad base of users for a game this old, who must appreciate it for its haul of maps, and a shift to a point-based loadout system versus a set number of slots. The greater level of customization was a nice breakthrough in a monotonous and largely-unchanged part of the game. The aspects of the multiplayer that deterred me from playing were the spotty connections I experienced to hosts, and the somewhat-common presence of hackers. Aside from that, the game outdid itself with a phenomenal array of guns and attachments. It also contained balanced perk and streak systems, which was obviously enough to keep over a thousand people playing in prime time hours.   While I cannot attest to the game's Zombie component, the fact that over 300 people are playing it at the time of its review signals that it's still a cherished element of the black ops franchise. Maps look accomodating, and would definitely pair well with how awesome the weapons were in this game.   Although I still felt that the multiplayer felt like it was more of the same, the campaign was certainly the strongest feat in the franchise thus far. The black ops developers have found a way to create mind-bending narratives evident in the story, and their first attempt at creating a multi-ending story will have you playing out every possible outcome. While I'll say that that their point-defense side missions were a complete failure in terms of how awkward the system was, it was completely optional and could be missed in the interest of a quicker campaign playthrough. While the game can also feel like a continuation from the original Black Ops, it's not necessary to know it. Unlike its older brother, BO2 excels in mixing the timelines of stuff that was going on around the time of the cold war to their interpretation of the future. Although I enjoyed the actual plots and its unique characters (that really made you feel for both the protagonist and antagonist – a true first in the series), I again found myself wanting more diversity in combat (i.e. stealth sections, and more time in control of vehicles for entire missions).   Because of its offering of Zombies on top of Multiplayer and an expansive campaign, the $30 on-sale value is definitely there. The DLC might only be justified for people who were getting a kick out of zombies. But at that point, the total price of the DLC might be better spent towards an on sale copy of BO3.  "

203210,Titan Attacks,"It's not a bad game, it's just nothing new. I actually enjoyed it, but I enjoy Galaga and all space shooters too. This just doesn't bring enough to the table to justify it's price. There's better, cheaper, more refined classics out there that offer the same and more. It's a great homage to those games, but little else. If you catch it on sale for a buck or so, ok, otherwise save your quarters for that old Centipede machine down at the laundromat, next to the perpetually broken Pepsi machine."

203510,Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone,"It's a tough game, so if you like games that are easy to beat, you should avoid it. However the storyline (at least what I've seen of it so far) is rather cute and enjoyable."
203560,Containment: The Zombie Puzzler,"As a puzzle game, it's just not dynamic or interesting enough. Each puzzle has a fairly obvious solution and there's no real incentive to find any others!?  The 'flying around the city' mechanic is fine but adds nothing to the game other than a delay between puzzles!?  There's the seed of a good idea in here but it's not really bloomed, sadly..."
203650,SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4 Episode II,"Now this is more like it. After the relative dissapointment of Episode I, I didn't even originally bother checking out Episode II. Sonic Colors and Generations were the future of Sonic at the time, why go back to something inferior when those games, and other classics were still a ton of fun? Recently however I decided to get both episodes of Sonic 4 during the Steam Winter Sale. Episode I was still quite meh, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed Episode II! That's to say, I didn't think it was great persay, but it was a solid experience while it lasted. First off, the graphics are MUCH better this time. I didn't realized how plastic-like Episode I looked until I saw the beauty of this one. Some of the environments were quite stunning, not a whole lot of 3D sidescrollers stand out as much graphically like this one did to me. The physics have also improved, essentially gravity and momentum have returned. I thought Tails may be a fairly unnoticable partner as in Sonic 2, but instead he was a big help and a welcome addition! His new maneuvers added and interesting and fun twist to the game! Although I did feel cheap a few times using his flying ability to get out of bottomless pits... The game also adds Red Rings to the levels, though only one per stage. I felt this was a harmless addition, it added a bit of extra challenge but also felt a bit shallow. On the negative side I still don't like how short the game is, or how unoriginal most of the settings are, and I still found the game to not provide much of a challenge. Still this is a perfectly solid Sonic experience. While I hastily recommended Episode I to Sonic fans only, Episode II I feel could be a good introduction to new players. It won't overwhelm them, will charm them with some of it's visuals and set pieces, and provides a simple balance that is easy to adjust to. You won't be missing out on much if you only play this part of Sonic 4, buying both only adds the rather pointless copy and paste Episode Metal. While I still recommend quite a few other Sonic games on Steam before this one, it's worth checking out given the right mindset. This may be the first Sonic game I use to introduce my nieces to the Sonic franchise."
203680,F1 Race Stars,Fun arcade driving game. Many similarities to Mario Kart. I like the way they worked in pit stops with car damage. Absolutely worth the sale price of $3.74.
203750,Binary Domain,What on earth is the problem with theses controls!?!?! Trying to use an xbox one controller and it is impossible. For some reason the mapped aim and fire to the select and start buttons respectively and you cannot change that configuration. Abosolutely ridiculous!

203830,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav,Nice story and puzzles.Love it
203990,SATAZIUS,"Tralfagar, scramble!  Though there really isn't much dialogue or story to the game, the gist of SATAZIUS involves pirate-infested planet Satazius, and assault ship Tralfagar's crew taking immeasurable odds on to wade through fleet after fleet of enemies, and destroy the pirates' base situated there.  The customization of the game is quite interesting. You're granted a Main weapon, which will always fire when the button is held down, and two Sub weapons, which you can switch between, and will fire alongside your main weapon. (The homing orbs in particular are my favorite, possibly because I'm no crack shot when it comes to these sort of games.) In addition, you're given a more powerful Charge weapon, which you can fire off once you've fired with your Main/Sub weapons long enough.  Now, to actual gameplay. On the field, you'll find powerups that augment your currently equipped weapons (however, the Sub weapon powerup will only affect the currently active Sub weapon, so be careful!), speed, score, and a powerup that will generate a shield around you, effectively making you invincible for one shot. Oh, and like most traditional shooters, one shot will mean the end for you. (Alternatively, you can crash into a wall, like me.) However, you're given three more retries, until it's the end. Make those count.  ... Or don't, and finish the game without dying, like the professional shooter veteran that you are.  Alternatively, don't do that either, because even if you're skilled at the genre, it's a pretty brutal game."
204030,Fable - The Lost Chapters,"What the hell Fable! ive played this game for a while its one of my favorites on my original xbox (has been since it came out originally in '05) but now when i go into 'offline mode' IT WONT WORK! and it worked when i first bought it on steam like a month ago but now its not! someone please explain to me what happened to this game, because now it requires an online only play for an rpg meant for offline solo play and my issue is that i dont have access at home for online access so I have to go to a library or some public place to update steam and my games, etc.. on my laptop so what the hell man! I understand Lionhead Studios went outta buisness not too long ago but let me play my game offline with no bs! just my rant but also a heads up for a few people and others experiencing the same issue"

204080,The Showdown Effect,Great game and very fun!
204100,Max Payne 3,"Spoiler alert!  Solid game, Ok story. I am a big fan of the first two games and have to admit that i was a big afraid that Rockstar would kill off the franchise but they have done a good job in retaining Max's haunted washed up cop image and giving it a 21st century makeover without losing the noir. Sure, it feels and looks like any Rockstar game is expected to behave but the elements that made the first two games timeless classics are still there. The flashbacks to New Jersey i totally dig but i lost track of the characters in the game after a while and where the hell is the femme fatale? Bring back Mona Sax :)  The complete version of the game includes all the DLC and the season pass contains most of the DLC in the game. However, the DLC is exclusively for multiplayer i.e. there are no side stories or anything like that for the single player game so if you are not planning on going for multiplayer since the game is quite old, i recommend buying the normal game only since there is quite a price difference (€19.99 for the game, €34.99 for the complete game).  Totally recommended but skip the DLC and the complete version. Single player fun."
204120,LEGO® Harry Potter: Years 5-7,"fun game, that is full chill. doesnt really require a high iq, to complete but some missions are annoying, when u have no idea what to do, and there doesnt come tips.  can recommend for harry potter fans."
204180,Waveform,"Pros: Nice artwork and concept. Cons: Not an easy game for a beginners, irritating most of the time."
204220,Snapshot,"Very early in it felt like a rudimentary physics puzzler, but where the developer couldn't figure out how to have the player move the objects other than by teleporting them. It does some interesting things with it, but not interesting enough. It just didn't grab me in any way."
204240,The Bridge,If you like the Penrose stairs illusion in the lithograph print Relativity of M.C. Escher you will love this game. It is simple to understand how the mechanic of the game work and the chapter progression always add something new as you progress.   The music is very soothing and add to the whole enigma feeling of the game. The sound effects adds tension and a sense of urgency... especially when you hear the sound of those rolling troll heads.   The game mechanic allow you to rewind your actions pretty much like in Braid so mistakes are easily fixed unlike the puzzles themselves which add a lot of reward and felicity when you actually succeed.  Of course you will get stuck more than once and you will have to figure out how this virtual rubix cube works to make it to the end.  8/10
204300,Awesomenauts,I play this game only because I hate myself...and looking at my hours on this monstrosity I have a lot of self-loathing going on.

204390,Pineapple Smash Crew ,"I am not sure why this game has so many positive reviews. It doesn't quite feel finished. It is highly repetive and does not seem to have much variety. The moment to moment gameplay consistes of an isometric view squad based shooter, where you can pick up usable items, such as grenades, shields, health, and other, and you go around randomly generated levels shooting stuff and avoiding having your squad members killed. You can buy heads and thing but so far I haven't seen any items you can purchase upgrades for.   As of right now this feels like a beta, not a finished product."
204440,Pickers,great game
204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger,"Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is a great game. Go buy it!   Not convinced yet? Stick along, I'll promise to keep it short :)  In a time where wild west games are a dime a dozen, this one takes the cake.  You take on the role of a bounty hunter named Silas Greaves (voiced by John Sygan), a very likable character. On his quest you'll meet tons of historical old west figures, like Billy the Kid for instance. He tells his story and you play it.  Though not all portrayed historically accurate, the game gives its own twist to it which makes it refreshing, though sometimes this can lead to some odd happenings. You'll know what I mean when you get there. For the most part the story is pretty good.  The voiceacting is pretty good. Silas definitely takes the cake, but some of the side characters are pretty memorable, too.  Levels are linear, which is a bit of a downside. There are some instakill sections and invisible walls aswell. There are collectibles in each level that tell the real story of the old west though I found these are pretty much copy pastes from Wikipedia.  The graphics are very nice and despite that the game runs well on lower end systems. They went with a very stylized look which I love. The cutscene work is awesome for the most part, though near the end it seems they are much less detailed. The outdoor areas and skyboxes look stunning.  The game/gunplay is your typical FPS, with regenerating health and quicktime events. The guns don't sound all that meaty and lots of the weapons have animation errors, but this is a minor problem. The gameplay overall is very fluid.  The game consists of episodes, with each episode ending in a bossfight. This can either be a duel or a regular 'tanky boss in arena' fight. Both have their problems and you will probably die a lot fighting the bosses on your first run, which kinda sucks.  Overall the game is short, around 6-7 hours, but for the price you get enough bang for your buck. Besides the story you also have a duels mode in which you can duel all the bosses from the game. Next to that there is also the arcade mode, in which you have to score as many points as possible. Both the duels and arcade will yield a few good hours of fun.  The soundtrack is awesome. it has this western metal theme and it when playing under the action it fits right in.  That wraps up my review for Call of Juarez: Gunslinger. I can recommend this game to both western and FPS fans. Go buy it, you won't regret it!"
204530,Infested Planet,"Infested Planet is simply great for its price and what it tries (and succeeds) to do with its peculiar type of genre. A strategy game at heart, but a few moments can make it seem close to a puzzle game. If you are no fan of puzzle games, fret not, for it is not too simliar to the genre.    Your role is a commander over a series of squads that (usually) meet a grisly demise. You are to guide them into battles, taking over alien hives. As the campaign proceeds, you gain new tech and the enemy gets new mutations. I recommend this to any strategy fan who enjoys the Starship Trooper movies."
204560,Confrontation,"I enjoyed the tablet top game and bought this outside of steam with no predertermind mindset. Played for 6 hours offline. In short, it's a clunky unoptimised convoluted mess and the company went into liquidation after this was released so there is no hope for it being refined to something midly entertaining."
204580,Rotastic,"Very funny game, recommend :D"
204630,Retro City Rampage™ DX,"It's 2D GTA with some hit-and-miss retro humor, and I LOVE IT. If it's $3 on sale, definitely worth it! $10--still worth it! Best thing is: you buy the game once, and that's it ;) Remeber those days?"
204760,Deep Black : Reloaded,"I took a ♥♥♥♥ one time.       At least the ♥♥♥♥ didn't crash. I recommend you buy this game for one reason and one reason only, that reason is simple... to test the new steam refund policy. This should be called crashing simulator honestly, it'd be a hell of a lot me entertaining to play."
204840,Babel Rising,You get to kill arrogant blasphemers and destroy their stupid tower. ya it's awesome.
204860,Men of War: Condemned Heroes,"Compare to men of war AS 2 , the game interface is not good , I like you can right click your mouse in men of war AS 2 to move your squad and use left mouse button to select or disselect squad but you cant do that in condemned heroes, you have to use left button to select squard first and left button again to move or fire .  But the game is interesting and still fun to play , fast pace gameplay , behind enemy line and knock out German tanks , SPGs, anti tank guns , anti tank grenade is powerful ."
204880,Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion,I have played the series and this game so i suggest this game if u like realtime strategy or team strategy.
204940,Crusader Kings Complete,"The original grand strategy game that I can't get anywhere in, Crusader Kings is a....well, grand strategy game, but unlike other games in which you take the helm of a nation, you sit in the big-boy (or big-girl) chair of a noble family in the era of the crusaders, this being medieval times, that is.  Plot murders, sire children, eff your neighbors out of provinces, get effed by their bigger, better neighbors who like them more than you, and get back stabbed by a baron for not paying him enough attention. A deep learning curve is involved in mastering the politics and management of both a family and a burgeoning empire.  However, the game has no over all 'goal,' so it is up to you to decide a win condition. In one game I played as a minor noble in Holland, and through a series of events that not even I understand, I ended up as king of France. Not dying and ending up as a king seemed like a 'win' to me, even if, if memory serves, we ended up being invaded and facing rebellions such that France was destroyed anyway.  For: people who love deep simulations, politics, game of thrones, and haplessly watching the Holy Roman Empire eff you for fighting someone inside the empire.  Not for: people who don't like deep simulation, sensitive to the idea of murdering an idiot son that's going to inherit over a more qualified son, impatient people."

20510,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky,I love this game. Apart from some crashes and the weak ending... But during the game everything is fine... If you don't try to respond to every distress call or keep the depot XD I played it the second time with the 'complete-mod' what makes it even more awesome.
205100,Dishonored,"Pretty cool game, don't really know how the story works in with Bioshock: Infinite, but it's still fun."
205230,Hell Yeah!,"This looks like a really fun game! Though I own it, I couldn't tell you if it's fun for certain, though. You see, it won't work for me. Random owners of Hell Yeah are saying, Heck no! Read through the community discussions before you decide to spend any money on this game; you'll see that there are many unsolved threads which begin similar to, 'game won't load.' It might be prudent to 'borrow a copy from a friend,' before making a purchase. If you CAN play it, please let me know how it feels..."
205270,3DMark 11,"3DMark's benchmarking algorithms are off and most people know how to game them to get waaaay higher scores than is even possible. People running dual core Intel Celeron processors beat out AMD FX 6+ core processors. Likewise people with integrated graphics beat out discrete GTX cards by miles.   If the scores were meaningful, benchmarking software like this would be useful. But it's not and therefore, I can't recommend it."

205650,The Testament of Sherlock Holmes,"A true puzzle-solving game masterpiece. It's quite obvious this game is mimicked after the one true Sherlock Holmes - the late Jeremy Brett. The game stays true to the actual tv series from the 1980-1990's.  This game reminds me of the Sierra games of old, like Space Quest and King's Quest."

205730,Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet,"  I want to like this game. Dear God I want to. I love spooky creepy tentacle beasts, I love seeing interesting visual styles, I love this exact look and feel in a game. The concept is good - a tiny alien trying to save his planet from shadowy beasts that have taken it over. The Metroidvania aspect is fun. The visuals are just gorgeous and the music is quite well done as well. I don't think I've ever seen an ice level use lasers as a gimmick before, that's unique. I got it for free as part of a gifted Humble Bundle some time ago, which included some of my now favorite games like Eldritch and the charming Mutant Blobs Attack.  The problem is, the game does not work. I don't mean the visuals don't work well together, or that its themes aren't cohesive - they do, and they are. I mean it literally doesn't work. The controls, no matter how you set the mouse, are too sensitive for this type of game, making movement feel too slow and aiming feel too quick - especially with the arm and the rockets. The mouse sensitivity control settings goes from sluggish and unable to move the mouse at all, to WAY too fast and slippery to handle. The UFO feels sluggish as hell to lug around. The controls just never feel quite right even though they are standard WASD controls with a mouse. The game feels like it's trying to be too many things at once - Metroidvania homage, shooter, puzzle platformer, exploration - and not a single piece of it is done well. These are things that play well together, developers, and have for decades of gaming now, so why are you having so much trouble making them work?  Puzzles are both too simple, and unneccessarily frustrating - some of them even feel like a chore, and a good puzzle should not feel that way. Some give hints that are too vague, and the solution is just one thing. No free reign with the tools you get. Some bosses do not seem to explain or give good enough tells for what you need to do - one involved clinging to a suctioning vortex creature, the hint given for defeating it? A weapon you don't even have yet, and if you're not paying attention to those anemone things, you won't realize their spikes are heat-seeking missiles. Some hidden objects are easy to find, and some hidden objects are stupidly hard to find. Others use unique ways for the tools you need to make an extra leap to discover, but you probably won't realize you can do it until you backtrack and mull it over deeply. Developers, there is a difference between 'Make the player think about how they can use their tools' versus 'Make the player scrape the bottom of the barrel of thoughts trying to determine if they CAN do something with a tool'. Castlevania understood this. Metroid understood this. Nintendo Hard does not mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard, and trust me, I know hard versus fake hard - I grew up in the puzzle game haven of the 90's and have played my fair share of games with tough puzzles. I should not have to look up a walkthrough to figure out what you intend me to do because I thought I missed something and broke the game.  The game is unpolished, and full of glitches that range from funny to game-breaking. I have a high tolerance for a certain kind of glitch if it makes me laugh. There's an amusing one with the sea cucumber things and the vents in Ocean, involving one of the flattened ones flipping about as the broken physics went awry. It was amusing for all of five seconds until I realized the game shouldn't be doing this. I got halfway through the game when I hit a snag in the Ice world - the laser beam physics were wonky enough on one puzzle that the beam was hitting a bit below where it should and not reflecting. Confused, I looked up a walkthrough, and sure enough this shouldn't be a thing that happens. Then I noticed I missed a spot that required rockets to get through, go to bomb it... and nothing. Every other object of same type nearby reacts to the rockets, except for the one I need to react. Once again, I check a walkthrough to confirm... and this shouldn't happen. So I can't go forward because of one glitch, and I can't go down because of another. Was there no quality assurance here, guys? How did something this game-breaking slip through the cracks? And this is not the only problem the Ice world has, apparently this is just the point the game decides it likes to break, which is a problem since it's the halfway mark of the game.  Combat is brutal. Too brutal. Again, Developers, there is a difference between Nintendo Hard and Too Hard. This is almost too hard. Enemies respawn *way* too quickly for this sort of game. Swarms of tiny enemies are a huge chore to deal with. Fighting does not feel fun with the finicky controls for the arm weapons. The shield power is nearly useless in battle. Too many enemies with ranged attacks in close quarters when you're trying to solve a puzzle that respawn within five seconds. None of this is Nintendo Hard, it's just unfair. Even Eldritch and other roguelikes let you have a longer reprieve between enemies spawning and respawning. Even Dark Souls is not that cruel. I appeciate you're trying to make this a homage to Nintendo Hard, guys, but this is not how you do it. This is artificial difficulty for the sake of trying to be tough to psyche players out.  Did I mention the physics in this game are broken? The physics are broken. Putting objects where they belong for puzzles is tougher than it should be. Physics for throwing objects are not cohesive, in that there's no momentum. Things don't feel like they have weight if they are supposed to be heavy. I feel like I am waving around a dead fish trying to control the arm, and the less said about the inability to control the rockets in the guided section, the better. This is a physics puzzle Metroidvania throwback with broken physics. Why would you make this style of game if you can't even get the physics down pat?  Like I said, I want to like this game. I really do. But I cannot forgive a game that has been out since 2011 having controls this finicky, glitches this game-breaking in such quick succession to each other, and this level of artificial difficulty. There's no excuse for a game to be released this unpolished, and with so much potential too. There is a reason this is mostly overlooked despite its apparently good reputation here. The artwork just does not save this one, it's too broken. Also, Games for Windows Live? Ew, guys. Just ew.  Don't buy this game. Save the money, and go buy the excellent Nihilumbra or the kitschy-fun Mutant Blobs Attack. They're not Metroidvanias, sure, but they are beautiful, polished, and fun - something this game fails 2 out of 3 at."
205810,Jagged Alliance: Crossfire,Achievements are broke as f¥ck!
205830,Luxor Evolved,"In the Luxor games you need to shoot coloured balls into a moving line of balls and match balls of the same colour. So that the line of balls don't reach your base. This just isn't as addicted as similar games like Tetris, Bejeweled, Dr Mario or Puzzle League. If you are a puzzle game addict this and need a different game the Luxor games are good, but if you occasionally play puzzle games like that just play one of the great ones."
205840,Yesterday,A little 'janky' here and there animation wise but the bonkers story kept me playing!
205870,Auditorium,"This style of gameplay is not really my cup of tea, but that's why I didn't particularly like this game. It's because it didn't quite live up to my expectations with regards to the 'puzzle' and 'music' parts of the game. I found the controls and menu layout to be a little wonky; I was slightly lost. The 'puzzle' portion, due to the loose mechanics of the game, feels more like a game of trial and error and tweaking rather than something enjoyable. This is made a tad worse by the wonky controls. The most 'musical' it gets is...mixing instruments together, except that you  have  to mix  all  of the instruments together each time — there's no choice. If you really want something musical, go play a game like Circuits instead.  Edit: I just realized I should be a bit more positive about this game after getting a bit further in it. The music is indeed spectacular: mostly piano and strings, but a nice orchestral feel.  Edit 2: OK I just dug into the game's samples and found out why the loops aren't perfect (thus ruining the immersion factor somewhat): they use MP3 format, which is terrible for looping because it adds silences on the edges of the sound sample. Even if the MP3s are well-calibrated sample-for-sample, the silences still don't make the loops as smooth as they should be. The devs probably should've used OGG or WAV format instead. (As an aside, you can find parts for three unused songs in the game's files.)"
205890,Chronicle: RuneScape Legends,"Its awsome,fun and relaxing to play. Dont be fool and give it a try. Its free And you dont need to spend money to advance. ^^"
205950,Jet Set Radio,"Classic extremely challenging platforming. Can be frustrating by today's standards, but it's fun if you don't take it too seriously."
205990,Warlock 2: the Exiled,"The game scales poorly, you can run into things in the beginning of the game that can kill you, if you survive long enough you can have an easy time in the midgame, but, at least in Exiled mode, you get to the end game and the power scaling goes completely off the rails. Can't recommend this."
206020,Avernum 4,So the best comparison i can make to this game would be the ultima 6 &amp; 7. It's very old school and it does not hold your hand.   PROS  - Great Story - Cool World - Interesting Characters - Actual Depth   CONS  - Learning Curve - Battle Mechanics (Sometimes) - 5 AC To Attack   8/10 
206040,Avernum 5,"I love the saga, the storytelling is fantastic and the atmosphere fascinating. The hints to the next chapter are nice and the characters pretty well structured as usual, However this episode loses an important ingredient, which made Avernum a game so beloved by its fans: the sensation of free roaming. Normally it's the player deciding in which direction going and how to proceed the story, which has several main plots. This time instead the player is obliged to follow a single path, made by consecutive areas until the final one. The torment difficulty is praticable until a certain point, which I don't reveal to avoid spoiling, but then you are practically forced to switch to a lower difficulty not to be trapped in the middle of the game. In any case a must of those who followed the full epopea, but in my opinion the worst chapter so far."
206060,Avernum 6,The good : in some way interesting quests and fight management.  The bad : good old time graphics.  The good : it take only 99 Mo disk space so you can forget it when you're bored by the graphics. I removed it anyway.

206250,ClaDun x2,"An old school RPG with new features, Cladun X2 brings a definite retro feel in gaming. While using the tried and true method of more action-oriented RPGs (such as Secret of Mana), Cladun X2 allows you to use other created characters to bolster HP, defense, attack, or even experience gains. The ability to redraw characters faces, hair, armor and weapons gives and characters you make a personal feel, and each class offered has a unique draw. The downside is the story, leaving much to be desired. It starts well, the premise and plot not only flow well, but the characters feel unique in their own way . The major problem was I could not find one character or conversation that felt engaging in the slightest. I won't even mention the online features considering I couldn't find anyone else using it. Overall, the gameplay is fun, but don't come looking for a mind blowing story."
206370,Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack,"It's a short game but I had fun with this cheeky little platformer. Even if you die, the game has very generous checkpoints so you respawn right where you were."
206410,Crazy Machines Elements,"Idiots made this crap! There is no obvious way to rotate, which is what is required for the plank placed used under the ball. With out rotating, the ball stays where it begins and you fail."

206760,Painkiller: Recurring Evil,"I feel I need to tell people about this game. It is SO bad. all the Painkiller games are the same thing over and over again. It surprises me that they can continue making these games and throwing them in our faces. Every monster has the same amount of health. Every weapon does the same amount of damage. The objective is to kill every monster before moving to the next area. That is all the game is. I purchased the bundle of 6 games for $80 and i feel i was grossly overcharged. After having purchased the game I feel like I should be an executive at Nordic Games and have my way with the company. Seriously ANY executive decision would be the correct thing to do. The games they are making could not possibly be any more bland, repetitive or boring. What a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Take it away ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Man. 'That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t' dingaling a lingaling a ling a ling"

207020,Bang Bang Racing,"Hidden gem!    I put this on my wishlist a while back because it reminded me of the old (really old) R.C. Pro Am game. When the Steam sales rolled around again, I thought I should give it a try. Well, i'm glad I did! This is just pure gaming fun, people.    There are so many games today, and most are just trash or gimmicky. They rarely meet your expectations. This game is one of the few that is actually about just having good fun while playing a game - you know, what games were intended to be all along!    This is easily worth it's full price, if not double. The F1-style cars were a pleasant surprise too. The graphics are great. The tracks are designed well. And the cars are also great."
207040,Sine Mora,"This is a game that I want to love, but just has so many little things that make it less than fun. By no means is this a ugly game it's pretty in all the right places and oozes a diesel punk charm that alone is worth giving it some well deserved praise. There's alot here that's visually appealling, but sadly game play wise it is less so. So let's start out with the good shall we?  Pros: -Great art style that shows how much the artists really cared about presentation -Interesting time-based game play (a bit confusing at first, but not bad) -Well done voice work, Furries that don't sound like a kids cartoon and convey emotion pretty well  Cons: -It can be damn near impossible to tell what can actually damage you. Foreground, background who knows? A lot of times you're going to take hits and instantly question what actually hit you. -If I die to an enviromental hazard, ok cool, but if after dying 3 times less than 10 seconds after a check point and I'm still questioning how am I dying there's a problem. In the factory stay with the floating trash, trust me I just saved you a bunch of unneeded frustration. -The shot precision is a bit excessive, like you need to be on EXACTLY the same horizontal plane excessive. -Movement feels really slick on a Xbox controller and on an arcade stick, I didn't bother to use a keyboard. This isn't a game killer. Honestly I could eventually get used to it, but added on top of the other stuff I don't want to bother. -The game wants to be edgy and shift the bullet-hell formula around, but forgot what makes those games fun.  To sum up this game is like my Ex-wife beautiful to look at, but other than that she'll just frustrate you, annoy you and take your money. I'm going to revisit this game a few more times and hope it grows on me, but for now unless you really can look past the funky design choices I'd say pass this this one by."
207080,Indie Game: The Movie,"Why does this even exist? A bunch of no-names who aren't good enough to work for real video game companies made no money on their crappy games and went broke so they made this garbage? Does the phrase 'Small name, big ego' mean anything to them? I don't know how this even got into my library, but I ran it once on mute just to leave this review. If you idiots want to be real video game programmers, try making a game that doesn't suck so much that Nintendo rejects your game for not being good enough instead of wasting time on your 'movie'/fundraiser."
20710,Mr. Robot,"An attempt at putting Puzzle Platforming and Traditional RPG gameplay into the same experience. The RPG sections play out as expected and work fine. The Puzzle Platforming, on the other hand, do not. Using an Xbox 360 controller, the player character and movable objects slip and slide haphazardly. Movable blocks seem like they're supposed to lock into the squares of the playfield, but do not more than half the time. Trying these sections with keyboard and mouse feel even worse."

207320,Ys: The Oath in Felghana,"This game is just epic. Great soundtrack, the playthrough is a unique experience. It's a must have to everyone who likes realtime fast paced Jrpg."
207350,Ys Origin,The Y’s series is old now and there is really no reason for anyone to purchase and play this game. The mechanics are outdated. This game is does not hold up. The mechanics are just outdated. Don’t be fooled by the reviews of people who talk about this like it is a classic. This is for people who think civilization peeked with the beastie boys and the ultimate warrior.   You might like this game if: You were trapped in ice for 20 years and this is the first game you played. 
207370,eXceed - Gun Bullet Children,"Unlike eXceed 2nd, which I recommend, or eXceed 3rd, which is one of my favorite games of all, I think this first game is absolutely terrible. Allow me to explain why:  1. The menue and options are terrible. Instead of picking a difficulty, you're automatically set to 'easy' unless you change it in options. The game is forced full screen in an extremely low resolution, making it look like absolute ♥♥♥♥ on my 1080p monitor and making it hard to see what exactly the hitbox is since the screen is so 'fuzzy'.  2. The difficulty is all over the place. While, on easy, some things don't fire at all, there are some bigger enemies that fire a huge stream of bullets at you as if it's a later level in medium difficulty, or the first level on hard. Same goes for medium. Even more so: the patterns that are way too hard for the difficulty almost seem identical to that pattern on a lower level. I think this is because of the exceptionally small (and hard to see because of the glare) hitbox. The first boss had this exceptionally high difficulty in every 'spell card' or 'pattern'  3. It lacks variation. Just look up the first boss fight and you'll see that this fight, which takes 4 minutes, only has 3 patterns. The pattern on their own are very short so having them for such a long time only makes it more boring. The game goes for the levels. Especially the second level, which basically has two patterns: the one on the 2nd picture and the one on the 3rd picture (which is by the way easy difficulty, to strenghten point 2). All bullets being red doesn't help against the feeling that you lack variation.  4. Audio quality is horrible. The music is mediocre compared to the other two games, but the big offenders are the voice actors. The voices sound forced and they sound like a sub-128 kbps MP3, distracting you from the game and throw off your groove (if you had any. see point 3). The voice actors didn't seem to know how a microphone works either. You hear the voices wave around as if the voice actor is still looking for the sweet spot distance from the microphone.  5. The burst that you also have in the 3rd game is absolutely out of place. Pressing the shooting button after releasing it? Really? There are more than enough keys on the keyboard, why assign them to the same? I wasted basically all my bursts after I wanted to start shooting after a small time of nothing happening (which makes the game look elongated and see point 3)  6. It's wasted potential. The controls are tight, which only makes matters worse: 'the core is there, but the producers did jack all to turn an engine into a game'.   7. All of the points I've given strenghten eachother. If point 1, 2 or 3 was fixed, the game was a lot better since that would also fix many issues in the two remaining points.  This is honestly the least enjoyable bullet hell that wasn't a browser flash game that I ever played. If you want a steam bullet hell, go for either of the successors, preferably 3.  "
207380,eXceed 2nd - Vampire REX,"I haven't played eXceed 2 that much, but I can already tell it's a HUGE improvement compared to its predecessor. It's in english, runs at a solid 61 FPS without patches or compatibility fixes, and basically every other aspect of the game is good.  The music is pretty good. Characters are drawn much better, and the in-game graphics and models are way better as well. What surprised me the most tho, is how great the gameplay feels. It has the same polarity mechanic as Ikaruga, and it plays surprisingly smooth. The danmaku patterns are much more intuitive, you can immediately understand what you're supposed to do. Doing that, however, is another thing: the game's extremely hard even at normal difficulty, but it gives you generous amounts of lives and continues. Also, the stages are short so you'll be constantly learning the patterns you have to follow, instead of replaying the stages a million times. Don't sweat it if you die a lot; deaths in this game are not as big of a deal as in, say, Touhou. I also have to mention that the stages are short, so is this game. You can beat it in about one hour if you skip all dialogues.  I didn't like the fact that you can't stack bombs. You are limited to ONE at a time, because it's based on your bullet-sucking bar. But other than that, this is a solid game with standard shmup gameplay."
207400,eXceed 3rd - Jade Penetrate Black Package,Great soundtrack. Satisfying combat. Cute characters. Packages.
207420,Wizorb,Really enjoyed it. Quite the cheap casual gem.
207430,"Hack, Slash, Loot","I feel bad writing a negative review for this, since in some way the art style is a bit endearing, but this game is just incredibly boring and relies too much on infuriating RNG."
207490,Rayman Origins,"This feels quite slow and punishing and therefore frustrating to me. Rayman's slow speed means  getting through a short level feels like forever, and this is doubled down with insta-skills whenever you touch an enemy or fall off the screen. I like taking risks and experimenting, and this game needlessly punishes those 'I wonder if...' leaps of faith, which is really not fun for me."
207530,Noitu Love 2 Devolution,what the ♥♥♥♥ is this game
207570,English Country Tune,"Buy only if you're die hard puzzle game fan. Not very interesting for a casual puzzler like me. Would be something I'd play with my mobile device, but not wasting time on desktop."
207650,A Virus Named TOM,"I...didn't like this game. Which is weird because I love the hacking minigames that many stealth/bioshock games have. But this one doesn't feel like it has a difficulty curve. Sometimes they're stupid easy. Sometimes it feels impossible. And there's no rhyme or reason to what you're going to get from level to level. I loved the art and the story, which made me sad that I didn't like the gameplay itself. I'm not sure what type of user would like this game, perhaps if you really liked Frogger back in the day and have a better attention to detail than I."
207670,AVSEQ,★★½ Either i seem to be connecting random colors and nodes together without any certainty of what i'm doing or i do know what i'm doing but not sure if i want to.
207690,Botanicula,Didn't play much because just felt boring.

208030,Moon Breakers,"Coulda shoulda woulda.  Just let it rot, unfortunately."
208110,Myst V,"Strongly disappointing finish to perhaps the greatest franchise in PC gaming. The Myst story swan dives over the shark with the Bahro from Uru, shoehorning a class warfare storyline that should have stayed in The Book of D'ni where it came from, and where it applied to D'ni's long lost twin civilization.  Puzzles are simple in the Uru tradition, with clues located fairly near to where they're needed. Other puzzles require stumbling through controls until you work out what it wanted you to do in the first place. Still others require reading Yeesha's whiny journals to find the symbol they want you to draw.  The drawing mechanic is just fine. Utterly out of place in a Myst game, but it's no worse than the godawful horns on Haven in Myst 4.  Pick it up to finish the story, or let the story have ended at Revelation, you decide."
208140,ENDLESS™ Space - Definitive Edition,I got this game years ago played it for days on end loved it then for a long time stoped playing it for some unkown reason then when i started again i fell back in love this game is so awesome even 3 years after i got it i love it after spending time on endless space 2 i still love it ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game and purge the galaxy of all non humans in the name of the Sheryden fleet.
20820,Shatter,"Let's just be straight: Half of the reason you're gonna want to buy this game is because of the amazing OST. Module is an amazing musician and he needs all the recognition he can get. Other than that, it's basically Breakout with physics. A cool concept with a lot of mileage, and it works a lot! However, it can get a little tiring when so many things fly at you and make you risk losing a ball because of some dodgy physics. It's good fun, but a little monotone after a while."
208200,DOOM 3: BFG Edition,"Talk about a game that stands the test of time. Still gorgeous, doesn't feel like a traditional Doom game, but damn the hype for this game 15 years ago was sick. Still really fun."
208400,Avernum: Escape From the Pit,"Countless hours can be sunk into this game. Classic old school RPG epic, teeming with nooks and crannies to sink your teeth into.  Between cheats, difficulty adjustment, balance, and a straight up character editor, there's no way this game will be ultimately too hard for you to beat. Lots of reading though. That could be good or bad depending on your view point. The writing is great."
208460,Tryst,"Why the ♥♥♥♥ did I buy this, what was 15 year old me thinking..."
208480,Assassin's Creed® III,"Don't bother with 'deluxe edition', 'season pass', etc - the content won't be available and steam will do nothing about it - if you happen to play more than 2 hours of the game, refund won't be an option regardless of the fact that you cannot play all that you paid for."
208500,F1 2012,"This is perhaps the best racing game I have ever played. When I did bother to play it online with others, it was fairly easy to find racers and get some laps in. However I enjoy the single player aspects of it having found the scalable AI a sufficient and fair challenge. The various career and quick race modes plus the ability to do time trials and take on a variety of challenge events makes this a well-rounded product that has great graphics and sound, and a very approachable driving model."
208520,Omerta - City of Gangsters,"ok so first off the game is not perfect. No game is, thats just how it goes. The combat is frustrating for the wrong reasons, the economy is decent but not very deep, and the story telling is good at somepoints and passable at others. However none of the aspects of this game should be considered bad but rather not as good as it could be. The combat is in my opinion to worst part of the game and even then it is better than some games ive had the misfortune to play. The combat can be clunky and slow and the AI can be downright stupid at times, welcome to turn based strategy combat systems, they tend to be this way, the combat does get better asthe game goes on and new weapons and characters are available to you but it never really becomes your favorite part of the game. The economy is better, in my expierience the economy is by no means a deep system. It does not get effected by your actions in the story, it does not change much at all with the exception of a few missions and buildings. However the game seams to encourage you to expiriment with the economy, it is fun to make it a goal to sqeeze as much out of each part of the city you visit, change up what you have in an area as you go through the mission in order to increase profits, decrease your heat and change with number of independent businesses slowly decreasing ad the number of friendly faces going away as they are used up. In one city run a fear based bussiness in the form of protection rackets, pawnshops and gunnrunners. In another work with the populace in the form of a soupkitchen and speakeasy setup. My point is expirement with it. The game gives you a limited number of slots to build with inn each different map, find a wa to make it fun and take everything you can from each place you visit.Finally there is the story. It not the best mafia story out their but lets be honest when was the last good mafia story since the godfather movies. The story has its ups and downs butit does not make or break the game. In my opinion it beats mafia three on its repetitive nature and story. In any case i would say that if you are looking for a game that can be enjoyable and give a slightly realistic powertrip youve come to the right place. just dont look for the best and you should be satisfied. Just a quick end note, If you can, get the gae on sale with DLC. Its the best way to do it."
208580,STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™,If your a fan of rpg and amazing stories you wont go wrong with this game.
208600,Lunar Flight,easily one of the worst games i've played
208620,Midnight Mysteries: Salem Witch Trials,This mystery games suffers from some lack of direction. Most of these are great in the Midnight Mystery series but this one has parts that lead to nothing. Scripted events that take place at certain locations means sometimes wandering all over to find that next event to randomly occur so you can proceed. It is not a mystery that can be solved when these are random events instead of puzzles its just wandering around aimlessly.  Rating: 2/10 Value: $0.99
208630,Midnight Mysteries 3: Devil on the Mississippi,Sound: 8 Graphics: 8 Story: 8 Gameplay: 8.5 Commands: 9 Keep the gamer playing: 8.5 DLCs / Expansions: - Time to load / lag: 9 Bugs / Problems: 9.5  Final Score: 8.5
208640,Midnight Mysteries 4: Haunted Houdini,Very enjoyable game.... Loved the graphics and animated backgrounds...Story takes a bit of getting into but once you know the backgeound of whats going on its enjoyable...... This is my first HOG in years...Played the game and all the extras took my time as you can see and managed 13 hours of fun. Long time but took ages on the bonus stage haha
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Enjoyed this one a lot. I was worried about the performance (I have have a middle-of-the-line laptop), but it ran perfectly well on medium. Occasional slowdown when it was raining in game, but I could have fixed that by turning off the advanced rain feature.  If you've played any arkham games, then you know if you'll like the game or not. The main new feature is the Batmobile, which I enjoyed. It may be a tad overused, but it's insanely fun to go barreling around the city, taking out walls and other cars.  The one complaint that I really have with the game is that it's a tad too long. It's fun for its entire length, but it took me 50 hours to 100%. Part of it is that there are 243 riddler items, which I think is really too many. It gets very tiring to fly around the city solving riddles that become somewhat same-y after the first 120.  Overall, I give it a 8.5ish out of 10."
208670,Blades of Time,"The gameplay seems to be alright, but the story, dialogue and acting is beyond terrible. This is from a russian developer and it's very evident things were lost in translation. The music is generic and uninsteresting, and there is no way to restart a level at an earlier checkpoint."
208710,Colour Bind,Fun with gravity.
208730,Game of Thrones ,More faithful to the books than Season 5
208750,Apotheon,"I've barely played this game, but what of it I did play was really fun, great mechanics and pretty good story."
20900,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"the fight against the 'burning beast' ist the dumbest 'Boss-Fight' in gaming history! Running in circles,gettin locked by a cursed Dog all the time, endless spawns of dogs around you. If the Witch aside stands up after years, she cast a healing spell on me, i cant move, stand still near the burning ring and catch fire and die. The cut-scene to this fight is not skipable - you have to watch it over and over again!!! Problems to start the game? To skip the intro at the beginning of the game you have to press 'escape', sometimes there´s no cursor - press and hold 'shift' to be able to see the cursor - then start the game.Save your game frequently - many freezes. Its horrible! I tried to play the witcher from the start to dive into these universe - a big mistake!!!"
209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Keyboard controls steadily worse as the franchise goes on. Can't move the map with your mouse, have to use WASD. Absolute pain in the ♥♥♥♥."
209060,Drunken Robot Pornography,I really wanted to enjoy this game but I just cant. I might have actually enjoyed the game if there was a way to disable the timer but there isn't. I Found the experience more frustrating than fun as a whole. Enemies seem to just spawn all around you and staying alive was challanging enough then having a time limit on top of that just became an nuisance.
209080,Guns of Icarus Online,"The spire stands firing its light artillery guns greased for performance. The junker, hull armor down, smashed by the barrage quickly succumbs to the fire.   Finished, the spire turns to met it's new foe. An enemy galleon lumbers by, tanking the first volley without flinching, the captain grabs his lucky phoenix claw and yanks on the wheel while the engineers frantically repair the hull and guns. The gunner unleashes a deadly broadside of fire from the hydra cannons, making short work of the spire.  But what's this? a speedy goldfish with an optimum weapon loadout creeps out of the fog, guns blazing. The captain yells his gunner to let loose with his supercharged guns as the galleon's armor buckles. The galleon fires a salvo, but the goldfish speeds forward, ramming into the galleon and finishing the job. The captain spins the wheel, balloons spent of hydrogen and engines damaged, the goldfish shrinks back into the fog while the engineers nurse its wounds.  There, I tried to make this cool. I like this game. play it. good community (but there's always a few downers) but its a pretty small one. also had a few disonnects even with good wifi. Anyway, thumbs up for tis steampunk team based sky battle game."
209100,Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City,"If they patched the living hell out of this, Removed gfwl and price dropped then yes...yes you may experiance a great lf4 type clone but since it dose not look like it...im sorry just dont put yourself though the pain!. im sorry res bros"
209120,Street Fighter X Tekken,Please play this epic game with me =[ there is literally nobody ever online
209160,Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Multiplayer sucks, matchmaking sucks Everytime I join a game, I never get any smooth game If not a massive server lag, I get lag spikes all over the place Don't buy this game, it's a waste of money, horrible, worst call of duty ever 1/10"
209190,Stealth Bastard Deluxe,"Delivers exactly what it promises! A taxing, yet completely fair pixelly stealth-em-up. Tons of levels, each with a hidden collectible and an achievable S-Rank, with hidden levels unlocked by collecting both.   8 worlds, 8 normal levels in each, with the two aformentioned-secret levels bringing it up to 10 per world, with each world introducing a new gameplay gimmick - be it a new enemy to avoid, or a new type of environment (floors which emit noise, motion sensors, etc).  Some levels are frustrating, some levels seem far too easy, and some are incredibly fun. Altogether, a great gem of a game.  &lt;b&gt;Pros:&lt;/b&gt; Great gameplay - very tight controls, and a good learning curve. Great music - although there are not many tracks, the ones that exist are pumpin'. Great writing - a dry wit delivers a rough narrative between stages.  &lt;b&gt;Cons:&lt;/b&gt; Some levels near the end of many of the worlds feel tacked on - almost as if the dev couldn't come up with 8 fresh ideas for each world. Sometimes the checkpoint system feels a little unfair, particularly in a couple of the later levels, forcing you to replay difficult (or even worse, slow) chunks of the levels multiple times.  On an abritrary 10 point system, I'd give it a 7 or 8."
20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"The game is good although not as good as the first,the graphics are very nice the story is great,I liked the combat, the leveling, quests but it just didnt feel that good as the first,the negative is that the story was pretty short. i think it deserves a 8/10"
209230,Sherlock Holmes and The Hound of The Baskervilles,"I just can't quite recommend this one. The supernatural story is an affront to Holmesian reason, the voice actors are poorly cast, and the visuals are often of poor quality. Moreover, the hidden object scenes are roughshod and the puzzles range from dirt simple to frustratingly unintuitive. There are certainly some redeeming qualities here and there - an excellent map, for example - but the overall experience is just a little sub-par."
209270,Hero Academy,Pretty lame that you have to pay almost 4 times the game cost to get all of the playable teams. Seems like a slimy way to get more money out of this simple game. Challenges are kind of fun. Not sure it's worth the 5 or more bucks to play.
209330,A Valley Without Wind,"This may very well be the best platformer since Super Metroid. It has a nonlinear plot, an infinite number of worlds, a complex magic system, and dynamic enemies. Highly recommended to anyone who likes platformers, and retrogamers in particular."
209360,AZMD! Scorepocalypse ,"Fun, fast-paced, zombie grinder. A few bugs. Original had a story. This one does not. Level Capped at 15."
209370,Analogue: A Hate Story,"This is one of those games that's about talking to imaginary girls but it's not really a game, it's more like a choose your own adventure, but you're not really talking to imaginary girls, you're talking to imaginary imaginary girls because they're computer programs within a computer program within a computer program and they're representations of girls who actually existed inside the game so it's weird and Korean and kind of confusing. Even more confusing because I think it was written by a white canadian girl but whatever.  But there's this interesting thing going on in that it explores what would happen if a multi-generational space voyage had something catastrophic happen and all memories and culture from the civilization who launched the ship in the first place were more or less erased and subsequent generations had to deal with a reversion to primitive/more openly patriarchal cultural structures. It's surprisingly interesting, but I almost always have a problem with the interface on these 'visual novels' and this one is no exception. It's a minor quibble and I knew what I was getting into with this so I'm not really going to fault it for that.  That said, it's not ♥♥♥♥ing around when it calls itself a visual novel. It's almost entirely comprised of reading text and occasionally running commands on a dos-like interface, so if that ain't your thing, breeze on by."
209390,Dungeonbowl Knockout Edition,"When people still played this game, it wasn't bad. It was a fun experience. However, since this is a  MULTIPLAYER ONLY GAME , only in a blue corn moon will you find somebody else to play with. I cannot recommend a dead game, no matter how good or fun it was.  They eventually added sorta-singleplayer, but it's just not the same as the other games in the series. Instead look for Blood Bowl or something else similar. This game just isn't worth your time or money.   DO NOT BUY THIS!"
209520,Mini Motor Racing EVO,"Game concept is nice. Graphics and sound are very good. Controls are playable. However, the gameplay isn't nice.  The computer controlled opponents get advantage by bumping at the player's car, and they do it frequently. The player cannot do the same because it seems that the computer almost always get the upper hand during collisions.  I manage to finish first only when I lead all the race and don't let any opponent get close enough to crash into me. Therefore, I found the races either annoying or chaotic.  Sorry but I can't recommend the game."
209540,Strike Suit Zero,Great indie game and space shooter. Bought during steam sale at 75% off definitely worth it! Soundtrack reminds me of battlestar galactica and the battles are epic as well. Immersive game. Also there is a bit of Mecha thrown in which is okay with me since I am an anime fan. Minor technical problems such as game sometimes plays windowed and had steam crash a few times. Don't let those issues stop you from playing an otherwise great indie game!
209610,Roller Coaster Rampage,"Don't. Just, don't. ^_^"
209630,Magrunner: Dark Pulse,"So it's magnetic puzzles with Cthulhu, basically. Normally you'd expect magnetic fields to attract fields of opposite polarity, but not here - here opposites repel, it seems. I guess that when we're talking about alien horrors that drive you insane, this is what we mean now.  All things said and done, though, this is a competently executed puzzle game. I'm not great at puzzle games and I got stuck a few times, and some of the puzzles rely less on planning and more on timing than I'd like, but overall I found the difficulty fitting for a casual puzzle player. The story is fine overall, though some of the voice acting is a bit wooden, and the ending is actually kind of interesting, though it also features some fashionable criticism of social media that feels unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the game. Cthulhu likes to sit on the edge of certain maps and growl his name at you over and over again, which is cool the first time but quickly gets kinda weird. Seriously, Cthulhu, we get it. Calm down.  Overall, a decent game though not really outstanding by any measure. Give it a shot if you like first-person puzzle games!"
209650,Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,"I really want to recommend this game and tell you to purchase it. The storyline isn't amazing but it's better than Ghost by far and it showcases some pretty awesome sci-fi gadgets. The voice acting is top notch. The multiplayer could use some balancing of weapons but there's nothing that a few balance patches couldn't fix...  At the moment, there's a lack of dedicated servers and severe lag/framedrop issues on the PC; Particularly for AMD users. This often makes the multiplayer portion of the game almost completely unplayable, especially on certain maps. Some maps also take an unusual time to load even with RAM/CPU way above the requirements listed. This includes certain single player maps for the main storyline.   If these issues can be fixed, then I can fully recommend this game and judging from the other reviews, it looks like a lot of people feel the same."
209670,Cortex Command,This is one spicy meme 12/10 would nuke myself again
209690,Fieldrunners,Mobile game. Big noup - despite getting it for free.
209730,RAW - Realms of Ancient War,"it reminds me of diablo, just more basic and more linier ...but still fun"
209750,Cannon Fodder 3,"The original Cannon Fodder, was one of the first games I played, I loved it! So seeing that a third one was up for grabs, I went for it... It is NOTHING like the first 2 and was extremely dissapointing. RIP Cannon Fodder."
209790,Splice,Reminds me of my time spent in microbiology: an abundance of cells doing strange and puzzling things
209830,Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut,"I have to respect this game's particular pixel art style, but in terms of what it's trying to accomplish, I find that it fails.  I haven't read any reviews or interviews with the creator, but I got an incredibly huge feeling that it was inspired by Silent Hill. It's so much of an hommage that it looks like more than that, it's almost as if it was intended totally as a new Silent Hill. The psychological horror, the look of the monsters, the lack of lighting, a main character that is hiding something, all of it and even an area that was previously normal looking suddenly turning nightmarish.  It works artistically and I have to say it's a huge thing to accomplish to have a truly scary looking environment in a 2D pixel art game. But the way it plays, I had no sense of stress, of being scared, of not knowing what was hiding from me.  The fights are too simple in that the enemies are simply moving towards you and you just press the shooting key and hope to have enough bullets. Aiming is usually not necessary and if you stock up on bullets, it's just pressing the shooting key when you see an enemy with no strategy implied. The enemies' strategy is mostly always just moving towards you, as simple as that.  If you play the stealth way, it's a matter of having enough rotten meat with you and placing it at the beginning of a section where you can hide in the background and get on your enemies' left or right while they're busy eating, but there's not enough of figuring out how to get past those sections. In the end, the strategy is having enough bullets or enough meat on you, at least in my experience.  I would then guess this game relies on the psychological element and the atmosphere, but without the feeling of stress, no matter how you achieve it, the way a Silent Hll type game is specifically designed will never feel like true horror in my opinion. Which is a shame, because I loved the concept of Silent Hill as the series was even better than Resident Evil for me (true uncomfortable horror compared to jump scares).  This game seems to be made by a talented person and there is a lot of good to be said about what it feels like outside of how it plays. I would have to see a similar game with better mechanics, it could be a very good replacement to Silent Hill if this game was improved upon. I certainly don't expect to play a real Silen Hill any time soon anyway."
209850,Highborn,"Its not a bad game, but after some maps it kinda gets boring. Maybe if the maps were smallers it could keep interesting, but I couldnt justify to myself to keep playing this game after the map with the dragon. overall, would give a 60"
209870,Blacklight: Retribution,"The game is largely based on a pay to win and you will be at an disadvantage in the beginning. Beware of BS items like the machete, revolver, and exploding throwing knife. If you are willing to spend $20 to get you started, great game."
209950,Triple Town,It's a great game to begin with but building up coins can be very frustrating. Compared to the free mobile version. You can buy coins if you're desperate for coins. But with this full version. Building up coins is very limiting. Especially if you bought this version.   My advice for the developers is to implement each successful combination from 3x Grass to 3x Shrubs and the coins doubles up. If you combine 3 grass that upgrades to a shrub. You get 3 coins. If you get 3 shrubs and it combines it into a tree. The coins doubles. That's how the game is supposed to be for this full version. As the current coins income is very little and very long.  In my opinion I don't feel that the developers had adjusted this full version features. Which needs to be balanced.
2100,Dark Messiah of Might & Magic Single Player,"I hadn't played any of the Might &amp; Magic games prior to playing Dark Messiah and, in fact, had never heard about it until I came across a picture of Xana somewhere on the internet and, fueled by my short-sighted, knuckle-dragging masculine urges, wanted to find out where she was from. I found out about Dark Messiah, played the demo, and upon completing it, immediately wanted to buy it.  The first thing that I, as pretty much everyone else, will praise the game for is it's combat. The combat system is simple enough, but incredibly fine-tuned and responsive so that you feel like you have complete control over how you fight. Because of this, deaths rarely feel like they're anything but your own fault. Whether you didn't block on time or enough, didn't keep your distance, or missed the key window to unleash your power attack, most of the time I found that I died because of either poor decisions in the midst of a fight or my own lack of skill. That aside, the combat is incredibly satisfying and I never found myself bored or aggravated save for a few choice moments, which I'll go over further down.  I found the story to be fairly predictable, but engaging enough that you at least are motivated to see what happens next. The characters don't have much depth to them, save for your companion, Xana, who provides a coquettish and flirty personality that makes your long treks through spider-infested tunnels and orc camps feel more worthwhile. That's because, practically from the moment you meet her, she's quite clearly obsessed with your character, often going out of her way to tease or flatter him. She also will provide a few tips and try to help throughout the game, and while some of them may seem obvious, she can sometimes point out something that you totally overlook on your own. Without spoiling anything, the reason she acts in such a way becomes more clear later in the game. What's also great about her is that she's an incorporeal companion, so you don't have to worry about her getting in the way during gameplay.  The only point that I found truly frustrating or difficult about the game is a certain enemy that you begin to encounter later on in the game, in which a healthy dose of artificial difficulty combined with every fight involving no less than at least 3 of the little ♥♥♥♥♥ makes you start to dread hearing their raspy, heavy breathing. The orcs, which you fight for the majority of the second act of the game, can become rather annoying as well with repetitive dialogue and the fact that where they are found, they seem to be absolutely everywhere, so that you rarely get any time to stop and take a breather. Spiders and Zombies don't provide much of a challenge, but for God's sake ALWAYS KEEP AT LEAST ONE ANTIDOTE IN YOUR INVENTORY. I made the mistake of using my last antidote to cure my poison before I cleared the spider's tunnels and found myself poisoned for at least 2 hours straight, as I was unable to find another antidote for some time. Also, invest in your poison resistance skill very early on. It'll save you much headache later down the line.  All in all, Dark Messiah's shining example of First Person Melee Combat done right is easily it's primary strength, followed closely by the most charming companion character I've found in a game. The solid RPG mechanics backing up the gameplay allow for you to pick and choose how to go about combat, also providing some strong reply value. Some enemies can become frustrating, but with perseverence and patience, it's really not that bad. I'll likely find myself coming back for another playthrough later on."
21010,Watchmen: The End Is Nigh,It shows the story of Rorschach and Nite Owl before the Watchmen comic. Awesome
210170,Spirits,The wind is unpredicable in this game. Change the position by 1mm and the spirits will behave totally differently. And all of them won't react the same way !
210230,Nancy Drew: Tomb of the Lost Queen,6/10
210490,Fray,"Fray has an outstanding amount of bugs, glitches and crashes. This game was definitely not ready for release, and I would not even consider it ready for beta testing, yet here it is. It lacks simple UI and social features that one would expect within a modern game of this type (friends list, private matches, matchmaking) and its 'co-op' listing is entirely PvP. They also require you to use a secondary login system in order to play, and registering at their site tells you the game is still in Alpha and that you should receive a second key soon. Unfortunately this is both true and false. The game IS very much in alpha state but they are not providing second copies of the game. I do not advise buying it, though I do hope it can recover from it's pre-mature release and bounce back with some enjoyable gameplay. Someday. But it has been over a week now and there is little word on how they plan to resolve this.  Purchase Frozen Synapse instead."
210550,Angry Birds Space,"I love playing this game in my living room, taking turns with my younger brother using a wireless mouse (its all you really need to play the game). 10/10 family fun"
210770,Sanctum 2,"It's a fun game. But it doesn't remain fun for long.  After a while, it feels like it's just the same thing over and over. No character advancement or anything. Similar enemies, similar strategies.  Wait for a discount!"
21090,F.E.A.R.,"Don't buy this game expecting it to be of a horror genre. It is more like a shooter with horror aspects. This game is extremely innovative for a 2005 game. They figured out a perfect way to use the atmosphere to scare you more than Paxton or Alma. Going through air vents and dark tunnels, you instinctively pull out a shotgun, waiting for something to appear, even if it doesn't. The shooter aspect is great too. It introduces 'reflexes', which allow you to slow time and have a more controlled line of fire. You could go on about the positives of this game, but there are some negatives. The DLC 'Extraction Point' isn't updated to run well on modern machines like the base game and Perseus Mandate have. It requires you to change the resolution in the game files. The frame rate drops contantly too. But for $2.49 on the steam sale for the game and both DLC, it's a must buy."
210950,Rune Classic,"You can eat lizards, drink excesssive amounts of alchohol, and decapitate zombies with severed limbs. What's not to like?"
210970,The Witness,Great game but would recommend waiting for a sale to buy it.
21100,F.E.A.R. 3,"Hey guys, let's make a tense shooter about scary ♥♥♥♥, but forget about that scary ♥♥♥♥ about halfway through the game.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOjelqtWpR0&amp;index=53&amp;list=PLYkTBSuzozCRmWovr0gMsVFUKAo1s94JK   To be fair, there are some good jumpscares and the atmosphere is nice. Furthermore, there are some GREAT shootouts and good AI in the game as well. It's really meant more for co-op, but plays just fine single player as well. Haven't tried the online components, but the single player campaign is pretty damn fun."
211010,Alien Shooter 2 Conscription,"I think that the game started pretty cool!  I was really enjoying it, even though its not the pretties one around. The controls are also basic and the its pretty much a mindless game where you just kill everything that moves.  You have tons of weapons and lots of armor choices and, as I said before, I was having a good time with the game. Wasn't really minding how ugly and brainless it was...  UNTIL THE ESCORT MISSION!  Omigawd really? This mission kills the game. It totally makes you angry and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you'll forget any cool times you had playing it.  I won't recommend it. Even though I had a good time 'till that mission, I believe that this is not the kind of game I'd recommend."
211050,Battle vs Chess,Dreadful interpretation of chess. Better of on  chess.com  or just getting a checkered board. Waste of money at any price  Edit 25/11/16:  This game is still awful and the above statement holds true. Voted for 'Worst interpretation of an existing game' award 2016.
211070,Check vs. Mate,"I WANT MY $3.79 back. also, How in the ♥♥♥♥ DO YOU EXPECT THE CHAOS CAMPAIGN TO BE POSSIBLE WITH THE A.I THE BOTS HAVE AND YOU HAVE TO CHECKMATE THE KING?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!! ON THE FIRST LEVEL!??!?! DUMB THEM A BIT, RE ADD THE UNDO THING, OR GIVE M E MY MONEY BACK AND TAKE THIS AWAY!"
211160,Viking: Battle for Asgard,"Only buy it cheap, but there's a fair bit of fun to be had here. It's uninspired but solid, and sometimes that's OK in a video game."
211180,Unmechanical,"This is such an excellent game. The graphics are lovely, the gameplay never gets tedious, and i love the controls/physics. It reminds me a lot of Portal, which is extremely high praise.  The only issue i have is the lack of direction. Some form of speech or even text to explain whats going on, whats just been unlocked etc would make this game a perfect 10/10. But there are some parts where it is confusing as to what you're actually supposed to be doing,"
211260,They Bleed Pixels,"They Bleed Pixels is a very difficult platformer with mediocre combat and no charm to its name.  I really think that's the problem I have with TBP - a lack of charm. The enemies are shapeless black blobs. Combat is simply not fun. All the levels are completely empty except for platforms, enemies, and spikes. I don't know if just one person made this game, but it definitely feels that way.   I think that I, personally, have reached a point in my life where I need some fluff with my crunch - some reason to keep playing a game beyond a testosterone-driven desire to win for the sake of winning. They Bleed Pixels offers nothing but additional soulless, empty levels as a reward for your constant deaths.  This may not be the case for you, and if so, godspeed, you horrible human being."

21130,LEGO® Harry Potter: Years 1-4,"It's a pretty glitchy mess, but I'm still trying to 100% it. If you can find the solutions to the bugs as I did, you should be able to enjoy it for the most part. 7/10."
211340,Magical Diary: Horse Hall,"Honestly I expected a lot more. I hate to write bad reviews but in truth this game really did disappoint me. I got it for half off, have been waiting for it to go lower for awhile, but out of excitement spent the money on it anyways. In my view it's not worth even that much money.  I love visual novels. I feel if you pay more for them though, and the art isn't that good, the choices better be. In this one, the choices seem to be more meh. The paths clearly set for the most part. The addition of picking your classes and the test are just added in as a ooo you get something more to do, but in truth they just get in the ways in my eyes. Especially during replays.   As for the replays themselves . . . I haven't completed my second. I find myself sitting here thinking I would like to play a good visual novel, I'm sure I have one hidden in the list of games I still need to play. Yet, with this wish to play one and knowing I still have replays to do on this current game I keep pushing it aside as if it is more trouble than it's worth to open it back up.   This is mostly my opinion though, and where I can't really say oh the art should be better, because I bought it knowing how the art looked. I can say I am disappointed in the game over all. Where are the feels? This game's publisher has produced other good games, and I expect to be able to play many more. Over all I suppose it wasn't a bad game, it just wasn't the game for me."
211360,Offspring Fling!,"It's great and cute fun, but if you care to 100% the game you should bring your best plattform and execution skills to the table! This games time trials are extremly hard to beat and it's more about percise plattforming than puzzle solving in the first place"
211400,Deadlight,"Pro: + graphics + atmosphere + sound  Con: - frustrating gameplay (I had to repeat and repeat the same scene up to 30 times) - keyboard controls are not balanced (I died sometimes because of bad controls) - after game restart, the savepoint may be behind the savepoint of the last gamerun (I had to repeat a scene) - savepoints are not displayed - infrequently savepoints (again: I had to repeat a scene) - only 5 hours to play  I bought this game on sale. For the general price, I cannot recommend it."
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"If you can't fix it off a video you are stuffed they put no effort into it, its the Xbox version they didnt even need to change the on screen buttons and add any settings or umm maybe remove the FPS cap I know I can mod it and I have but it won't work, when I uncap the FPS it just wont launch so GJ good port"

211500,RaceRoom Racing Experience ,An 18-wheeler can make sharper turns than these cars
211580,Wanderlust: Rebirth,"Wanderlust: rebirth has everything gamers want in action rpg. Challenging gameplay with many moves to smite your opponents to smitherine while you grind for hours to get better at the game and win some epic loot in the process. The action in the game is well balanced and the variety of things to do makes the game more than a simple hack and slash video game but there are a few flaws to this unknown gem; The screens in which you battle feels too small at time and having areas you can't acess simply because the game was not designed to let you go there, be it because of a tree or simply because the space can't be walked over makes it frustrating sometimes. The fact that some of the moves from the ennemies will kill you instantly or leave you powerless to defend against is infuriating. And the abuse of colors that will turn you blind after a few days of playing this game non-stop... seriously I don't recomend playing more than 2 hours every day.  But despite those flaws Wanderlust: Rebirth is a pretty sweet game and the online co-op is simply awesome.  7/10"
211600,Thief Gold,"This game is too old to be considered fun in 2013. It's hard to know what to do, and what items do what. The map is terrible and the controls are clunky. I spent 10 minutes just trying to get a head shot on a guy so that he wouldn't scream and alert everyone. Not fun."
211740,Thief 2,"This shadow-based stealth game builds on everything its predecessor began.  To start, I'd like to say that this game is the masterpiece of its series and is a must-buy if you are even somewhat interested in the stealth genre. Almost everything about this game is perfect.  You play as thief, god-killer, absolute legend Garrett and try to get to the bottom of the schemes of Karras, a shady figure who really likes steampunk and selling robots and cameras to ♥♥♥♥ing everyone. As a sneaky boy who likes to hit fleshy people with blackjacks, these robots and cameras will present a large problem to you. Funnily enough, if you beat the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of a robot with your blackjack for long enough, it will break, but it is easier to incapacitate them first with one of your water arrows (which are in limited supply) to their engines.  Level design is fantastic, better than the first game's. Each level is nonlinear and massive in size. The enemy AI is good, and does not fall apart when they start to look for Garrett (unlike this game's predecessor in which they simply moved toward Garrett while they looked for him). Just like the last game, you have an arsenal of gadgets at your disposal that allow for unparalleled creativity in how you can approach an objective, including the iconic rope arrow (which allows for tons of creativity just on its own). Enemies are diverse and challenging, and the levels often require you to find hidden areas or encourage you to find secrets. Sword combat returns almost unchanged, which is good for the most part, but the abusability of overhead swings on human targets is the only flaw I can find with this game.  One of the greatest stealth games of all time: 10/10"
211780,Conflict Desert Storm,"Conflict: Desert Storm was one of my favorite games for PS2 as a kid, and within the first few minutes of playing, the nostolgia was already there. I was a little annoyed when I discovered that my Xbox 360 controller doesn't work with the game, but the mouse/keyboard controls are surprisingly not bad, with only a few clunky bindings. The game doesn't feel near as difficult as it was when I was a kid, even when I play on hard. I recall having a tough time even on easy difficulty back on the PS2 version. The most difficult part about both versions is the tank combat. Engaging with a tank is fairly tricky, due to the fact that tanks are really well armored on the front and sides. Tanks are really only exposed in the rear, which is explained in the heavy weapons training session. When I used to play this game and heard a tank rolling nearby, I would litterally sh*t myself because of how accurate and deadly they were. After confronting a few tanks in the new version, I still feel the same way, although they don't seem quite as accurate. The graphics haven't been altered in any way, so unfortunately the game doesn't support any modern resolutions. This isn't game-ruining though, I personally enjoy the dated graphics. If you're someone who played this game on PS2 or the OG Xbox, and want some nostolgia, I would highly recommend it. Coming from someone who has played the orignal version, I have to say, it's held up extremely well. I've never written a review on a game before, mostly because I'd only write a review on a game I had a huge issue with, or a really good time with. For anyone wanting to relive the past, or just try the game out when it's on sale: Don't hesitate. It's a great game if you're willing to get past the old graphics and ocasionally clunky controls. I give it a 10/10."

211820,Starbound,nice game. it can be hard but also easy.  and its NOT terraria.
211900,Conquest of Elysium 3,this is worse than the movie jack and jill staring adam sandler and him again.... just bad
211970,Test Drive®: Ferrari Racing Legends,"The game is bad, even worse is games for Windows live. It's worse than EA Origin and that's saying something. Just don't get this, you will be very frustrated."
212010,Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD,"TL,DR: An alright Lite spacesim for when you don't have 20 hours to learn a game.   It's an alright and simple enough space combat game with a nice enough plot and world, with enough to do to keep you going to the end and enough items to keep you upgrading until then as well. Consider picking this up if the X-series (or similar) seem too daunting, but you'd like something in their vain."
212030,Kung Fu Strike: The Warrior's Rise,"Once You adjust the settings in the config file, this is like making one of those crazy movies where people can fly while fighting and other sillyness. I recommend this to anyone who has watched all of the martial arts movies they have and want to see a new one. Yes, I am recommending this to those who want to see a martial arts movie. No it is not live action but it is no less entertaining. A movie offers ~2 hours of entertainment. I am not even half way through this at 1.7 hours. I do recomend a controller."
212050,Resonance,"A interesting point and click adventure game, with some modern innovations. Your characters have Long Term Memory, which record important events in the game, and you can drag any item in the world to your Short Term Memory as well, allowing you to bring up any of these objects or memories in a conversation with someone.  Envoronments are well done, voice acting is great, and the Sci-fi thriller story is interesting and engaging... with some major twists towards the end.  There are a couple of endings, and some of the puzzles have a couple of different ways of solving them as well. All the puzzles have logical (if not always obvious) solutions which make sense, and there's a couple of optional puzzles in there too.  An excellent modern adventure game."

212410,Inversion™,How am i supposed to play a game that crashes and or doesn't display the screen when i'm trying to do ANYTHING. I wanted to record this game but with what little bit I was actually able to play it feels like gears of war if you stripped it of a good game and ♥♥♥♥ on it

212580,The Amazing Spider-Man,"the ♥♥♥♥ is with this port, i should be able to max this out and get a steady 60fps if not higher, and yet it runs like ♥♥♥♥ on 'amazing' or low graphical settings."
212630,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier,"Do NOT purchase this game! Ubisoft has released a broken port that us absolutely unplayable. From the Forums, my personal experience and the patching issues they have had, approximately 25% of consumers have a broken, unplayable product, and over 50% are experiencing issues that break some part of the game (multiplayer, guerilla mode or campaign mode)."

212700,Party of Sin,"This game had so much potential but as I am completely unable to change the controls and even after trying how they are, this game is unplayable and I am leaving disappointed. If the option to be able to change the controls from the 'god awful' WASD scheme to a custom setting, I would truly love this game.  But at this time, I am pleading a pass and I wish I could have asked for a refund instead of idling for the cards for the game. I would gladly give the .35 that I earned from the card sales to be able to pass on this game.  For a cheat...press the following by using the keys in the order I am giving you here.(UP, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT....back to the story and ask for a refund.) ...yep, thats about right."
212780,New Star Soccer 5,A great arcade football game where you play as only one player at the huge field. You'll be responsible to train your player and make him rich!  I can't recommend it enough to football fans.
212800,Super Crate Box,The game is very fun but after a while it gets a bit hard....and annoying Im a casual gamer and gets bored if I never win the task [Or stage] the game is good don't get me wrong Im just saying they needs to be a 'Easier' mode for players who are not die hard people who are willing to try over and over again to win

213330,LEGO® Batman™ 2: DC Super Heroes,"It's an enjoyable game if you pick it up once every month or so, but the novely of it wears off very quickly. The hub world is very repetitive, as is the gameplay. Great as a time waster, but as a game, especially compared to the first one, is overall just meh"
213350,MDK 2 HD,"I'm a big fan of the MDK series. However, this version is broken and has far too many bugs. "
213610,Sonic Adventure™ 2 ,"While occasionally buggy and not my personal favorite Sonic game, Sonic Adventure 2 and its remake SA2Battle are still quite enjoyable to a newcomer to the Sonic franchise like me. While most find the mech shooting boring and the emerald hunting confusing, I found them a nice and relaxed contrast to most of the high-speed but still enjoyable running levels Sonic is so famous for. And or course, the Chao Garden is a cute little side mode for raising your little pals, even though there is no way to take them with you like in the game's console releases."
213650,Dwarfs F2P,"I can't, in my life, ever know a game with such horrible mechanics and A.I. ever. I don't know if that maybe is the point, but if I wanted an experience like this I think I'd babysit my neighbour's braindead kids.  This is more irritating than a challenge. Free or not, it's definitely not worth it."

21400,Project Aftermath,"This is a C&amp;C game (Command and Conquer), not too polished, but it still has the charm, Definitely not worth the $10 price tag, if you want a good C&amp;C game, get red alert 3, I did, and I found it a much more polished game, with better graphics, and better music. Only problem is that it's on origin, though I think it is also on Steam too. I got it during a humble bundle hosted by EA."

214170,Divine Divinity,Incredible old school RPG which I recommend for anyone wanting a good game from the days of old.
214250,I Am Alive,This game is AMAZING!!!!!! If you like Assassin's Creed and The Last of Us this is the game for you.
214340,Deponia,This game is pretty funny. Sometimes it takes a while to complete a puzzle but the commentary and voice acting ar great and I relate to the main character quite a bit.
214360,Tower Wars,"Terrible mouse control, it moves the pointer around when you enter and exit radial menus. Visually it is very noisy and unclear what is happening on-screen (e.g. turrets vs creeps).  These compund each other - it moves your mouse pointer, and then its hard to find again because it is so similar to other visual effects. Mechanically, its all a very standard tower defense. It does add sending waves of creeps at the other side, but doesn't do anytihng interesting with it."
214420,Gear Up,fun for a free game
214490,Alien: Isolation,"Amazing game. Beat the game on hard, which is recommended when selecting a difficulty. It took me 25-ish hours.  I played in the dark with headphones and on a 100' projector in the living room. There were many times when I thought the game was over, and then it turns out I wasn't even close. The coolest aspect is the overall horror sci-fi cinematic experience that they hold strong for the entire game, truly they are masters of the craft. I was loving what I was playing and screaming like a little girl while trying to escape from my couch out of shock and fear. This game perfectly captures the Alien movies in many details including many subtle details.  They are very good at keeping the game going and keeping the gamer engaged, but once it was over - it was just over. After playing with so many hours stuck right in the middle of a huge survival climax that never ends, I guess it's hard to properly end that experience.  Only negative, no resolution to the story or a proper ending. The gift of the gameplay and realization of the Alien Sci-Fi world was so enjoyable though, that it can be forgiven."
214510,LEGO® The Lord of the Rings™,"I don't know if it was the shoe horning in of plot and lines from the films but this game felt incredibly disjointed and despite finishing it (but not 100%) I'm not actually sure I enjoyed playing it. Which is a shame as I loved the Star Wars and Harry Potter Lego games.  Looks nice enough, clever use of an open world but.... for me, it's a thumbs down"

214590,Fairy Bloom Freesia,"Let me get started with the positives. The soundtrack is pleasant and enjoyable. The game, on a sale, is cheap as chips. All the keys are fully rebindable (on controller, anyway. Not sure to what extent they are rebindable on keyboard). The game's story also seems like it may have some interesting ideas.   Unfortunately, that's about all I can recommend, as the game just isn't satisfying to play. The combat arenas, while pretty, are repetitive, small, and clausterphobic. The combat, while functional, feels very stiff and can be inconsistently responsive. Every single part (not just special attacks, mind you) of Freesia's moveset is locked off behind a leveling wall, which really doesn't help matters. I mean, progression is fair game, but not when that it compromises the core gameplay loop.  The enemies themselves fail to remedy the issue as well. While the basic enemies are nearly brain-dead and incredibly easy to dispatch, when facing a boss, if you intend to stay alive for any period of time, you best block every single of the attacks while you whittle down the incredibly long health bar.   Bored. I moved to pastures new."

214730,Space Rangers HD: A War Apart,"edit: reading other comments, lowering difficulty does not help, pirates are OP and they own you. Such a disappointment. Just play original SR 2, much more fun.  Not really recommended on normal difficulty. It is harcore on normal difficulty. I have played original space rangers, it was so much fun. Difficult sometimes but not impossible. This one is overall much better, but the difficulty kills the game value. As I have finished the original, I cant even progress on this one at normal difficulty, may be it is me I dont know.   FOR THE ORIGINAL: One of the best games ever. Gives you the old good gaming enjoyment. Once you start playing, it sucks you in."
214770,Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"Game is fun, I wish I could have continued playing. I'm not great with platformers though, and this one eventually gave me a puzzle I couldn't solve. If you are looking to play it due to the unique art style be warned, the game scales in difficulty FAST."
214790,The Basement Collection,"The Flash games that led up to the release of Super Meat Boy in one package! Each one has social commentary of some kind with some new levels and features thrown in. But since they're still running in the security flaw known as Flash, they all have terrible optimization. Some games and extras must be unlocked (this might be frustrating to some)."
214830,Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy,"It's not a bad game. It's kinda fun. The problem for me is that it's only kinda fun. The gameplay is kind of like a puzzle game, but when you run out of time you have to start the puzzle over from scratch. The core of the puzzle element is deciding how to allocate your precious time, and this sort of challenge really isn't mentally stimulating, it's just a bit annoying. Basically, the core gameplay mechanic of trying to manage your time just isn't quite as fun as other gameplay mechanics. Also, the game pitches itself as a parody but I didn't really find anything to be very humorous. It definitely achieves a lighthearted tone, though. I wouldn't recommend this because there are games that are more fun and less 'mind numbing resource allocation' out there."
214850,GameMaker: Studio,"At first, Gamemaker might be hard to get used to, but when you get used to it, there's almost no limit to what you can create."
214870,Painkiller Hell & Damnation,"I have Painkliller Overdose which is an awesome first-person shooter. So when I got my hands on Hell and Damnation and got a hold of the stake gun, I fell in love with it. A very gothic art style which is awesome. Every enemy is well made. Just a fast paced shooter like doom or quake."
214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,  I love this game. I love the Roman Empire so this game is great. The imperator Augustus campaign is really fun and the battles are amazing.
214970,Intrusion 2,It's like Contra meets.... uh.... actually that'll do. It's like Contra.
21500,Pyroblazer,"Once you learn the courses, master the controls and work out the weapons this game is great fun looks good with interesting tracks it can be hard to see were your going at times but not if you play it in 3d i use iz3d and it looks amazing as if it was made for it. It does get very hard later on but i cant stop trying to beat it."
215080,WAKFU,"ok game, nice open world... but needed a bit more. when it came to dungeaons.... finding groups were difficult as you couldnt solo mid lvl dungeons"
215100,Ragnarok,My Childhood Game
215120,ROSE Online,why i cant log in my steam account in rose. Can any one try to fix it its almost 2days now.
215160,The Book of Unwritten Tales,"Point and click Perfection - well worth playing to the end, because the final act is just incredibly well put together."
215280,Secret World Legends,"'The Secret World flirts with brilliance and – at least, during earlier zones – looks primed to seal the deal. But, as time goes on, its seemingly bottomless bag of tricks starts to look a bit shallow. The story, world, skill system, and investigation missions definitely do their damndest to rewrite the MMO rulebook, but uninspired combat, ho-hum PVP, uninteresting late-game quests, and general clunkiness keep TSW's smartest innovations from truly shining.'"
215390,Damage Inc,"It is quite possibly a reasonable game. I cannot get the keyboard, a microsoft freestyle pro or a logitech extreme 3d pro to work with it. So I guess I will never know. More programmers who obviously don't have a clue."
215450,Transcripted,"It's back! It took almost 4 years of legal disputes, but it's back! Gotta put in a good word here, this game is fun and deserves more recognition. If you like twin stick shooters/puzzle games, definitely pick this up."
215470,Primal Carnage,Its a really fun game and its cheap too!
215510,Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken,  any one can play online with me on this game 
215530,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing,"I bought this because thinking it allows 2 players like 'Lara Croft &amp; Guardian of Light' but it seems that the tags 'Multi-player' + 'co-op' does not mean that?  Bought it in bulk during the last Black Friday sale, only loaded the game recently, am too late."
215550,Zombie Playground™,"I'm editing my previous review out of newfound spite for this game.  My previous review stated that I would recommend this game with a fantasticly placed and thought out 'na'  Seeing the development of the game, I would like to reconsider my absolutely awful review and say that my review clearly stated the quality, time and care that the developers put into this mess of a game.   Basically, don't waste your time; the game is NOT done and NEVER will be. You will probably have better fun burning paper and stapling yourself in the face, and you won't have to pay for that.   I refuse to mention any of the gameplay because, there simply is none."
215630,Demonicon,"It is a witcher wannabe that is fun but not great. Combat is combo based and kinda button-mashy, the story is good but nothing extraordinary. There are a lot of story branches to add replayability. Fun game to fill up time between other, better action RPGs"
215670,Home,  I really like the pixel style of art work. At the start of the game I really was tense. I expected more horror and less investigation. In the end though I put together eveything that happened and god a fair few of the achivements. Min 3 runs for 100% from what I have seen I will need ~4 runs. It is best to play the game in one sitting and just getting out of my first run I can't justify picking it back up. At the price point though I would say it is well worth the experiance. Actions tend to reflect the games ending and I could encourage you on the first run to go all the places and interact with all the things.
215690,Zeno Clash 2,"Well, first things first the story is all ovet the place, when I thought it was going somewhere it swerved off into mental land. The gameplay can be a bit static from time to time too, but despite that I found it quite fun. Story and gameplay aside, the really great thing about this game is the gorgeous, psychedelic and imaginative places (and its occupants) it takes you and for me it made it worth while."
215710,Fieldrunners 2,"This game got me through my studies, i played it once or twice...."
215770,Shad'O,"Never buy this game, it needs specific version of QuickTime, it will not work without this bullcrap. Plus even tho Quick Time has exploits and will put your PC at risk."
215870,Dungeon Party,Worst game there is.  The player base is 0 and when you find a game noone knows what they do.  not worth your time. 
215930,Jagged Alliance 2 - Wildfire ,"Someone asked for a review. So here's one from an expert. First off if you have never played a Jagged Alliance game or played one but only on normal difficulty or lower this game is not for you. For those of you who have defeated JA1 JA2 Diedranna lives, Urban chaos and the rest. All on hard iron man mode Wildfire may be worth a try. You will find more enemies and higher level ones earlier. More snipers on roofs. Coordination between snipers and units on the ground behind sandbag bunkers. And land mines. Losts and lots of landmines. Earlier and more often than vanilla JA2. And I don't know if this was just the luck of the draw but I did not find my first metal detector until about halfway through the game. Before that I had to send my bomb guy crawling around everywhere before I could do anything. Sometimes under enemy fire. A process I found mostly tedious. There are some changes to the plot but honestly they are not really worth talking about. The new voice actor for Miguel sucks. All the maps are totaly redone. So anything you remember from the layout of JA2 will do you no good here. And for those of you who remember the mod 'Diedranna Lives' I do see one thing this game has in common with that one. In both cases early on when I was weak and not well armed I found the game very challenging. One early Wildffire SAM site in particular was an almost impossible battle given the mercs and equipment that I had at the time. But like in 'Diedranna Lives' in Wildfire around Cambria (mid game) I found myself with well trained mercs who were armed to the teeth. And the difficulty level went down considerably. Grenades mortors and LAWS drop like candy in this game. To compensate I suppose for the hard difficulty. As a result I often blind fired mortors at places I suspected the enemy might be. I had so many of the things I might as well. So, my final recommendation? Thumbs up, barely. But only for experts. The rest should stay away. Play vanilla JA2 first. Then if you really like that consider this game."
21600,Age of Booty,"its slow , and bored,"
216090,Go Home Dinosaurs!,"If u love Tower Defence games, u have to grab it. Super cute, challenging and nicely done TD clone ! :)"
216110,Tiny Troopers,"Reminds me a lot of Cannon Fodder. The gameplay is simply and somewhat addictive. It's good to play even if you only have 5 - 10 minutes for a quick playthrough, that's usually enough for one mission. I'm not usually into cartoon graphics but they work really nice here."
216130,Gemini Wars,Can't fully control the camera at points and is just average.
216150,MapleStory,"Maplestory.. more like, maintenance story, still a great game tho"
216210,Secret Files 3,"I bought this game to complete the series.  Sadly it is rather disappointing compared to the first two games. If you feel the need to finish a game series I'd still recommend it, otherwise try to stay away."
216260,Don Bradman Cricket 14,"They put in an online check, cant even start the game without it. so if you arent in range of an internet connection you are totally screwed, even for single player mode, this cuts my play time in half :( Guess this is why people end up using pirate copies, developers alienate their own player base ...  DO NOT BUY THIS, BE WARE !!!!"
216290,Gateways,"At first, Gateways looks like a clone of Portal minus the Z-axis. And for the first twenty or so minutes, that's basically what it turns out to be.  However, it isn't long until the game's true nature reveals itself. It's a cross between a metroidvania and a puzzler. The game takes place in a single massive level, and you're supposed to go from place to place gathering powerups that let you go to the next place. Those powerups are new puzzle tools you use to solve the puzzles blocking the way to the next powerup. It even has optional powerups, just like any good metroidvania.  It's put together quite well. There are help points for each puzzle that can first tell you (for a small cost*) if your current powerups are enough to solve the puzzle and, if so, can then show you (for a large cost*) how they are solved. That being said, the puzzles (at least thus far) have been trivially easy to solve. Maybe the tough ones are reserved for the end of the game. We'll see. At least it has a level editor and workshop support.  *These costs are paid with in-game pickups. I figure this is worth clarifying in this day and age of in-app purchases."
216390,Fallen Enchantress,"Make sure you get Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes instead. You may think it's the expansion, but it's the full game with the expansion. You don't need to get this one. Get the edition with all the DLC, because you'll want all that. It's worth it."
21640,FLOCK!,"If you've ever done herding miniquests in games, you know what this is like after a while."
21660,Street Fighter IV,"You need Windows Game Live, but it's not supported on Windows 10. Can't play...."
216670,Great Big War Game,A very silly game that gets much more complex as you go along
21670,Bionic Commando,"+Nice menu, looks good and navigation trough is satisfactory +Grapling mechanics are well made +Badass looking main hero  -Checkpoint positions -Water, almost impossible to get out of it once you miss grabing something -False open world feel, it looks like you can choose your path, but if you try to not follow corridor developers chose, you will die in radiation... -OP snipers -Predictable and holywood style story -Xbox buttons instead of keyboard buttons in tutorials  Game is pretty much mediocre, obvious port from xbox 360. At first it plays nicely and i really tried to get into it, but there's just too much things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off after about hour of game. I would reccomend to skip this one. "
21680,Bionic Commando Rearmed," When able to play the game its fun for a few mins, then it get painfully boring.  If you're an old school gamer like myself and love capcom games maybe just go with Mega Man ???  Not saying Bionic Commando is bad or anything along those lines but it could have been better and the controls could have been better as-well.  I'd give it a 5.5 out of 10... Not just because the game is boring or the controls are terrible... I had to download NVIDIA PHYSX SYSTEM SOFTWARE... Without downloading that crap it wouldn't work, well I had installed the most up-to-date driver for my video card yet I still needed to download that crap. Eh, 5.5 out of 10 for that crap..   Eh since the game does in-fact run and is playable I would recommend people to try it. My taste isn't the same as everyone else.   "
216890,Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition,"A great game, pretty much a straight translation of the tabletop rules. A great way to play Bloodbowl with friends that live far away.   Do note however, that it is a dice game, with all the pros and cons of one. You can play a perfect game, be a master at tactics, but if the dice hate you, you can do diddly squat about it! If you take this game too seriously you will soon become frustrated by it, in the end it is best played casually between friends.  Online leagues is where it is at and there are not too many people online at the moment, I suggest getting the game with a couple of friends and playing it when you all have time to.   Also, buy re-rolls when making a team, ALL THE RE-ROLLS!"
21690,Resident Evil 5,"If you have GFWL Version, dont bother, even for achievements sake."
216910,Of Orcs And Men,"Honestly? The game just doesn't work well. Combat and gameplay are aggrivating and slow. There's little to no control other than selecting actions, which sometimes works really well but not in this. The dialogue was awful, listening to your main characters talk is just painful and everything sounds incredibly forced. It wasn't even all that original, the whole thing just comes across as incredibly unsatisfying."
216930,Luxor Amun Rising HD,"This (in my opinion) is the best game in the luxor franchise. Great graphics, Fantastic music and amazing level design. Couldn't recommend this game."
217100,Dementium II HD,"I sometimes like retro games and retro style themed games like 8 bit Miami Hotline, The Last Door series and Into the Gloom. So why this particular game failed was not, because of the simple visuals. It failed, because it had no flare, no originality, no style, no substance. It felt like just another rehashed generic linear offering. Dementium II HD is the king of the generic horror hill."
217120,Waves 2: Notorious, Early Access Review
217140,Rise of the Triad,"Poorly thought out maps, poor engine optimization and bugs everywhere. It seems that this game is made by drunk or inexperienced devs.   Yes I get the nostalgia etc but this is simply not fun. Most of the time you can't carry more than 3 weapon types and all are boring as hell. For example there are 4+ types of rocket launcers, all basically the same except for the weapon's textures. The multiplayer aspect is practically non-existant, at least I wasn't able to find a server with more than 2 or 3 players.  If you want a good FPS experience try Serious Sam, Black Mesa or the original Painkiller."
217200,Worms Armageddon,peace of ♥♥♥♥ get worms revolution for the same price its the best  
217270,Karateka ,Great Remake of the old classic if your a true retoro lover then you love this game.
217690,Anna - Extended Edition,"Apparently, Anna has mixed reviews, and I totally understand why. It has major flaws, which may be repulsive for a lot of people. To be honest, I gave up my first attempt of this game after trying to like it for an hour or so. The unbearable defects that are commonly complained about in the negative reviews of this game: lagged visual movements (poor optimization), ugly UI, and the awkward control. On the other hand, despite the incompetence in those aspects, this game is outstanding in my opinion.  The soul of Anna as a game, is undoubtedly its story. Our nameless protagonist, an archeologist, is haunted by reoccuring dreams and déjà vu of a fenced sawmill located in the depths of a mountainous region in Italy, and a woman who seems to have a mysterious bond with him, called Anna. In his last dream, he finally finds himself inside the fence, and feels the presence of Anna ever closer, awaiting in that very house. A tragedy about love and madness, is to be unveiled.   Just like how the protagonist is enchanted by Anna and keeps returning to the mill in his dreams, I somehow returned to the game several times in the span of one year and I finally had the patience to play it through. I must admit, it was definitely worthy.  To be clear, Anna is a story-based, atmospheric puzzle game featuring psychological horror.  Aesthetically, this game is great. When I was outside the house, it was lively and colorful. Once I stepped inside the house, it became gloomy and depressive. As I ventured deeper, the scene grew even more gruesome and macabre. The background music and sound effects of the game are executed perfectly and make significant contribution to the atmosphere. The chirps of the birds, the chatter of the brook, the rustles of the leaves outside the mill, and the creaks of the doors and the floor, the whispers of the ghosts inside the house, combined to be one of the most unforgettable immersion that I had ever experienced in a game.   There're lots of reading in this game as well, from the protagonist's personal journal to books about fairy tales and cult rituals, varying from two or three pages to more than ten. Some people may find it tedious to read so much in a game but I enjoy it most of the time. The stories and lores in this game are actually interesting and well-written, and sometimes they're related to the puzzles you'll need to solve.  The puzzles in this games are generally vague and abstract, which makes sense as most of them involving ritual procedures or cult traditions. It may take you plenty of time trying to figure out the correct combination of items and wondering what to do next. I'm kind of regretful for resorting to a walkthrough late in the game becuase I had been concentrating for so long that my brain probably became fatigue, which broke the immersion and reduced the sense of achievement each time I solved a puzzle.  The game has 8 different endings so there's some replayability if you wanna try them out. It took me 5 hours to finish my first complete playthrough (assisted by a guide in the fifth hour). It's better to beat the game within one or to days to get a more continuous experience.  Overall, Anna is not for everyone, especially the ones who don't care much for the story in a game and those who are just looking for a casual game to kill some time.  That's about all I have to say. Anna you're flawed, yet you're beautiful in many other ways. How could I ever forget you?"
217750,Age of Conan: Unchained,"Great game  One of the few mmo's that's still hard and has an actual learning curve. Also one of the rare mmo's with a mature theme.  The game is not for everyone, but this goes for most mmo's.  And you do not have to spend real money on everything, things such as Bags for more bagspace are even sold by vendors"
21780,Driver: Parallel Lines,Brings back good ol' memories.
217860,Special Forces: Team X,Game is fun but community is completely dead :(
217920,Alien Rage - Unlimited,"Its got pretty graphics, a superb art style and is clearly heavily inspired by greater games such as Gears of War and Bulletstorm, but Alien Rage has unrefined combat mechanics which makes it a chore, not a pleasue to play. With uneven difficulty spikes and poor checkpoint placement and not unique mechanics, it isnt obvious why you would play this given life is finite and there are much better shooters."
21800,Tom Clancy's EndWar,"Pretty fun game if you can pick it up for cheap, runs well, graphics are alright but nothing special. Appears to be no conntroller support (at least not for my xbox pad) which was a bit annoying as controlling the camera in this game would be smoother with a controller.  Rather than being a general with an all seeing eye in this game you play a colonel in control of a task force and you can only see what your units can which means use of the mini map is vital. This creates some really interesting intense moments and is a bit fresher than some other similar games.   I will say that the voice commands work great about 80% of the time but the odd word will not be recognized first time around (the game doesn't recognise me saying the word 'two' I assume because of my accent) but it is usually alright. In short the game (if bought cheap enough) offers a pretty refreshing RTS experience with 5-10 hours of fun in the right hands and performs perfectly at least on my rig.  EDIT* I have played this game previously (for about 6 hours) but it wasn't on steam"
218020,Nethergate: Resurrection,Looks simple but it's fun to play and it's well worth buying for such a low price that you can get on a sale
218040,Democracy 2,Glorious! The most boringly awsome game Yet!
218060,BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien,Runner2 is a game that I had an unexpected amount of fun with. The blend of rhythm game mechanics with a mostly tight runner structure is a great idea and really makes every level enjoyable. I absolutely recommend this one.
218090,Unity of Command,"Don't be fooled, this is a puzzle game with a tacked on war theme.   There are no historically recognisable strategies or tactics to develop, only a single solution per 'puzzle'. The predeterministic narrative encourages the player to tediously gaming the system by re-booting each scenario until he finally gets a successful attack that he can build upon.   I would only recommend it to my enemies."
218130,Dungeonland,Currently the community is basically dead and they never really fixed the various Network related problems.  Try it out only if you have some friends eager to play with you and that are not easily frustrated by QoL problems like not having the ability to directly invite them in a lobby.
218230,PlanetSide 2,Love this game Very fun to play with friends i recommend this game to all fps players
218410,Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten,"I really enjoy the rpg elements added into this tower game. Things can get rather grindy though once you get a lot of units, especially if you want good equipment for them and 3 stars in all levels. Overall a very fun game, if you don't mind some grinding."
218510,Planets Under Attack,Animations are nice and campaign is fine (little hard though). But don't expect you will play multiplayer because it is dead. Also this game could have been one of the best of this genre if only it was updated with more content (it is obvious by design that developers intended to add more campaigns but they never did).
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Payday 2 WAS like great relationship. It had its rough moments and it had its good moments. But that was until it all went to ♥♥♥♥. On the two year anniversary, Overkill went and literally DRILLED me in ma butt. No lube. No protection. Not even a warning. Relationship and poophole ruined &lt;/3.         #relationshipgoals  EDIT: Them microtransaction drills are gone so it's alright"
218640,Lucius,"First time I finished Lucius it was cool, but on second time it wasn´t bad but it´s not game you would like to play many times...  but I can´t say anything bad on it  so 10/10"
218660,iBomber Attack,Just go ahead and buy it.
218680,Scribblenauts Unlimited,Amazing Game Overall. Runs Smoothly on even the ♥♥♥♥♥iest of PCS. Endless Amount of fun For all ages. You can even make tis game even more unique by customizing it to your liking.
218700,Angelica Weaver: Catch Me When You Can - Collector’s Edition,"This game is set up as point and click but the puzzles are dumb and when you solve them you don't feel like you accomplished anything you are just given more dumb puzzles to do. The concept of a psychic cop solving crimes and going back to Jack the Ripper's day in ye' old London, solving those crimes, and then using them to help her solve the case she's working on in the present is very uniqie and entertaining. I give gold stars for originality plot wse but ultimately it's just not well done and comes across as slow and dull. If you like point and click/puzzle solving games or appreciate unique plot buy it on sale"
218740,Pid ,"The controls felt loose, there were a number of deaths that were just caused by the weird jump.  But more than that, the game isn't that interesting. The story is... alright. Not super engaging. And the puzzles aren't enough to keep me excited. I put in several hours, I gave it an honest try, I think it's boring."
218820,Mercenary Kings,Great art style and fun co op game for family and friend to play together.
218980,Patterns,It just never went anywhere. Tried to be another minecraft and failed.
219070,Miner Wars Arena ,3rd person space ship glider deathmatch. it is called 'miners' because the whole battlefield is a solid rock and you have to dig space to fight at first. diggin ist instant and ressourceless so... whats the point? I did not enjoy
219150,Hotline Miami,It's so hard it's not fun
219190,Ultratron,"It does not have an epilepsy warning in the beginning or anywhere that I can find, If you have epilepsy, DO NOT buy this game. I wish I could refund because so many flashing colors. I didn't care about the video's saying it I just got a coupon and it was really cheap so I just bought it. Yeah I don't recommend this game because of flashing lights."
219600,NBA 2K13,It's pretty good.
219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"It was a great game when it worked. But, I have only been able to play one game. After that one game, the servers stopped loading games. I didn't change my settings, I didn't apply any filters. They just stopped loading.  I have tried everything, deleting my config file, editing my config file, restarting steam, restarting the game, restarting my computer. I even did the command propmpt to flush my ip address. I redownloaded the game twice. Nothing worked. I can't play the game anymore.  But it was fun while it worked! And it still works for my buddies. But I'm not the only one this happens to. I'd be happy to recommend it once this problem is solved. But until then I'd have to recommend against buying it."
219680,Proteus,"Proteus is an intriguing experience filled with auditory and visual stimuli. The simplicity that comes with exploring Proteus leaves the player in a world bound only by the limits of what they are willing to explore. If you are interested in taking some time to relax, then Proteus is an adventure for you."
219700,Dogs of War Online - Beta,Great Game. Sadly the player population is gone :/
219740,Don't Starve,Tip: Don't Starve XD
219760,Beyond Divinity,"This game is a follow-up story to Divine Divinity--although Larian never conceived of it as an actual sequel. It has much in common with DD, but is less ambitious in scope and not as open (two of its four acts are quite linear). I guess I'm one of the minority who like it about as much as the original title.  BAD  - For me it was a bit glitchy--occasionally crashed entirely, with other (non-game breaking) bugs, such as a quest log that wouldn't scroll down and would go wonky on occasion.  - Some of the things it tries with the builds don't quite come off. For example, some of the skills simply don't have their advertised value. (Advice: do your research ahead of time, and this won't be painful.)  - As others have noted, the voice acting ranges from mediocre to bad. But sometimes the badness is amusing. (My favorite was when a single character was voiced by two different actors in the same dialogue, with different accents and everything.)  - The balancing isn't always quite right. The first act is a bit too difficult relative to the rest.  DEBATABLE  +/- Battlefields are pretty boring if you actually go through the tedium of clearing out the dungeons. But I actually think the mechanic of having these optional areas works out well--you have merchants whenever you need them, and if you feel like grinding for levels, it's there for you. (Note: I did the Act I battlefield dungeons and skipped the rest.)  +/- Unless you really want to tackle those battlefields, this game is smaller and less open than DD...but for my money, that's not really a problem.  +/- The overall story makes a bad first impression (it looks at first blush like a haphazard mess), but a very good last impression (the pieces end up fitting together). Unlike at least one other reviewer here, I think the last act is the best part of either BD or DD.  GOOD  + Good ol' Larian goofiness is back. The subquests still have that flavor.  + I think the puzzles here are often pretty clever, and they come at you a bit more quickly than they do in DD--especially in the (more linear) first and fourth acts.  + Having two characters to control adds another layer of strategy missing from DD.  OVERVIEW  If you want the finest of Larian's stuff, pass right on by and look to Original Sin. But if you're on a Larian kick, there's really no reason to skip over this title--it's perfectly enjoyable."
219780,Divinity II: Developer's Cut,"Game doesn't have native controller support, requires a 3rd party program such as Xpadder to function.  Game's camera feels choppy/is stuttering, Some kind of FPS problem? Still searching for a fix. Might have to refund if this can't be resolved."
219830,King Arthur's Gold,"It's a fun game with nice mechanics and idea, but playing it feels more like a chore.  The controls aren't very fluid and take a lot of getting used to.  Building can be confusing and challenging at first, that combined with playing with a bunch of people you don't know, leads to much chaos and raging.   Now those are things that can add chaos and fun to the game or just require practice to get good at, but the rest is not, really.   I've been playing this game over the weekend. Only a max of 10 servers have been up: Only two of them are official, and one of them is always full. Most of the other servers either don't work for some reason, or are very low on players. Team Deathmatches can be fun, but because the combat is so simplistic, you either rekt or get rekt'd. There's not a lot of skill involved, just timing and luck.  You're going to suck most of the time in most games, playing fairly will lead to you losing most of the time, you can't even grief when you get mad or else you get banned, fair enough, but most of that is just my own personal rantings.  I would say that the biggest sin is that the game has a low population, so you can't experience a whole lot. The best servers that make the game better are the ones that try to be their own thing and SHOULD be their own games: An RP server, and Shiprekt, to be more specific.   My advice is this: Buy Terraria, play on a PvP server. You get a WHOLE lot more out of Terraria, there's SEVERAL different servers that are active due to the game's popularity, and the controls and gameplay is much more smooth.  None the less, it wasn't a bad buy for $10. I spend more on gum and beer, and I run through those fast."
219890,Antichamber,"Antichamber is perhaps the absolute worst example of how to handle an art game. Everything about this game reeks of pretentiousness due to the game's attempt to try and pass off its minamalistic nature and annoying design flaws as an artistic statement and that it sacrifices the potential enjoyment of the game for the purpose of being weird. The game's puzzles are often illogical and make no sense, and even when they are they tend to require complete mastery of the awkward keyboard controls which defeats the point of it being a puzzle game. Even worse is that the game makes frequent use of poorly designed, first person jumping puzzles that also rely heavily on reflexes. The game is always silent except for this low hum that barely qualifies as music and the graphics look like what one would expect from an early prototype.  The only thing Antichamber accomplishes is that it looks kind of abstract. This effect wears off after about 10 minutes. Not even close to being worth 20 dollars.

219910,Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes,"At first i tought i won't like this game, but i got soo hoocked up by it. Really fun to play. And can't say it is super easy, you really need to think how to solve everything and get trought to next thing."
219950,NiGHTS into Dreams...,I simply have no idea what this game is about. Do you have to take drugs in order to even enjoy this ? I've been playing the first few levels several times now and I can't get past the first 'boss'. I'm giving up. I don't think I'll ever get high enough to enjoy this.  [Rating: 63/100]
219990,Grim Dawn,"Love this game, the customisation is amazing and this game is severally underrated. You will get your moneys worth. If you like ARPG games then you will like this one."
220,Half-Life 2,It's SuperMegaCool !!!
2200,Quake III Arena,The best game ever made so far.
22000,World of Goo,Neat puzzles with physics. Worth the money at sale.
220090,The Journey Down: Chapter One,"I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not there. I can forgive the somewhat rough animations and moderately unlikeable main character, but this game just oozes other problems.   +Interesting art style -Rather dull point and click puzzles -Awkard writing and voice acting  -Clearly a prologue to a larger story, but does very little to entice you into that story  Some of the voice acting is ok, but a lot of it sounds like it was recorded using very low quality equipment or is very poorly mixed. A few characters sound like they're trying to over enunciate or put emphasis on every line, which gets grating. Voice line clarity is all over the place and syncing is frequently off, with entire cutscenes being horrendously desynced. Even if you turn the sound off, the writing is nothing special.  This is very clearly a prologue to a larger story, but instead does little to actually draw you into that story. Most of the exposition is in a few large, obvious dumps. We aren't so much shown there's a large conspiracy as we are repeatedly told about it, and if cutting someone's power for non-payment is supposed to make the local mega-corp look particularly evil you could at least make the victims look less like a couple of bums abusing a company's goodwill. Character relationships jump all over the place, making it hard to get invested in anyone, and it's very obvious from 15 minutes in that virtually all the characters are simply living puzzle stand-ins that could just as easily be replaced by a pile of items and a note. There are elements of a better story here, but for the most part it's just a game of busy work.  Speaking of puzzles, they're pretty bad, even for a point and click. Virtually all of them are use object on object inventory puzzles that may or may not carry a great deal of logic to them. There's a somewhat interesting if basic phone puzzle early on, but that puzzle style seems to be quietly dropped as soon as you leave the house. It's the 'click around the map until you find an item then click that item on every other item in the world' school of puzzle design.  At exactly one hour in, the game crashed, and I just don't think I'll ever be going back to it. It just did nothing to pull me in."
220160,Trials Evolution Gold Edition,"The game is very good. Uplay is completely rubish, it asks you to connect to steam, it is slow and really a pain. To play on the internet is completely disabled by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ app from ubisoft, the greatest crap creator! Thank you for vaccination to any of your games. Greetings!"
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Goog game. but this rating is about the Forums. Absolutly Horrible Staff, Bad Community leader, Overall Horrible, Bans without reasons Ect.  Edit: KasperVld the former community lead is out, Review still negative as they are ignoring my Emails."
220240,Far Cry® 3,"i enjoyed the hell out of it, untill uplay didnt want to play  ♥♥♥♥ing udontplay if i do say so myself :)"
220260,Farming Simulator 2013,"Every time I tried to figure out how to do livestock farming and just hire out all the tedious crop farming, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. I tried looking up YouTube videos on this game. They all pretty much did the same thing; 'It's just like the last version of this game, except for these new bits!' Maybe you've had to be in the series for some time, not sure. Even after the lengthy tutorials I was lost as to how to progress the farm in the ways I wanted. I guess I'm looking for just a simple ranching game, so take my review with a grain of salt based on that."
220420,Nancy Drew: The Deadly Device,"I wouldn't really recommend this game even though I'm a fan of Nancy Drew games.. I mean if you're a fan, then buy it, but if you're not sure of buying this game or not, don't. Unless it's on dramatically big sale.. Personally I like the old Nancy games tbh but it's just a matter of taste. Ghost of Thornton hall is a nice game  Pros:  *Tbh nothing but the voice acting   Cons:  * Bad graphics (worse than other nancy games in my opinion) *Too hard (had to cheat to just get through with the story)  CONCLUSION: Buy only if you're a fan and it's on sale "
220440,DmC Devil May Cry,"This game was a fun ride. Although it was pretty short. I am mostly unfamiliar with hack and slash games, yet I finished this game with its Vergil's downfall dlc in 11.4 hours on the middle starting difficulty.   The replay value is awful though with its back tracking to an old mission with abilities unlocked in a new mission to get secrets.  This game had me hugging my controller and made me feel like a badass whenever it flashed combat ratings at me (usually s or sss).  I enjoyed the ideas and world presented, the ending was good in my opinion too.  I will say that I didn't like Dante's new look and personality at first. However It did eventually grow on me (in the end cutscenes...) when it clicked that this is not the old Dante but still a good character.  Costume and weapon dlc is pointless and mostly unnoticed during gameplay (even the cutscenes ignore the dlc sometimes, pre-rendered or not)  Over all. This was a good game in my opinion. I liked the odd characters and enemy designs, fast fighting styles and boss fights. The visuals and music were a topping on the cake for me too.  Get this game if you feel like having a quick hack and slash experience. You can always play arena modes or do a last sweep if you've already finished.  Personally, I'm never touching this game again. I'm happy with it and want to move on to something else, maybe I'll start up the HD collection on my Xbox 360 that I've hardly touched."
220460,Cargo Commander,"I bought this game on the cheap, it is a little repetitve, but the gameplay is fun, and the soundtrack would get stuck in my head. I really liked this game."
220660,StarDrive,Awesome 4x strategy!
220700,RPG Maker VX Ace,"People will constantly tell you it's easy to use,  It isn't."
220780,Thomas Was Alone,Absolutely Lovely. The game itself is ok. The grafics and the ambience are wonderful and the story and speaker are absolutely great. Despite the gameplay being a bit too simplistic for my taste this is one of the most vrecommendable games I've played the last few years.
220820,Zombie Driver HD,"Fails every time to start. Steam integrity check finds 1 corrupted file every time and re-downloads it. Fails to start again. Everything else on my PC works fine, no viruses to make the files corrupt and such.  -/10  Once it starts and is running I'll evaluate it."
220860,McPixel,sometimes funny. Much stupid stuff. Would be okay for one euro if the gameplay wouldn't be just trial and error. Most of stuff doesnt make sense and is just there to be more funny. Maybe funny with friends but I was just disappointed about this trial and error.
220900,Jack Lumber,"If I hadn't received this game as part of a Humble Bundle I probably wouldn't own it. It's very clearly a mobile game converted into a desktop game... and it's a decent passtime (for a whole five minutes of occasional play), but it's really unfulfilling."
220960,ACDSee 15,"It is ACDsee. indeed. but the integration with steam is no good. Steam has to be launched for acd to work. and all in your friends list can see when you are watvhing pictures.....(!) The program itself is as good as one could expect from acd.   BUT... itdoes not open files with scandinavian letters (æ, ø, å, ä, ö.....etc) it simpley gives an 'item not found' errormessage. It cannot open files within a folder containing the same letters. This error comes everytime one try to open a file by double clicking it from any filemanager or from explorer. you have to open the folder manually within acdsee to see the files.  In its current state, i cannot recomend it. It has to be available without launching steam, or steam beeing active. and steam must stop logging the time you spend in it, it is not a game.... And of course, devs. please include scandinavian letters...."
2210,Quake 4,This latest entry in the Quake series is a fast-paced arcade FPS that has many different guns and tons of action packed levels to plow through. Also the mods are amazing too!
22100,Mount & Blade,Love it worth playing and buying
221020,Towns,"A very early Alpha of a basic Dwaf Fortress clone. Developers are clearly making a cash grab with the early sale. This is fine if you are ok 'Kickstarting' the game devs but they don't mention the state of this turd at all on the game's page. Further the screenshots on that page? Complete and total falsehoods. Check back in a few months and see if the devs are still releasing updates or if they just take the cash and run. Also, the game forums are full of major league douches. Caveat emptor."
221040,Resident Evil 6,Not your normal RE game but should be given a chance when it goes on sale.
221100,DayZ, Early Access Review
221180,Eufloria HD,This is a great game for nice calm ambient music and total bloodlust. Very re-playable.
22120,Penumbra: Black Plague,"I think that this was the best Penumbra yet in terms of gameplay and story development. The first game set the tone, atmosphere and story really well and ended excellently. This picked up from where the first left off and really took off- the experience was terrifying and yet so fun at the same time. Frustratingly, a bug prevented me from finishing it on my own computer."
221220,iPi Recorder 2,?!
221260,Little Inferno,  this game is so much fun oh my god i love it
22130,Hearts of Iron II: Complete,"I found this game to have too many options to manage properly. As well the battle,war, attack portion of the game was hard to figure out...even with help from interbet forums and personal websites dedeicated to the game, I lost all interest in playing it, after numerous hours spent trying to figure out how to mange the game."
221380,Age of Empires II (2013),the best kek
22140,Penumbra: Requiem,"I felt quite let down by Requiem because I enjoyed the first two games so much as well as really got involved with the story. I did not mind the puzzles in this game and enjoyed the gameplay, but felt that all three story endings were rushed and dissapointing. It felt clear that Frictional just wanted to give the series a quick kiss goodbye and move on to other things, which I thought was a shame."
221640,Super Hexagon,"Super hexagon was fun, it took me 10 hours to beat all the stages and im still playing because it is that addictive. You cant all yourself a reflex master until you beat this game"
22180,Penumbra: Overture,scary af
221810,The Cave,"I always have to force my wife to play a couple of games with me on a boring weekend afternoon. If I get her to it it usually ends up her loosing interest a few minutes into the game. The only two exceptions this didn't happened where Portal 2 and this one. It's actually the first time my wife asked me the next morning when we can continue playing and that she also want to explore the levels for the 4 other characters.  All in all a nice little puzzle game that keeps you thinking quiet a lot in the beginning, but once you learned the mechanics and rules i actually gets easier."
221830,The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles,"If you liked The Book of Unwritten Tales, you will also like this funny prequel. Many negative reviews are because of game crashes, but I managed to get around the Yeti cave crash by disabling the steam overlay thanks to the info on the forum. And for some negative reviwers, the game appears to be too hard. But I managed to finish it in less than 15h on hard mode without any help. I recommend this game for adventure game lovers."
221910,The Stanley Parable,"I was very reluctant to give this game a negative review because I have mixed feelings about it, but ultimately, I would  not  recommend it to anybody else, especially not for it's full asking price. After playing it through a few times, I believe that the game just simply isn't worth the money, perhaps on a very generous sale, but even £4.99 for that matter is a bit of a stretch. While I really admire the concept behind  The Stanley Parable , which is what drove me to purchace the game in the first place, I personally found it to be dull and disappointing.   The Stanley Parable  has lots of positive  (yet, unhelpful)  reviews, which ultimately leads anybody to believe that it's a fun game, that is the main purpose of a game, right? Unfortunately for me, the game just didn't live up to the expectations set, so I am relieved that I didn't end up paying full price for it  (£9.99 in my case) , if I had, I'd certainly have felt cheated, let me elaborate.  The game itself is appealing because it is genuinely interesting and refreshingly different, the trailer and the highest rated user reviews don't really give much information away because it genuinely would ruin the experience, but all in all, this is not a  game , it is a  lecture .  The Stanley Parable  attempts to convey a message about game design and the illusion of choice, and while this message is conveyed well through the narration  (great voice acting)  it is in no way a fun experience. Sure, some of the dialog can be amusing, but that for me is the only positive factor.  There is no real gameplay and there are no real objectives,  The Stanley Parable  offers nothing more than a few hours of exploration around repetitive and dull scenery, waiting for the next line of dialog to pop up more often than not. I can't speak for everybody, but having to sit and listen for instructions on what to do next is not my idea of a fun experience, and even though the project is very well made and has a good concept behind it, I believe that you would have had the exact same experience just watching a play through of it.  Fans of the game tend to use the argument that if you don't enjoy  The Stanley Parable , it's because you don't understand it, which I'm afraid is simply untrue. I understood the messages conveyed and I think the idea and crafting behind the game is clever and very unique, but all in all, I regret spending money on a  game  that turned out to be an  unsatisfying lecture . The reason I buy games is to have a fun experience, and unfortunately I didn't achieve that at all playing this one.   I firmly stand by my suggestion to avoid paying the full asking price for  The Stanley Parable , but again, it's all down to choice. If you do feel compelled to buy it regardless of any negative reviews in favour of the (mostly) vague positive reviews, don't expect any actual fun gameplay, because I honestly believe there isn't any to be found here.  Please note that this review is purely my own thoughts and opinions, so I know there will be people that agree with me and certainly others that do not. If you are one of the people who purchased this game and felt that you had spent your money well, then excellent, I'm glad that you enjoyed the experience more than I did."
22200,Zeno Clash,"I don't really know how to explain what makes this game so amazing, besides that it's just unique in many ways."
222140,Puddle,Immerse yourself in a story about coffee filtrate. Watch as you change from water to oil to explosives to ink and some other fluids. Oh and at one point you are pee.
222160,"Hamlet or the last game without MMORPG features, shaders and product placement","Finished in 90 minutes with more guesswork and trial and error than clever deduction. A bit dissappointing, I was expecting more from this game."
222180,Mushroom Men: Truffle Trouble ,Generic puzzle platformer with no depth to it whatsoever.
22230,Rock of Ages,"Rock of Ages is a unique game with more to offer in fun and challenge than you may expect. I really enjoy its silly sense of humor. That sense of humor takes the edge off of what would sometimes be too frustrating of a challenge. The game starts off relatively easy, but the difficulty ramps up quickly.   I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I imagine it would be alot of fun to play this against a friend or family member.  I would definitely recommend this game. It's a nice, unique addition to your games collection that probably isn't like anything else that you have."
222420,THE KING OF FIGHTERS '98 ULTIMATE MATCH FINAL EDITION,4 me the best title from the kof series
222440,THE KING OF FIGHTERS 2002 UNLIMITED MATCH,"This game IS the best installment for KOF purists.  Pros: - Strict and satisfying combat. - Great cast. - Amazing soundtrack. - A lot of bosses/sub bosses to pound into the dirt.  Cons: - NOT noob friendly(This has more to do with the fact that this game is a 'frame fighter', not bad game design)  Great game."
222480,Resident Evil Revelations,"A port of the best Resident Evil game in the last 10 years, made better by the fact you can now enjoy Jill's ♥♥♥♥ in 1080p and 60 frames per second."
222500,Rail Adventures - VR Tech Demo,"This is one of the better looking VR coasters I've seen. The keyboard controls are unusual, but most coasters don't give you any control over speed (or the ability to jump), so it's understandable for a tech demo."
222520,Champions of Regnum,"Huge landscapes with variating enemies! Exciting PvP and huge epic wars! ALOT of playtime! A perfect game for players who likes to see their character grow from nothing, to a legendary character! I've played this game through the original client before it came out to Steam, and even now i plan to play it even more!   10/10"
222640,Aarklash: Legacy,"If the pathing and AI in this game wont make you want to hang yourself, the dialogue will.  Theres both too little and too much micromanagement. It sounds cool on paper when you are writing the idea:   'We are going to make an aRPG that has a mechanical focus on positioning'  Then three battles in you figure out you just about exhausted your gameplay depth, because theres just only so many ways you can make encounters engaging.  How long do you think can a game based around 'dont stand in the fire' and 'have line of sight' be entertaining?  Yes, just about the length of a WoW dungeon, minus the social interaction, interesting world and two decades of IP.  You cant leave a character on their own for a split second, it will just die. On the other hand theres a handful of spells and abilities and they make the gameplay repetitious and boring.  How many times do i need to prove to this game i have understood and mastered the fact that Wendaloos shuriken needs clear LoS to land, that i need to be far away from Antimagic fields?  Its dull and boring, its the same test over and over, with the most infuriating buggy pathing and AI in any ARPG to date."
222660,Retro/Grade,"Game tutorial seems really clear and simple on what to do. Unfortunately, I 'lose' within a few seconds once the green bullets start flying - does not matter if I am in the stream of green bullets, or not.  This game has a cool idea, but some visual cue is not working for me so I always lose and can't figure out what I should be doing. "
222730,Reus,"The game is fun when you're trying to understand how to get the best set ups and all but once you've played enough of it, it can get a bit boring."
222750,Wargame: AirLand Battle,All I can say is amazing! So intense and the graphics are beautitful.
222880,Insurgency,"Probably the best tactical first person shooter out there! Everything is perfect, just needs a bit better optimization. Also the community here is very friendly. If you played CS:GO you will definitely see the difference. All in all, the game is fun with great graphics and variety of maps. I am loving the game!  10/10 :)"
222940,THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIII STEAM EDITION,I press buttons and sometimes i win
222980,Dead Pixels,"This decent little 8 bit has a Double Dragon with zombies and guns kind of feel. For around a dollar it's not bad, gets very repetitive but all of the old games did."
22300,Fallout 3,"I'm sure this is a fantastic game. But I warn you. If you use windows 10 (Can't confirm windows 7 or 8, but others have said they have issues as well) prepare to experience an extreme amount of crashes and lag. That is if you are lucky enough to even start the game without it immediately crashing.  If this game is fixed, I will update this review to positive.  EDIT: I purchased this game a year or two ago. The performance notice was not there when I bought fallout 3."
223000,7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover,A fun little match-3 game. Now with Steam Achievements.
22310,Rogue Warrior,This game is a guilty pleasure like that bad B movie you watch because its a decent waste of time&gt; Some people are way to critical of this game. To me its instant gadification blow ♥♥♥♥ up stealth kills many different weapons being able to use cover and not to mention the GFX all maxxed out the game looks pretty damn good running locked at 60 fps. So if you can pick this game up cheap and you liked the expendles movies you will get a kick out of this game just dont expect to be blown away by the story but hearing Mickey Rourke spout the most profain one liners ive ever heard its just a bunch of fun
223100,Homefront: The Revolution,Took me 40 minutes to get into the actual game only to get killed instanly. The ♥♥♥♥ went wrong with this game? I liked the idea and trailer and this ♥♥♥♥ is garbage. Dont touch it.
22320,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"After further thought and gameplay i can not recommend this.i would give it a positive review if it wasnt for one thing,the combat.i wanted to enjoy this game,i really did,but the combat is so poorly designed that it ruins the whole game. your ability to hit an enemy is determined by your skill with that wepon,it dosen't sound so bad,but if your skill isn't high enough then you cant hit anything.it leads to you standing there,your enemy one foot in front of you,and you swing your sword (or whatever wepon your using) 50 times and every single time you miss.i have lost count of how many times i am doing every move there is to try and hit them and i just keep missing.i slash,chop,stab,every possible attack and i just keep missing,and the enemy is standing right in front of me! i have been killed by rats,♥♥♥♥ing rats.all because i couldnt hit them.shields are usless as well,since there is no block button your chance to block attacks is also randomized.also whenever you are fighting there is this really loud *CLANG*noise,it is so loud it physiclly hurts my ears and it happens constantly. the only way to actually hit somthing is to level up your skills,only one problem though.to level up your skill with a wepon,you have to HIT somthing with it.but you can't hit any thing in the first place because your skill isn't high enough! it is just an endless circle of bull ♥♥♥♥.the combat is so broken and stupidly designed that for me it makes the game unplayable. also the GOTY edition has all DLC,sounds cool right?until you sleep for the first time at level 1 and get killed by a dark brother hood assassin!and the town guards dont even help you even if you are standing right in front of them!  over all i wanted to like this game,but it is so broken and poorly designed that i cannot recommend this to anyone.you're better off playing oblivion or skyrim instead."
223220,Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams,Basically infuriating. Some regions have weird save points and you have to play a certain part over and over again in case the world switching thing doesn't properly work which is perfect for rage quitting the game and never playing it again. Seemed nice at first and really wanted to like it.
223280,Cut the Rope,Excellent game and worthy purchase
22330,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ,This i a very enjoyable with a rich story and great replayability. it has a lot of surprising plot twists and overall great side quests as well. allthough i liked TES: Skyrim more (because i played that one first at had a bit to get used to since Oblivion is an older game). i think this is a great game and you should try it for yourself.
223330,Sea Dogs: To Each His Own,Overcomplicated.
22340,Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth,It needs to be patched!!!!  Can't proceed even prologue.... Keeps shutting down everytime when I look at the mirror. Why did I paid for this? Can't even play for ten minute! ... Later I passed that prologue somehow but this stupid game keeps crashing.... I give up. Give me back my money!!!!
223410,Perpetuum,"If you ever played Eve Online and enjoyed it but wanted something a tad more casual then this is the game for you! You are in mechs instead of space ships and the skill system is similar in the way that you get points every day to spend, so its still a time progressive skill gain just like eve. I'm enjoying it, specially grabing it during the sale and the plus side is theres no monthly fee!  Now that EVE Online has gone F2P i can no longer recommend this game. Go play eve instead, i can't see the population of this game holding up to that one."
223430,Miner Wars 2081,"Great idea, not that great of a game. if diffrent developers picked this up it would be amazing. But its not polished and does not feel that open. 3/10"
223450,Dyad,"Overpriced, repetitive, derivative. All of the achievements are for challenges (trophies) which are timed in such a way that you basically can't make a mistake or have to start over (RIP average completion rate of library). Controls feel very imprecise for the task at hand. Caused motion sickness for me. Crappy console port with bad menues. Had to unplug other USB devices to be able to use my Xbox controller.  I don't remember how I got this, must have been part of yet another shovelware bundle. Wouldn't recommend."
223470,POSTAL 2,"I'll give 3 reasons why you should get the game: This game will surely bring the laughs as well as the entertainment and violence. The game offers you to be able to pee. I don't know why people keep mentioning that, but it seems to be a source of entertainment. Finally, even though this game is old, it's still addictive as hell. Trust me you gotta try it. If you don't find yourself enjoying this game within like 1 hour or so, then you probably figured this game is not best for you. But MOST LIKELY that is NOT going to happen if you like to ♥♥♥♥ around in an environment similar to Gta. I know it might not seem a lot at first but there is many things to do. You can also play with the cheat codes on. I personally don't use it as frequently though to be honest but, it's there. I like to enjoy the actual game because it is a hell of a fun game."
223490,Blockscape, Early Access Review
22350,BRINK,"'Brink has heart, but the overall package is lacking.'"
223510,Miasmata,I don't like this game
223630,AirBuccaneers,Has potential but is really dead and empty.
22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,started playing this when i originaly saw the fallout 4 trailer expecting some shity outdated game.........this is the best game ive ever bought and i constantly come back to it because i havent seen everything its also intruduced me to the franchise i recommend to play fallout New Vegas once youve had your fill of the capital wasteland (i actually have more hours than my account says since ive played it outside of steam and finished it 1o or so different times with completely different outcomes)
223710,Cry of Fear,"Damn, this game is pretty good. Silent Hill/Resident Evil 2 good. :O"
223730,FLY'N,The world would be a poorer place without Fly'N.
223750,DCS World Steam Edition,"Horrid support, sketchy missile dynamics, they ban people who show broken parts of the planes or the game itself, they updated steam regional prices which made it more expensive than normal currency exchange rate and when there is a problem between steam and dcs what they suggest is stop using steam. Why do you release it on steam if you are going to give no support for steam users I'm definitely not going to buy stuff out of their sketchy website which you get no support whatsoever.  Don't mind my game hour as I've been forced to play it from standalone."
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Experience: Only played Fallout 3 Game boots up, makes character, game says 'Would you like to turn on Hardcore?' And I say, 'Why not?' Now waiting for when the games says, 'Screw you, here's 5 Deathclaws, have fun in Hardcore! &gt;:)'  Edit: 0/10, would play Fallout 3 again."
223810,Ys I,"I didn't really enjoy it. Could not get the hang of the combat, which entails running into the enemy to deal damage. If you hit the enemy head on (your face meets enemy's face), then you will take damage."
223830,Xenonauts,"It captures the feel of the old X-Coms very well. There's base management and missions. The base economy is pretty shallow, however, and there's not really much you can do there. You ahve to guess what the rooms do, as there's no tutorial.  The fighting part of the game is O.K, but after a while it gets boring with the limited amount of equipment and maps. The cover system seems not to be working at all / is random and the vision seems similalrly random. The enemeis can easily one-shoot you, but they're dumb like a sack of bricks msot of the time, sitting in their crashed down UFO, doing nothing whole game.  All in all, if you're feelnig nostalgic, check this out on sale, like I did. Otherwise, wait for XCom 2, like I'm doing."
224040,LocoCycle,Nice and funny. Oryginal concept for kids. Not for PC gamers (does not realy work with Keyboard).
224060,Deadpool,"Im a big fan of Deadpool, and was very excited to play a game staring the merc with a mouth himself. For awhile, this game is everything a Deadpool fan could want... but then it gets old, and what we're left with is a 4th wall breaking, immersion shattering, primitive hack and slash with guns implemented.   Many will point out the 4th wall breaking is part of Deadpools character, and indeed it is... however Deadpool is constantly pointing out that he is inside a video game, making the plot meaningless, the stakes meaningless, the sense of accomplishment meaningless. While that is an interesting look into the psyche of Deadpool, since thats must how he feels about every story he's in, it didnt feel like I was playing as Deadpool, killing baddies and assassinating targets but rather... just going through the motions while Deadpool made me laugh. This was enough for a few hours, but after I was sick of it, I couldnt even bring myself to finish because of poor gameplay.  The combat is extremely lackluster, and of all the Arkum Ayslum rip offs, this one is well below average. Nothing really feels satisfying, your essentially just button mashing the same tired combos over and over again, which doesnt make for fun gameplay.  The story is a mess, partly on purpose for humor purposes, partly because the plot is a video game... that fact we are constantly being reminded of, so its hard to even pretend to care. Characters pop in and out, and we get put on the track to fight a big bad whose plans are humoriously bla bla bla'd over (You litterally shoot yourself in the head rather then listen to what your doing lol) and while it is very funny at times... its still a mess, and not very enjoyable as a whole.  In short, this is a rather funny game... but its not fun. If you are not a hardcore Deadpool fan, Id avoid this mediocre hack and slash."
224260,No More Room in Hell,new favorite game very challenging but so much fun mainly a team game if you work good as a team youll make it through this or if your better alone create your own server and maybe very once in a while youll get someone but youll mainly be alone i got this game today just 5 hours ago and i already have 3 hours on it i reccomend you try this because its free to play and you have nothing to lose to just try it
224300,Legacy of Kain: Defiance,"This game deserves a sequel! It deserves more of it's dark and powerful story, full of twists, still unmatched dialogues and a morbid world to discover.  This is the last masterpiece of the 'legacy of Kain' Series and the Legacy COULD serve well.  But it doesn't. The Controls are clunky and a over-sensitive camera-control will leave you annoyed.  Don't forget the missing controller-port and add a weird key-configuration. Voila: you added the last nail in Kains coffin!"
224340,Fast & Furious: Showdown,this game is so bad let alone the controlls it feels like you are driving a hellcat and let´s not get in to the carrecters being in the wrong cars /like paulwalker in a charger) and the voice overs...oml WHATEVER YOU DO YOU SHALL NOT I REPEAT SHALL NOT BUY THIS
224380,Virtual DJ,"Absolutely USELESS.. you pay for what you think youre getting. and they want ANOTHER $300.00 (or a monthly subscription) usd to unlock the BASIC FEATURES LIKE SAVING SOUND SETTINGS... save your money, Download mixxx, its free and FULLY FUNCTIONAL. I own and operate Freethink Radio, and online shoutcast radio station, Ive been using Mixxx broadcaster for almost 6 years.. VDJ 7 Was an absolute waste of time and money. The other comments are correct. youre better off just getting the free version. This is a total ripoff........"
224440,Folk Tale, Early Access Review
224480,Octodad: Dadliest Catch,"This is by far one of the funniest and most heartwarming games I've played in a long time. The gameplay is goofy, but it didn't annoy me. It's a very short game, so it's not worth the full price in my opinion, but I'd recommend to buy it when on sale. However, there are many challenges to complete, so you could easily play it again and try to get all the trophies."
22450,Hunted: The Demon's Forge,"You know what you gotta do ? You buy this game twice and take a friend. Then you get slightly drunk (Not completely drunk, you still wanna follow the story [IMPORTANT!] and be able to play this) then you play this until you have either finished it or someone is bored (Still gotta finish it! Trust me!). Don't have to high expectation. It's fun and the elves t_its wiggle but you're not gonna be completely amazed.  Well at least not until the ending. If you wanna be really mean to your friend read the spoiler. You'll know the ending though.   You have basically two options. Either you will kill your friend. (Ingame not irl. WTF were you thinking ?!) Or you will have a happy end. How basically depends on wether or not you drank that slack EVER during the game (Like ten hours before, without you knowing it would have that effect. The game is basically like HAHA. Should've read Noname's spoiler). If one you does you will not get a happy ending. The best way to make sure you murder your friend and give him/her a guilt trip that you already knew that was coming.    Don't trust me because I have like ten minutes on steam while writing this ? Well the fact that I can remember an ending of some mediocre game from five years ago should tell you it's worth to play (drunk[ish])."
224500,Gnomoria,"This game was a pretty cool spinoff from Dwarf Fortress. It was actually accessible and a good enough interface to not drive a normal person mad. It was a bit too easy and some system could have used some added complexity, without making the game frustrating or too hard to understand. Then the developer released it and disappeared from the Internet, leaving a rushed release behind his back. I played it a lot, it showed promise, but in this state I cannot recommend it."
224740,Clockwork Empires, Early Access Review
224760,FEZ,"Buy this game if you are looking for 2 hours of solid, decently puzzling and unique gameplay. The rest of your time will be spent looking up guides online and trying to decipher messages in the game that are in a COMPLETELY NEW LANGUAGE. The only way to translate it is to manually do it or look it up online, and in some aspects it is crucial to the game's completion.   TL;DR: 2 hours of fun puzzles, from there on out it's QR codes, new languages, and invisible blocks."
224820,Super House of Dead Ninjas,"This game turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Wasn't expecting much when I bought it, but it's one that I keep going back to. Great for people who like rouge-likes but not unaccessably hard."
224860,Arma Tactics,"Pretty boring game. Let it run a couple hours to get the cards and move along.  As for the achievements, it seems they are, as of today, all broken (they used to be unlockable, but apparently not anymore):  http://steamcommunity.com/app/224860/discussions/0/648817377867746488/?ctp=3 "
224900,Iron Sky Invasion,"Got this game bundled so I paid like 20p for it, was hoping for something realistic and well, got some bs. Physics are horrible in this game, very unrealistic and controlls are bad too. The voice acting... oh boy, this is the first game ever on which I skipped a cutscene - it is SOOOOOO cheesy. And well, the story of Nazis flying of space zepplings and ufo ships attacking spacestations, umm.... I dont thing I need to say anything here. This game is very edgy and cheesy."
224920,Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,"It's a great game, but the controller support is complete garbage for the PC version. Decided to play my PS1 disc instead after spending an hour faffing around with various keyboard-controller programs with no success in stopping my controllers analog sticks from randomly inputting directions even when not bound to anything and keyboard selected ingame."
224940,Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2,"Another trip down Nostalgia lane, but unlike the first Soul Reaver, this one hasn't aged as well.  PROS: +This is the best version of Soul Reaver 2. Besides widescreen problems, the game runs fine at 60 frames a second. +The story continues and, like the first game in the series, it is masterfully written. +The puzzles are pretty good. +You can use the wraith blade whenever you please, which is very, very good--see below.  CONS: +/- The game repeats itself a little too much. You run through the same areas at least three times. It reminds me of the hub-style gameplay of the first game, but it's done much worse. But it pales in comparison to the other issues.  CONS: -This is the worse game in the series when it comes to the combat. It a phrase: It's broken. You have a heavy attack and can block now, nice; but the heavy attack is too slow to hit and the enemies' block does not reduce their health, nor does it ever break. You almost HAVE to use the reaver to kill enemies. The AI is horrible, too, since it will keep striking you without pause, not even letting a single hit in. It gets annoying when the enemies can both block everything you have and instantly 7hit combo you to death. -There are too many enemies. This game obviously has enemy placement that feels copy-paste, almost to the point that I wanted to stop playing.  All in all, this is the worst game of the series, lagging behind Soul Reaver one, and bounds worse than much better Blood Omen 2. I'd only recommend this game if you want to see how the story plays out, but even then, you can easily read a synpopsis on this one (or just the script) and be fine.  "
224960,Tomb Raider I,"I'm going to be blunt, its a game that if you enjoy the serious should play or attempt to play. But i personally played this when it first came out &amp; hated it as much then as i do now, lack of knowing controlls, bad camera movement, bad movement in general, lack of knowing what do to, lack of map (on screen) these are all things that i had issues with at the time it came out but lets face it, its an old game &amp; they were common issues at the time.  So overall, Not for me, A modern version (which i have - i was given them all by a nice friend who knows i hate the game) might be more appealing to me, but im working my way up from 1st release to latest."
224980,Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation,"Tomb Raider is without a doubt brilliant, but I found it hard to figure out which keys would control my actions. I still cant figure out how to jump, in this game. Tomb Raider is not a good game, for the PC because its not meant for the PC! Don't waste your precious time and money buying this worthless game."
22500,Spectromancer,"I love finding little gems like these, bought it for $2.50 during a sale, and it's like playing a semi-dumbed down Magic the Gathering. There's a lot less caveats and nuances to the spells, but still requires a lot of strategy. Also, every round is randomized, so you have to adapt to each battle within a set of your cards (may be a pro or con depending on the player). There is a multiplayer option for this, so pick it up if you like these types of games, and especially if it's on sale. Also to note, there is a free non-multiplayer version on kongregate dot com."
225000,Tomb Raider: Chronicles,I would nit get this for steam if you are useing windows 10 it just not work right just get a ps1
225020,Tomb Raider (VI): The Angel of Darkness,"This is Tomb Raider's definition of a diamond in the rough. This game could have been one of the very best; but is- as ever with a rush-released video game, plagued by the simplest, yet most important pillars of what makes a well-made video game.  I grew up with this game, however until my purchase on PC, I never got even quarter of the way through due to the horridly clunky, unresponsive and extremely accident-prone controls which forced me to resist Lara's sexiness and return the item to its PS2 sleeve for a good year or so. Despite this, the story (if you manage to survive the hours of trying to stop Lara from back flipping off of some rusty scaffolding to her hilariously glitchy death) is incredibly immersive and almost  theatrically  encoded. I found this to be one of those rare cases where I'm not motivated by the amount of fun I'm having, but by reward of finding out what happens next in the story.  The problem is, it doesn't matter how much you play this game, you will never ever ever get fully used to the controls, and in a game where absolutely everything can kill you, it is not acceptable. You have no choice but to overwrite the same save file every ten seconds, not even from paranoia, but from the simple fact that the very next  step  that you take can (and almost certainly will) kill you. No one can deny this, not even the most hardcore of TAOD players.  If you are short-tempered and only in the market for a smooth, forgiving experience, then I suggest you think a while before making this $6 gamble.  However, if you are either a die-hard Tomb Raider fan or an extremely patient, committed gamer, then you will certainly be rewarded with a thrilling story, a gut-wrenching ride and the open arms of a rather covert, but very existent community of TAOD lovers.  Just remember that the fun will begin only after the game has been sated with your torture."
225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"Great game, short but engaging throughout."
225160,Shadow Warrior Classic Redux,"This is a great Chinese-themed shooter, set before girls had showers and drivers had licences!"
225260,Brütal Legend,one of those stories you want to finish the game just to what's going to happen.  the world and the background music make feel in a metal album cover.  It has incredible lore and legends behind the story Full of legends in rock history and easter eggs about rock music
225280,Full Mojo Rampage,"A rogue lite with mutiplayer and fluid gameplay. I definitely think some enemies seemed to hit for a lot of damage, but it never seemed unfair, I just felt really bad at the game, which is probably true. I have only tried it briefly, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing and after my campaign to at least try every steam game in my library I will come back and try to experience everything this game has to offer. Easily one of the best games I picked up this steam sale."
225300,Tomb Raider II,"Tomb Raider 2 is undoubtedly the best old game of the Tomb Raider franchise done. The first game was revolutionary but overly 'square', and Tomb Raider 3 had better graphics, but it was very difficult and 'more of the same'. Tomb Raider 2 got the middle ground: maintained the essence of the first game with improvements in graphics and gameplay, but without being confused, 'more of the same' and unnecessarily difficult as the third game. In short, Tomb Raider 2 bordered on perfection. While Tomb 1 is visually dark and claustrophobic, the phases of Tomb 2 are more colorful, biggest and very memorable. The four phases of the wreck of Maria Doria are by far my favorite phases of all Tomb Raider serie, for its immersive atmosphere, symbolically and literally. Novice players of this new generation will certainly face major difficulties with the game controls, which are well archaic. No movement is automatic or fluid: from one platform to another, all the leaps and Lara moves must be calculated accurately by the player himself; otherwise it's instant death. The good news is what the PC version is possible to save the game any time you want."
225320,Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft,"The last good game of the orgininal timeline of Tomb Raider, in my opinion of course."
225360,DARK,"As far as this game goes, I don't know where to start... so maybe I'll start with the pros  PROS - Great Atmosphere - Innovative approach vampire gameplay - Vampire skill tree  CONS - Stiff and clumsy movements and controls - Dumb AI (Also, forget about hiding again once you're spotted, because the guards will keep discovering corpses. Hell, they'll pull corpses out of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s just to stay in HOSTILE mode.) - Inconsistencies in skill tree (Some abilities are pretty much either literally useless or do the same thing as others in a slightly different way)  This all being said, the idea of the game is amazing and what it could have been awes me. I'm saddened to see it be killed by controls as listed above. Lanky, stiff, clumsy, and unplayable almost. It's like this game never got out of alpha."
225420,Cities in Motion 2,"Oh, I never wrote a review for this game?? Well I have 180+ hours in this game hmmm, lots of negative reviews complaining about really weird things.  So one guy on here complained about Metro tracks and space and to sharp of a turn... umm seriously? How tight are you making the bloody track lmao!!!  Another person complained about the decision to bring vehicles back to depos at the end of their trip. In which case, where else would they go? The way vehicles degrade in this game it almost impossible to run a vehicle on a line twice or more, unless your line is so small that it pointless to even put together as it not going to generate money.   So yea... I don't really understand the hate for this game. I like it, it runs just fine at 5760 x 1080 resolution.  Not sure what people are expecting in a transit simulator, but it plays like a transit simulator. So +1 for that??"
225600,Blade Symphony,"My friend bought me the game, played with her for half an hour, logged on another time and destroyed an entire server.  4/10 kinda weird controls and mechanics but if you get them then, go ahead, probably better if you practice. Seemed a bit boring to me"
225640,Sacred 2 Gold,Boring and not worth it
22600,Worms Reloaded,"It is Worms with decent graphics and fun sounds. Game is great fun, but only partially supports controllers which is disappointing. If you're OK with swapping controllers, then it can work OK."
22610,Alien Breed: Impact,"WARNING TO AMD USERS!!!  It seems this game is not at all friendly towards players with AMD GPU's. I had trouble launching the game and read the discussions and realised that all the people complaining were AMD users. The game uses PhysX, which is a Nvidia product and that is what is causing all the trouble.  If you plan on buying this game, pray that you are lucky and that it works on your PC. Otherwise you are in for a hell of a lot of bug fixing to get this game working. I was busy for 3 hours try to fix it and I still couldn't get it running and gave up on it. That is why I am giving it a thumbs down."
226120,Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space,"This game is poorly executed. The ideas are good, but the game falls flat. There is little information to help decide what upgrades will benefit you in your missions. The 'economy' is pretty much useless. It's just a bad game with nothing to hold your intrest beyound a few minutes."
226320,Marvel Heroes Omega,"Let me tell you a story, I love this game, and so I decided to try one of my favourite comic heroes out since I had finally gathered up enough Eternity Splinters to buy him, I bought Deadpool and quickly got him to level 25 mid Terminal (solo/group content available from level 20+), it was one of the current One Shot Story Terminals, which takes place at the Bronx Zoo, and I had been particularly gun-happy in my build for Deadpool, and then mid mission it happened, the funniest thing I will ever type, I shot a tank cannon shell up a Lizard-Rhino's ♥♥♥. It happened so quick and in the middle of an intense fight so it wasn't immediately funny to me, but once the fight ended, it was there in my head, Deadpool had teleported behind a Lizard-Rhino and shot a shell from a Tank Cannon up it's ♥♥♥... And that is the story on how Marvel Heroes cemented itself as one of the most situationally comedic games I have ever played. I'd love to hear any stories anyone else has that are comic."
22650,Alien Breed 2: Assault,"Terrible bug in the Escort level that prevents you from finishing the level. An NPC character is supposed to open a door for you so that you can proceed, however the character instead jumps through the locked door and strands you on the other side. You can't do anything other than restart the game from scratch and hope it doesn't happen. I tried 10+ times and the NPC always jumps through the door. What a disappointment!"
226560,Escape Dead Island,"I am a huge dead island fan! but this game was horrible  POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!!! I enjoyed the gameplay throughout the first 80% of the game. it was fun. all the way up til the shadow zombies kicked in. i thought this was stupid and a really bad idea, not to mention this part is so over the top difficult it's not funny. i like a challenging game but there are a couple parts in this that are way over the top.  the story didn't make any since at all. all the teleporting from here to here, waking up here, then there....really stupid story...it was interesting at first but after completing the game and NOTHING is explained? kinda killed it.   PROS: fun graphics lots of weapons zombies combat mechanics are pretty sweet  CONS: (POTENTIAL SPOILERS) shadow zombies....nuff said... the story didn't make any since at all. story was bad regardless if you understand it or not VERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ENDING!! I mean cmon... some parts are hard enough to make you rage throw a $3000 dollar computer cross the room.  if they make an 'Escape Dead Island 2' I probably wont play it.  overall rating 1 out of 10, ill never play this game again."
226580,F1 2014,"When NPC's crash into you, you get a ♥♥♥♥ing penalty"
226620,Desktop Dungeons,Still in my top 4 games after what has been quite a while.
22670,Alien Breed 3: Descent,"WARNING TO AMD USERS!!!  It seems this game is not at all friendly towards players with AMD GPU's. I had trouble launching the game and read the discussions and realised that all the people complaining were AMD users. The game uses PhysX, which is a Nvidia product and that is what is causing all the trouble.  If you plan on buying this game, pray that you are lucky and that it works on your PC. Otherwise you are in for a hell of a lot of bug fixing to get this game working. I was busy for 3 hours try to fix it and I still couldn't get it running and gave up on it. That is why I am giving it a thumbs down."
226700,Infestation: Survivor Stories 2020,"I used to play this game, it was enjoyable and fun to mess around in i even added money to buy ingame items. Recently the servers have been shut down and my money is now gone? i demand that my money be refunded, i am fine with the game not being refunded but my money? that is rediculous."
226720,Lost Planet 3,"Look, I really want to recommend this game.. The story is fine, but it is just too slow paced with too many control issues (and incorrect control instructions) in this cheap pc port to receive any recommendations. Boss fights can be quite exciting at the beginning, but get boring very soon, as you will have to fight every single boss with the exact same QTE method (block and drill) a bunch of times until you beat the boss, only to repeat all these on next boss. It is so cheap and it is such a damn waste of time. In addition, the game only saves when it wants to. For a semi-open world game, this is absolutely ridiculous.   The best I can say is that this is an okay game, and for 5 dollars, it is well worth it, partically because Canadian Dollars went down hill in a rapid speed recently.  Story, 8/10. Graphics 8/10. Gameplay, 5/10."
226740,Monster Loves You!,"Would not waste my money on it. Static scenes. Reminds me of the books that you had multiple endings on and had to choose one. Would be different if there was actual movement. I played it once, beat it in under an hour and could not drag myself back into the game to try other endings because it was so stagnant."
226780,MUD - FIM Motocross World Championship™,Game does not work. It crashes on the race load screen. .......................................................................................................................................................Ok going back and reading some stuff online for some reason this game is crashing on the race load screen for alot of people and the only way to fix it is to turn the audio off in the initial load screen. I guess this game would be alright if it actually functioned and had some kind of support. the graphics are ok and it supports controller play.
226840,Age of Wonders III,totally great way to eliminate dead time
226860,Galactic Civilizations III,Very fun game and great improvement since v1.9 update.
226960,Ironclad Tactics,"Fun card-based tactics game, not turn-based as one would expect, works well though. Good art, nice comic style story, good variety in cards. Definitely deserves better than the 'Mixed' rating it currently has."
226980,Pinball FX2,"Nice Pinball game! BUT, be aware ... do not buy tables with the normal pricetag. Wait for steam sales and a minimum 50% discount !"
2270,Wolfenstein 3D,"Despite Wolfenstein 3D's simplicity, it's gameplay still holds up today. Though be sure to run the game using the ECWolf source port for modern controls and screen resolutions.  10/10"
227000,Primordia,"A promising premise, but the story does not live up to the expectations of isolation and mystery that the trailer purveyed."
227060,Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar,My only issue with this game is the terrible supply mechanics. Supply lines cost too much gold to maintain which forces you to micro-manage your supply routes
227080,Papo & Yo,"Very light and linear puzzler. A fine storyline, but the gameplay is not an engaging enough wrapper for the plot. Not terrible, but not fantastic."
227100,Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army,"Tbh this game is just too awesome and for me kinda scary when you play it alone at night and it feels like u heard something else other than the zombies if u know what I mean lol whatever it is, 10/10 and more fun to be played with friends and full party. Overall, I simply love this game a lot xD"
227160,Kinetic Void,"This game had alot of potential back when it was first put on STEAM, however, since it was abandoned, that $20 was pretty much worthless, and should never have been that expensive to purchase a game destined to be abandoned, or even after it is abandoned. Kinetic void started off as a good game with great potential but turned out like it is today, as many say 'Game is a scam' it more or less is nowa days."
227180,Kingdom Wars,Game should be called 'Credit Card Wars'  could have been a good game p2w ruined it
227200,Waking Mars,"Waking Mars is a relaxing atmospheric educational puzzle/sim game.   One of those sci-fi games that remind you of the feeling you got while reading Asimov for the first time.   Bought it for 2€, got about 7 hours of quality gameplay. Definitely worth it."
227220,Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves,"I have not played this game in awhile, but I wanted to give a review in light of the possibility of increasing its visibility via Steam nominations. I have played no other games in this genre, but many compare it to the Orcs Must Die series. This game combines elements of FPS, tower defense, and RPG wrapped in a beautiful package inspired by obscure history and folklore. Combining Quebecois and indigenous folkloric elements in a mid-nineteenth century milieu, there is no setting like it. This is very refreshing in a culture industry where 'generic high fantasy' is now ubiquitous and passe, often falling back on Tolkien without understanding what makes his oeuvre magisterial and immortal. Some have criticized the voice acting for a lack of polish, but it has a heartfelt community theater style that charms, entertains, and fits this project. The stakes and tension in the story grow steadily to fever pitch, and the cliffhanger left me wanting more immediately. There are several mechanics and ways to play, so you can experiment with different styles-guns, potions, traps, magic-in each playthrough. The tight time and resource management in some missions and the overall arc heightened the sense of excitement and urgency and the need to engineer a perfect defensive strategy. I preordered it for $13.49 years ago and still believe it would be worthwhile at even twice the price. It is just that fun and unique. The only real criticism I have is that the game is not well optimized and is slow to load initially, but I think it is a triumph when considering the time and resources available to such a small team.  I very much hope more attention and sales give the developers the wherewithal to forge ahead and make the sequel this game so richly deserves."
227240,Construct 2 Free,awesome but I really don't want to pay 100$ just to share this game to my friends.
227260,DisplayFusion,I recommend this if you use multi monitors you will like it. Alot of tweaks to move around your applications within different monitors. There are a bit of learning curves but once you figure it out you will love it. Developer are very active and listen to customer input. Thanks for making life easier for people who use mutli monitors.
227300,Euro Truck Simulator 2,"I liked this game, but I can't play it on my computer. It crashes with a black screen and a blue screen with a sound loop, don't waste your money on this game. Also for those of you who think my computer is not good enough to handle the game, these are my computer specs. i7-4690 16GB Ram GTX Geforce 970"
227380,Dragon's Lair,"Nowadays, this is more a museum piece than a game. If you were alive and played the game when it was in the arcades, you were no doubt brutally robbed of all your quarters as you tried to advance. But the temptation to see the next crappy cut scene was too strong; you kept feeding the machine your hard-earned quarters (back in those days, you only got a quarter from the tooth fairy for every tooth you lost, so this was a big deal.)  Decades later, you now have the chance to complete the game in all its glory. Children, stay away; trust me, you won't understand."
227480,God Mode,Game community is dead. Not even recommended even if you have friends who play it since the game doesn't work for quite a lot of people.
227560,Scourge: Outbreak,"I love the way Indie games growing. This game isn't so bad, it was my first game in Steam in 2010. It's kinda trash, but I buyed a 4-pack with my friends, then we just played it for a couple hours. It was fun! I can't say nowadays that I'd spend even a 3$ for this, but its free for whos already have the original game. Maybe, you'd try to find very low price on the sale. One of the thing I'm glad to see is the languages. There is even russian. Another one thing is 4-player coop. I know, the developers just wanted to see their game awesome, but, you know, the graphics is like in 2010, (hi-res textures, wut?), gameplay is boring (shoot-cover-shoot), an awful scenario (and classes? lolwut, ♥♥♥♥♥ please) THE GAME KINDA 'GEARS OF WAR FOR 2 DOLLA' So, now, in 2014, the nostalgy comes back.   5\10"

227760,March of the Eagles,"Honestly, when you compare it to other Paradox Interactive games, you feel really bad this game didn't sell.  Gameplay is awesome, performance is smooth and incredibly optimized, visually it is beautiful, the time period is one of the most fascinating in history, and the UI is clean and easy to navigate.   Some love like hotkeys, more releasable and playable nations, deeper mechanics for diplomacy and internal politics, and an expansion of the time period would've done this game wonders.   A true and, sadly, forgotten gem from Paradox Development Studio."

OH, you will also have to pay for ammo and repairs for your gun. I mean, you could grind for 60 hours but it is easier for me just to inhibit your ability to do anything cool by hiding everything behind microtransactions."
2280,The Ultimate DOOM,"***My actual playtime is much, MUCH higher. I play through source ports off of steam, and I play DOOM + DOOM 2 all the time***  ***BTW you don't need windows. You only need the wad file then you can copy that into a source port and play on Mac/Linux***  When people tell you about how great DOOM was there may of course be a bit of nostalgia (because they grew up with it), and there are some people who would tell you the game hasn't aged well. Well those people are idiots.  I never played DOOM back in it's heyday, I wasn't born yet. My first experience was on the xbox with the Doom 3: BFG edition when I was about 12 or so. I wasn't aware of the legacy behind it either, I just remembered seeing an strategy guide for the game in a thrift store and thinkihg that it had the coolest artwork ever and I kept the name in the back of my head until I would be able to play it. I was mildy irritatted that you couldn't look up or down/jump, but it was still awesome, and I played the ever-loving crap out of it until completed. And this was after I played some more 'modern' shooters like Halo, ETC, but I still preferred DOOM. Halo was slow and I had to be consistently hiding to regenerate shields. DOOM was fast, fun, and had secrets on every level. I could speedrun through a level, or I could take my time and kill every monster, and look for secrets. And I recently have gotten back into it. It really is one of the best video games ever, and I'm telling you this from the perspective of a 20 year old who grew up with shooters like COD, Halo, and Battlefield, It's not just middle aged people looking back with rose tinted glasses. It really is that good. It's even better now that recent games have to try to be the next COD. You should absolutely buy this game unless you are one of those pretentious whiners who complain if there isn't a cutscene in between every shootout. If you want a good narrative, seriously, go read a book. DOOM has what it needs, and honestly the game benefits from it's lack of plot development. I don't want to sit there and watch some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t narrative about the horrors of war before killing a bunch of dudes.  When you go back and play DOOM or any of the other retro FPS games you will pretty much see how far backward the First Person Shooter has gone. The devs, give you a cleverly crafted level, the tools to complete it (but you have to find them!), and say have fun. None of that pointless hunting/crafting, no leveling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just you up against the spawn of satan. The sugar-sweet ♥♥♥♥ of heavy ordinance and fun are your only incentives to play. Murder is it's own reward.And perhaps best of all, they weren't tailored to 13 year olds who can't take a challenge and will threaten to have you permabanned from xbox live for headshotting them.  On a completely different note the game has a large amount of modders that are still active to this day, and I myself enjoy making maps/modding it.There is literally over 23 YEARS worth of fan made content waiting to be played But if you do buy this be sure to grab a source port+ ZDL. Source ports will allow the game to run natively on modern systems and give all sorts of features+ better control options. I I bought them on steam and just copied the wad files into a source port. Here's a couple of awesome ones.   http://gzdoom.drdteam.org/    http://zdoom.org/News   ZDL:  http://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDL   A resource for modding:  http://zdoom.org/wiki/Main_Page   Some good Mods/Wads for your pleasure:   http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/project-brutality   http://www.moddb.com/mods/demonsteele   https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/s-u/unloved   https://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/87784-ancient-aliens-rc3a-available-aa-tex-v1-available/   And also DOOMWORLD for an active community and modding resources   http://www.doomworld.com/  Have fun!"

228260,Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes,"This game had potential, but there is no excuse between the expansion and the original game for all the glitches and poor optimization that still is present. Units that glitch and die because there is 'no space', really wacky and unbalanced units, difficult to navigate consequences (permanent injuries without healing), and the hard to use interface ruins it. Since there are so many better 4x fantasy games out there, I'll stop playing this one now. Stardock did a poor job with something with so much potential. I recommend AoW instead"
228280,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"Years later, I can attest to the high replay value of this game. The enhanced edition adds to this with the new characters and sidequests. I've yet to start the Siege of Dragonspear dlc, but I look forward to the new content."
228300,Remember Me,"TL;DR -  The Good: Interesting concept, good story The Bad: Awful Controls, bland gameplay The Ugly: CAMERA! -  Remember me has a very interesting concept. Man has merged the brain with computers, and people can share, erase, and in the case of our protagonist, change memories and feelings. You play Nilin a specialist in hunting down memories. The setting is a futuristic Paris where most of the population lives in a slum, and the rest in a utopia.   I enjoyed the story in this game, even if it got a little predictable in the second half. The game offers extra story in the form of journals you can pick up and read, but which I found to be long winded and tedious to go through, so I just stopped caring about them(As opposed to Watch Dogs, where you get brief audio logs that I've never failed to listen to.)   The graphics are crisp and clear for the most part, and my fairly high end AMD machine had no trouble with frame rates at all.   Combat was more rhythm based than anything else. You build up combos, then press those buttons (with the occasional dodge thrown in) timed right, you do more damage, and gain bonuses to timers and health. Once I had a good timer reduction combo, the game devolved into Use special, combo, use special.   Moving around levels was more akin to an interactive movie than a platformer. If Nilin wasn't near THE ledge she needed to climb up onto, she couldn't jump more than 6 inches off the ground. The HUD would point to where you needed to go, you go there, press action key...done. There were 2-3 movement puzzles that require you to press the 'shuffle sideways faster' key. And then that mechanic was ignored for the rest of the game. There are hidden little boosts half of which were easy to find, the other half easy to miss. If you miss them and you want to go back for them, you have to restart the level. So, I didn't 100% this game.   Controls...control are where this game suffers horribly. I tried both keyboard+mouse, and Xbox 360 controller. Neither was what I'd call good, and each had massive areas in which they were frustratingly horrible. Certain fights, you need to point away from the enemy, and activate various environmental controls. This was 'throw you controller' frustrating on the controller. Nilin would turn and point at EVERYTHING, but what I needed to hit. On the K+M, I didn't have this issue at all, but when you're required to move objects with a hack, I would be doing the old swipe mouse, pickup, return, swipe, MANY times to move objects incredibly slowly.   On top of the control issues, the camera control was HORRENDOUS. Many, many times I'd would start a fight, only to be looking at/through/into a wall while trying to finish a combo. A few fights in narrow hallways were mostly guesswork, as every time I hit an enemy, the camera would fly into a wall.  Overall, this isn't a game I could recommend at all. I think it would make a pretty good animated movie, but I'd save the $6 and wait for something else.  The Good: Interesting concept, good story The Bad: Awful Controls, bland gameplay The Ugly: CAMERA!  $2 out of $5 &lt;--New rating system? Do you like it?"

228400,ACE COMBAT™ ASSAULT HORIZON Enhanced Edition,"I have been an ACE Combat fan since it first came out on Playstation. I purchased the very first ACE Combat game, and about 4 of the games that it released after that. It used to be a great game.  This game is terrible. Graphics are nice, but the controls and gameplay are terrible and ruin this game.   It was a complete waste of money and will be the last Ace Combat game I ever buy.   Well done for destroying a good game by trying to be clever."

228960,Skulls of the Shogun,"For me it`s really surprising that the game is so unpopular. Like everything about it is soo god, characters are interesting and well-thoughtthrough, atmosphere is very cozy, humour is specific, but nice, and gameplay is like nothing else. Rounding it up for me it was 10/10. Now for the russian audience: Я реально не понимаю: почему игра такая непопулярная, в ней просто чудесно все: персонажи, геймплей, атмосфера, шутехи. Одним словом 10/10 "

229580,Dream,"I really like this game but I hit a gamebreaking bug. I like the graphics style, the puzzles are interesting enough, and there's good atmosphere. However, the game is a bit janky with a few awkward problems like key bindings and no controller button support. Gamebreaking bug I hit was the language switching to French and then to Russian. I can't read the cyrilic and so I just can play anymore despite wanting to. The language setting in the menu still says English despite beign written in Russian. Can't reccommend, even though I want to."
229600,Bientôt l'été,"Odd title, knew it going in, so no complaints really. I'm going to go ahead and thumps up the game simply based on the fact some may very well enjoy this as I did, but it's short-lived entertainment so consider that before buying."
229810,A Fistful of Gun,"Game just didn't work. It looks fun, but I don't know. It would freeze up before I could play everytime. Options screen dropped frame rates to almost nothing. It's a known issue apparently, because I found a page online that listed some things to try to fix the problem, but I don't want to spend 20 minutes trying to fix a game-breaking bug like this and none of the quick fixes worked for me. Just going to ask for a refund instead. I imagine if it works, it's probably not bad."
229870,ShootMania Storm,It is honestly a very solid and good game.
229970,Armada 2526 Gold Edition,"A competent entry into the space 4x4 genre. Has elements of Masters of Orion 1 and 2 as well as the original Galactic Civilizations 1.  One big weakpoint about Armada 2526, which it shares with GalCiv 1 and fails to match MoO1 and MoO2 with, it doesn't have ships that you design yourself. All ships within the game are all preset blueprints which only unlock when the appropriate tech is researched. This means individual weapon and ship components techs are also not used in this game. Eg the weapon tech tree doesn't open up exotic new weapon types like in MoO1 / 2, it just adds buffs to the game's few generic weapon types - all weapon types are there from the start to the finish of every game, no new ones get invented! All there are is a few bland 'Energy Beam', 'Missiles' etc. An example weapon tech effect is 'Increase all energy based weaponry range by 30%'. Ship types are often a bit boring too, just 'Cruiser I', 'Cruiser II' etc. Ships also have no armour or hull structure points, the shields are IT..... once a shield goes down even a .22 bullet will vapourise a Battlecruiser!!!!! (Anyone familiar with the mediocre 'Smugglers V'?) Despite shields being all there is HP-wise, there are no individual shield techs! Just a couple of small ubiqutious and generic shield HP buffs throughout the whole tech-tree! Obviously no armour or hull techs, as I said the game doesn't even accomodate such things, and ships have no 'size' statistics taken into account. There's no engine techs, no targeting computer techs. In fact the whole tech tree is somewhat bland, and smaller than a lot of Armada 2625's competitors.   Maybe the above is because Armada 2526 is allegedly a remake of a much older game, 'Armada 2525' which predates even Master of Orion 1! It's believed MoO1 may even have took a lot of it's ideas from Armada 2525!  Apart from all those weaknesses the game is fairly solid. Don't be fooled by the overall negative tone here, I'm just making sure you are aware of the game's major faults. Don't be put off buying this if you are space 4x4 nut like me, you *will* like it I assure you! And it is way way way better than the godawful 'Horizon' (full price a RIP-OFF at well over £20)!  DON'T pay the full retail price of £14.99 though. Wait for a good 50%+ sale!     PS/ All those good looking screen shots on the store page ARE misleading..... you can get the 3d battle scenes to do this, but the game's UI makes it very tricky to do so, you will not often be bothering getting yourself the kind of eye-candy in those advertising shots!"

I played Dungeon Keeper 1 &amp; 2 for hundred of hours, they were my favourite childhood games. this game has still some nasty bugs and some issues but the game itself is a jewel which people didnt recognize yet. If u loved DK, than this game will be what u were looking for. In my opinion this game is better than DK for alot of reasons. Thank your very much for this game and i would love to see more of it &lt;3"

I have always been a fan of RPG games but i have never tried a turn based game before but I am a massive fan of this one, I highly recommend this to everyone!"
230270,N++,"  I've been playing this game for many years (since N v1.4) and I can honestly say it's worth the time and the money. The concept is simple - you're a ninja, going trough many obstacles to get to the door.  The things that make this game so perfect though are the floaty movement and the smooth game physics. At first you're gonna feel a bit clumsy, while getting used to jumping from a wall to a wall, not being able to complete even the simplest levels.  However, after getting used to it, the whole experience changes. Running so freely, makes the game so addictive and challenging. It's well thought and has a lot of features. There is even an integrated level editor, as well as CO-OP levels perfect for playing together with a friend. I'm defenetly recommending this one. :) A++ for N++"

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is very enjoyable and easy to master. It has amazing graphics even on low-spec PCs! The story is pretty well written, and getting better with every update! 9.6/10"
230700,La-Mulana,"Playing La-Mulana feels like you're exploring ancient ruins, discovering hidden secrets and solving riddles.  Ever get depressed that 'Puzzle' in most games means 'Pulling a Lever' or 'Pushing a block into a block-shaped hole'? The sort of puzzle that can be solved by infants? Do you want puzzles that require you to write down cryptic hints that you'll need to decipher to open a secret passage in 2 hours time from a different location?  Ever get depressed that 'Difficult' in most games means 'Developer was a sadist'? Do you want the sort of difficulty that is hard but not 'wasted the last hour' hard?  Ever get depressed that 'Soundtrack' in most games means 'Forgettable orchestral score'? Do you want the sort of soundtrack that you can actually enjoy listening to. One that adds personality to the characters and the game and stands out rather than blending in?  Then try La-Mulana!"
230760,DIVO,"This came free when I bought FootLOL for a dollar. This is one of the worst games I've ever played because the controls are so counter-intuitive. Holding mouse 1 and 2 make you move left and right. You can also use arrow keys on the keyboard. I haven't used arrows keys on the keyboard for a game since I played PC games in 1997-1999. How do you jump? Not spacebar like in 99% of games ever made. You can jump by pressing, and get this, either the up arrow or click both mouse buttos at the same time. Everything is so counter-intuitive that it made playng the game a chore and the game is not any good anyway."
230780,articy:draft,"This is a nice investment if you're into videogame making... allows you to look very clearly at every detail of the story critical elements, branching, specially to have a very clear and specified way to look at your variables and optimizing these into the smaller possible number. Don't get me wrong, the programming that you may implement in the software is very veryyyy basic but is just what you need.. I and anyone would hate to learn big programming just for a design software that would suck. I've used this for 2 of my biggest videogame personal projects (  https://youtu.be/i-2h3yN_t7Y?t=4s  if you would like to see them) and will continue to use it for further projects."
230820,The Night of the Rabbit,"Where do I begin... This game is ridiculously convoluted in the way the puzzles are designed and the jokes are awkward. It's a shame that there are no real puzzles instead of you just having to find, combine or use random items over and over, because it does get pretty boring after a while. Can't deny that the soundtrack is mostly pleasant (not very memorable though) and that the art style is nice to look at, but those factors don't matter when the game is inherently unengaging. I don't hate this game, but when comparing it to games being sold for the same price I think those €20 are better spent on for example Samorost 3."
230840,Daylight,"  Short 1st person horror game. Collect the scattered letters, pictures, and documents to unravel the mystery. Very short and little replay value once you know the story. It's horror so there are jump scares and the atmosphere succeeds at being creepy, preventing the achievements from popping while playing is a nice touch. Get it if you like horror but only for a small price."
230860,Cannon Brawl,"Love this game and all the componets wish there was harder AI, but other than that its a great game."
230980,Starseed Pilgrim,"If I didn't already own this, I'd buy it again. Maybe I'll gift it to someone?"
2310,Quake,If this game was food then it would be a side dish nexr to Doom.
231020,Storm,"This game is the perfect demonstration why game creators need to be greatly skilled to make good sandbox games. Despite all its visual beauty and tranquil atmosphere, Storm often manages to become irritating by (probably) unintended pitfalls in the level design or the clumsy implementation of its controls. The seed has a tendency to get stuck in places where no element can reach it, and perfectly good puzzles often become sour by the 10th slight off-placement of a wind or a 0.1s mistiming of a lightning. On the other hand, Storm's basic concept is superb, and when none of the above clumsiness happens, it's sheer joy to guide your seed through the obstacles of nature. And, as hinted above, the hand-crafted visuals are a definite hit.  It would be too harsh to unrecommend the game, but I can only recommend it with reservation. If you're patient, you may be more forgiving towards the game's shortcomings, and have a great experience. If you're allergic to unrefined controls, you're probably better of giving Storm a miss.  Edit: ... and then I got to Spring Day 12. Oh my. NOT recommended :("
231040,Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians,"Musical game that you might enjoy if you like the music, but I didn't, so it was very tiresome."
231060,Ragnarok Online 2,Its a great MMORPG for a more casual playthrough of things.Decent class system with multiple jobs and u can swap jobs any time. Dungeons require a party to have any hopes of success .Although the minimal amount of people playing this game makes it impossible to form a party your level. Personally what ruined this game for me was the fact that a lowly noob wud get picked up by a lvl 50-60 party .They wud pull u through maps and different mobs which are way too high level to u and in turn give u too much experience .Before i knew it i was already lvl 40 and didnt know squat about this game with lvl 2 equipment.What the actual ♥♥♥♥ . ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ IM OUT.
231140,Cities XL Platinum,"This is really City-- so city user interface, you can't even use mouse to drag and move around the map. you need to use arrows. want to delete part of a road, it deletes the whole segment (can be very city). rly i was disapointed, I needed way more patience than I have already gave to this game.. it sucks."
231160,The Swapper,"It's probably the greatest 'meh' game you ever come across. If you value 'meh' like i do, you will love it. Everything in this game just screams 'meh' and 'don't bother'. Game got some unique mechanics, but don't be afraid, they're so bland and uninspired that you won't get exited even for a second ! Screw those fancy FEZ, Braid and other masterpieces, get this game, you will be bored the whole time !"

231310,MirrorMoon EP,"This game is worth getting. One of the few titles made with unity that I will happily endorse. However if you can't solve simple puzzles, don't get it and go back to Call of Duty. But then again if you can't solve simple puzzles most games are beyond your grasp anyway. Update: Easily a better game than No Man's Sky."

232090,Killing Floor 2,"  I feel like I've played enough of the game to make a proper review of it, although I will say in advance that I haven't bought it, a good friend gifted me a copy. As usual, I'm gonna start with the negative parts first:  First and foremost, the music. I know some people will instantly bash on me for this, but I will clarify: The music isn't bad. Most of the soundtrack is good, infact. However, does it fit the game? That's debatable. Killing Floor 1 had custom themes for each map, something that helped a lot in setting a cool atmosphere for each map. This game instead plays a random Death Metal theme on your ears for each round, which just seems dumb. If instead they made two sick Death Metal themes that fitted each map (one for the survival part and another for the minute you'll spend running to the trader), then it would help A LOT. The game does have an option to add lyrics to the themes if you feel like, although it seems barely anyone likes them.  Something that also seems weird is the new trader. Remember the old one? Sure she had average dialogue and wasn't really that important, but she would grew on you, you'll get used to her dumb quotes. Now instead you have a french-AI robot that's unable to shut up. It will be constantly treating you like a child, throwing you notes on how to play and what to do, it gets a bit irritating. I have 100 health, why do I have to hear a french robot tell me that 'You need medical attention'? Specially since the trader bot's audio clips will mute any chatter coming from the characters, which is dumb. I'm also not the biggest fan of switching the makeshift shops for weird looking pods, but that does help the gameplay as there's more of them out there and reminds everyone that moving around is better than camping.  Third is something that's becoming a pest lately. Companies kinda need the money to stay in business, thus adding micro-transactions in games is pretty popular. Does Killing Floor handle them well? No. Copying the business model of another game and thrusting it in your game does not always work; it backfired horribly in Payday 2 when it was added, and here it's not much better. From game to game you have the chance of getting USB's that you can unlock for the price of 2$ and a half. And what do you get? A lousy paint job on your gun or a cosmetic item. The cosmetic items are okay, but the gun skins? What the f#ck is this? Most of them look like f#cking Nerf toys! Why not having something like the original game? New characters and maybe some weapons and crossovers? It's way more interesting than making your silver-looking deagle be f#cking orange.  Lastly, while I like that this game has more variety in perks, I think they're alienating for anyone that's not familiar with the franchise. In the perk menu you'll see around 10 perks and the game doesn't really bother much to tell you what each perk does. It just tells you that you'll get a bit more resistance on this, more damage on that, maybe a starter weapon and that's it, you figure the rest. It's quite dumb when you gotta look online what's the best advantage and weak points of each perk because the game asumes you'll figure it out instantly. And the game has a tutorial, why didn't the perk system get explained a bit there?  That being said, the game is surprisingly fun, and has quite the amount of good points going for itself.  First is that the maps, even though there's not that many official ones yet, are good and offer a decent variety. I'm not a big fan of how some of them just feel like an over-sized labyrinth (specially the Catacombs one), but they're okay. They also have hidden collectables to look forward for during the trading stages, although I'm not yet sure what they do.  The shop has recieved quite the overhaul, and I'm glad it did. Between each wave you can spend the weird money you get in new gear or reparing the gear you already own, and it both looks and feels way better than it did on the original title. If anything, I'd just say that some perks need more weapons (or ANY weapon at all, as the Survivalist perk has nothing to call it's own).  The characters themselves are also cool and worth a mention. Sure the original game had tons of them, but they all shared the same voice and felt completely the same. Here though, they all got different voices, different specific cosmetic items and you can customize them a bit. And the voices aren't terrible as I expected, though some characters like the japanese one feel overly clichéd and boring as hell, and the new voice acting doesn't even compare with the purely hilarious voice-acting of the first game. The original one had quite the dark sense of humor, and it was fun. This one seems like it tries too hard to be edgy as f#ck most of the times, with the exception of some characters such as the Knight. I mean come on, I haven't heard A SINGLE CHARACTER say 'Dosh' a single time, that's serious.  The guns and perks themselves feel mostly balanced. Back on the original game you could see tons of people always going as the same class, here it still happens with classes such as SWAT, but to a lesser extent. Though I will say, I've tried a handful of perks when I was starting on the game, and I found the Gunslinger to be far stronger than most.   The vs. mode is also cool. Played it a few times so far and it feels like L4D's vs mode done right. Tons of fun to be had there, and if you do buy it, I totally suggest you gather some friends someday and play it all together.  Lastly, I'm surprised by the performance. I got an outdated PC and the game still runs quite well. It only seems to struggle when someone uses the Firebug and shoots flames all over the place, but it seems noone likes it on this game either.  Do I recommend the game? Yeah. However it's current price-tag for the content in the game might be too much for some, specially if you look at the Deluxe edition, which I don't really recommend at all. The game costs 27€, and I would wait for a sale that drops it, at least, to half of it. The game is way better when played with friends, so I suggest you buy it on a sale if you have friends to share it with, it will be tons of fun. Alone or with random people you might not enjoy it as much, but you won't regret it if you have a decent computer, a liking Metal, you enjoy FPS games and spraying a map on blood seems like fun to you.  TL;DR Edition: Fun FPS-Gorefest, improves much of the stuff the previous game had, though it fails flat in some areas. With friends is fun as d#cks, though you should wait for a sale, not everyone can throw 27€ at Steam just like that."
232430,Gone Home,"What a disappointment. I knew it was story based with little real gameplay (if any), so that is not my issue. Its the story. I may spoil it a little here, but I urge you to read on. The game starts very eerily. Something seems to have gone very wrong and I was itching to discover what happened, Where is everyone? I cant even imagine! But its the reason that theyre gone that sucks so much.  Next I will spoil the story so stop now if you care.  The focus is on your sister, she is a lesbian! Woah! And your parents arent happy about it. They disappeared off to a couples retreat and your sister left with her girlfriend in rebellion. The end. There is a little more to discover about each person, but nothing particularly interesting. The method of unraveling thw story I liked but the story itself is bad and disappointing. The environment kinda sucked (a huge sprawling mansion that went on and on). I enjoyed finding bits of past trivia (VHS, cassete tapes). Dont recommend, definitely not at anything less than 80% discount."
232450,SolForge,"Great game and the idea of transformation as the core makes gameplay fun and entertaining. I split most of my time playing CCGs between this and Hearthstone, which is also pretty great.  Sadly the campaign in this game is incredibly broken. If all you'd like to do is play in online battles, then this game would be great for you as you can obtain great cards and content just playing online alone. However, if you wish to play the campaign it takes endless amount of time to devise a strategy to beat each individual boss. One of the most broken characters in the game is Cercee, who kills you in one hit after about 10-15 turns, every time, unless you have the proper card in your hand to prevent it. While accomplishable, it's infuriating to play against an AI that can defeat you with one card, even if you maintained all of your health up to that point. Each enemy campaign player also has passive abilities that you are never allowed to utilize as well. (I.E. whenever a creature hits you, destroy that creature. Whenever your creatures deal damage, gain that much health. All creatures have aggressive. etc.) (Cercee -&gt; Whenever this creature deals battle damage to a creature or player, deal damage to them equal to their HP,)  It would be far better if they would make a campaign that had a story to it instead of pitting you against incredibly broken enemies instead of fair fights in which they simply have better or equal cards and you need to out-strategize them.  Sadly, in the campaign's current state (which is half the point of the game), I cannot reccomend this game to someone who is looking for a game to enjoy without requiring them to play against other people that will probably be willing to empty their wallet into getting the most OP cards."
232750,Mars: War Logs,It's ok.
232770,POSTAL,"I love this game. And for people complaining about graphics and controls, just remember it was made in 1997 "
232790,Broken Age,"Deep narrative, interesting characters and CRAZY plot twist. If you like any of these features in a point and click, pick this up."
232810,Godus, Early Access Review
232890,Stronghold Crusader 2,"A huge disappointment compared to the older games in the series in almost every way. Honestly, just stick with one of the originals."
232910,TrackMania² Stadium,"I spent half an hour just trying to figure out the horrendous user interface of this game. I am being completely serious when I say this is probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game, period. It is completely impossible to figure anything out. For some reason the main menu is a browser. For some reason browsing costs in-game currency. For some reason you can send mail, which also costs in-game currency. The server browser is a joke, the controls are an even bigger joke (♥♥♥♥ing arrow keys, are you kidding me?!)  Whoever was in charge of designing this piece of crap UI, please find a different line of work that doesn't involve designing anything ever again. Your handywork made me refund this game out of pure frustration within 30 minutes. Congratulations."
232950,Bridge Project,"This game is hot garbage, get poly bridge instead."
232970,Thunder Wolves,Shoot'em up where you drive a chopper to blow stuff up and rescue people. Some rail shooting to spice things up. Lots of late 90's action dialogue. WASD + Mouse recommended.
2330,Quake II: The Reckoning,"[played with ultimate quake 2 patch containing KMQuake2]  Base game refuses to be played in 1280x1024 so i fiddled around with mods and ended up with kmquake2 which allows adjustment of fov and some new graphics and GUI options.  Most of the new enemies are just rearmed and re-purposed old ones; most of the new guns and items are not functionally different from the old ones; all levels are as brown-grey boring corridors as in the base game. New LD features even more pointless and unclear obtuse backtracking, with tonal and at the same time logic dips, but for some reason this game feels less boring than the original, while being not that much shorter. Maybe it's just consequences of the 'cultivation'.  So it's pretty mediocre, fans of the first game should like it. I didn't like the sequel and this one isn't that better."
23300,Yosumin!,"Creative idea, however actual gameplay on certain boards (in adventure mode) is very heavily luck-based, and there's just not enough charm here to make replaying the same boards fun/rewarding/interesting beyond 2-3 attempts.    "
233110,Defense Technica,i can win defence grid 2 on all levels and custom maps on hard. BUT this game just way to hard.  i find i can not make beyond wave 5 but no farther.  even though i got it on sale for $3 it was a waste this game really sucks i shpould have listened to the other negative reviews they were all correct
233130,Shadow Warrior,"Just dissapointing. The humor and the setting are very cool, no question, but the game play is very boring and uncreative."
233150,LUFTRAUSERS,"The game is fun, but very hard. It is also quite flawed in a major way, wherein it does not run smoothly. For a 2D game with basic graphics running on modern PC's, that is kind of stunning. Every time your ship is destroyed, the game stutters for pauses for a moment. This really detracts from the live action arcade feeling of the game."
233190,Final Exam, The main issue is regarding the Combat Mechanics.
233210,Air Conflicts: Vietnam,"Great arcade flight game! I'm sorry, but there´s no 'simulator' about this game, but it´s fast-paced, fun and in Vietnam! That´s just awesome!"
233230,Kairo,"Vaguely creepy, very surreal, a good game. Weird but good."
233250,Planetary Annihilation,Titans expansion is deffinitly bullsh*t. Selling a expansion before a game has met it's expectations is just disrespectful.
233270,Far Cry® 3 Blood Dragon,Finger of death!
233290,MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT™,"So far unimpressed with the story and gameplay. Checkpoint system utterly broken (go on, solve an entire case, find a bunch of clues for another case, quit the game, load, realise NONE of the progress was actually saved). And of course 30fps lock in v-sync mode."
233310,Avadon 2: The Corruption,"Nice indy game, decent story, combat can be a bit dull at times but it's a good bang for buck."
233350,Sudeki,"Horrible graphics, annoying gameplay, horrible writing, and basicly lame."
233370,The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief,"its an insteresting police mistery point and click game. too bad its riddled with bugs all over the place. the end was quite obvious, though."
233410,Final Hours of Tomb Raider,"Good content for game designers and fans. Very poor interaction, art and usability."
233450,Prison Architect,Awesome have been playing for like 13 hours and it still didnt got me bored!
233470,Evoland,"Evoland is a novel title, but that is about it. The game is very short and railroaded through. They are basically no choices that affect anything in this game. Worst of all is the game-breaking bug that prevents you from accessinmg half of the map if you exit the forest to the north after going in from the south (iirc). Do yourself a favor and just watch a playthrough instead."
233510,Lunnye Devitsy,"A short platformer set in an open world void of hazards. It's all about exploration, finding all hidden trinkets and all the endings, as well as letting the peaceful, mysterious atmosphere sink in.  Controls are tight and there really isn't anything wrong with Lunnye Devitsy aside from some endings being too obscure to be found without a guide, one (optional) passage full of invisible passageways that can make you tear your hair out and some (also optional) platforming sections that require extremely precise inputs.  So overall it's a solid recommendation unless you are a perfectionist (in terms of achievements and secrets) that can't handle a bit of frustration.  It's certainly a unique game in an over-saturated genre and especially perfectly suited to anybody who, like me, loves to occasionally explore a game world without having to worry about enemies."
233530,Wake,"This is an extraordinarily bad game. Like this developer's other contribution Lunnye Devitsy, it looks awful, plays awfully, and wastes the player's time with frustrating controls and obscure map design. You will live a slightly happier life if you never install this."
233550,Another World,What a classic!
233610,Distance, Early Access Review
233680,Black Ink,"I like Black Ink, it's fun to mess around with brushes. I'm an amateur artist so I can't give any technical advice or information, but as a hobbyist I quite enjoy it."
233700,Sword of the Stars: The Pit,"It's hard for me to say whether I do or don't recommend this.  It's a real rogue-like on steam, with graphics, animations and sound that give it good presentation compared to the many freeware ones that domiate the genre. At its core it plays as a good rogue-like but I felt like my character was slowly being drained down of ammo, food, equipment durability and the like without the normal feeling of growing more powerful, unless you get lucky with a good weapons. Speaking of feeling very luck orientated the game in general seems to love many of the most annoying parts of rogue-likes. Annoying traps, enemies and status effects can cripple or kill a character. It gives a lot of in-game information but also fails to provide at lot of useful bits, maybe I missed it but I couldn't find what stats do (other than modifying skills). It also failed to make ranged combat very interesting when it is a large part- unlike say DoomRL. Crafting seems a fairly big part of the game but unless you are willing to very slowly build up your list of recipies from accessing computers (but the characters good at that are also the ones that rely on crafting) or just cheat and get them from the wiki you won't be able to craft much. While it is possible to experiment losing failed ingredients and needing access to limited use cookers/labs makes it impractical for anything but the most obvious.  I'm fine with a rogue-like being hard- I've played tons of other rogue-likes with little success, but this one seems just hard in annoying ways, without much to make up for it."
233720,Surgeon Simulator,"While not medically accurate, this game is hecka rad. It's also seriously funny which is why so many of my operations go south."
233740,Organ Trail: Director's Cut,"Took off with my buddies to escape the zombie apocalypse.   My best friend sat on and broke several spare car parts. My roommate got shot by a bandit. Oh, so did my car. A buddy got bit while he was taking a whizz so I sold him into slavery, and apparently my boyfriend can't sit still; he broke his arm and his leg while sitting in the car.  Next time I'll kill them all off and keep the food for myself.  10/10"
23380,Gyromancer,"  Not a bad game at all, theres a lot more to it than i assumed there would be. Like a combo of puzzle and Pokemon.  EDIT: At the time of this review, i hadnt experianced the crashes. After seeing that any minimization of the game causes a crash, I cant really reccommend this game."
233840,Worms Clan Wars,"Day 1, multiplayer doesn't work. Day 2, multiplayer doesn't work. Day 3, multiplayer doesn't work. Day 4, multiplayer works."
233860,Kenshi, Early Access Review
233980,Unepic,"Honestly one of the biggest surprises I've ever experienced with games. I wasn't sure what I was going into, but as it turns out, it was a great adventure, filled with humor, pop culture references, super fun gameplay and an engaging story. I can't think of anynone who wouldn't enjoy this game."
2340,Quake II: Ground Zero,"[played with ultimate quake 2 patch containing KMQuake2]  This is the best version of quake 2: new enemies are great and differ from one another, new weapons are ones which were missing from the base game, like projectile automatic gun (without insufferable wind-down) and chainsaw, and finally we have organic and easy to understand level design, this time with some colours. And unlike first add-on Ground Zero even features new final boss.  Base quake 2 was homogeneous blob of brown-grey levels, had four weapons with the rest being just duplicates or completely useless and functionally only two enemies — one flying, the other is walking. All the additions, including slightly annoying turrets finally diversified the game enough for it to be interesting to play."
23400,Imperium Romanum: Gold Edition,"I have dedicated 60 hours to this game and I can honestly say I have enjoyed each one of them. As a big fan of Caesar III, I have always searched for a worthy successor for that game in this greatly overlooked area of historical City-Building games. Imperium Romanum and Grand Ages: Rome are such successors.  They are flawed, of course, with their poor military control and weak camera freedom. But the quality in the detail, visual and historical, compensates those weak points.  I recommend this game to anyone who is searching for a good city-building title."
234080,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition,"Fixed camera is a mess and killed the whole joy and fun,  "
234140,Mad Max,"I was expecting road rage and mayhem. I got that, but only intermittently, along with a looot of unenthusing cutscenes and never-ending dialogue.   The game looks nice, it's got cars and deserts and fighting and aussies, but I was hoping for some more open-ended gameplay and heavier focus on survival in the post-apocalyptic wasteland instead of what basically boils down to a (bad) WB movie."
234160,Strike Suit Infinity,"TLDR: Crappy controls+Constant crashing on start up= waste of money Lemme start with a simple statement regarding my feelings towards this game. NOPE. I stumbled upon the store page and thought the game looked amazing and decided to buy it, since it was rather cheap. After the installation, the first problem reared its nasty head, being that the acursed thing wouldn't start up. Eventually I had found out that it would crash if my controller was plugged in. I found that rather odd, but was excited that it would finally work and I would have an amazing time. That is, until the game punched me in the face with its controls. It works on a WASD control scheme, which I have no problem with. The problem was controling the bloody ship. I couldn't keep it stable, let alone fly in a stable direction. Every other control was fine, but I couldn;t control my movement virtually at all. It was like being stuck in the litteral middle of the ocean, underwater and all, in a submarine with a rotor on each side, all of which are spinning in a different direction. Also, hope you don't have motion sickness, or else your computer screen will have a new paint job.  "
234190,Receiver,"I have a rule that I will only write reviews for games I've beaten. I've been waiting to write this review for a long ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. I got this game for a dollar or something on a sale a long time ago. I thought I'd be done sooner.  You'll spend day 1 giggling and feeling silly playing around with the guns. When you don't have the help menu open you do silly things. Pull the slide back and eject a bullet then have to pick it up. Eject your magazine from your your gun and grop it on the ground like an idiot. Use the glock on full automatic mode, wasting bullets like a madman, it's silly, it's fun.  Then that starts to wear off. You start feeling like a badass, working your way around the gun like a pro. You'll use the help menu less and less. First you'll master the revolver, in the end you'll finally know what side of the gun the glock's semi automatic mode sits in. You're like James friggin' Bond.  Then that starts to wear off. You start your game and begin mechanically checking your gun from memory. Eject magazine, check to see how many bullets, holster gun, top it off, draw gun, unsert magazine, pull slide if there's not one in the chamber. You've heard every tape by now and understand the story about how 11 tapes will set you free from this reality, you've also learned there's a pause button on the tapes so you don't have to hear them anymore. It's not fun now, it's personal. You don't just hit your enemies, you target cameras and loading mechanisms. Every death you swear, grit your teeth, and prepare to check your gun.  You become paranoid and start checking every corner like the world is filled with snipers who exist solely to kill you....and it is. You learn the turrets actually have limited ammo, if you're low you might even exploit that. You sneak up on flying tazers and catch them off guard. When you hear a tazer spot you there is no fight anymore, you run, run far and fast. You'll come back and shoot it in the back but there's too much riding on this. The route you choose becomes entirely based on how many tazers you need to fight. It's so simple, just finsh 11 tapes and don't die, you could finish it in five minutes but I've been at it for 40 hours.  Then you finish, you slide tape 11 in and you sit back in stunned silence. The game finishes and shuts down and you drop it into your finished games folder. You never need to play that game again, you're done. Somehow, the game was right. Tape 11 set you free.  I regret nothing."
23420,Europa Universalis: Rome - Gold Edition,"Man do I love the concept of this game! It is a wonderfull mix between EU en CK, 2 games I adore in a time setting I love most of all.... Impossible to get working though. Tried it all: patches, mods, the whole lot of it. Can't play more then 20 min if it launches at all. I really hope Paradox makes a EU:Rome 2 or something because I sadly am not able to enjoy this title."

234330,Marvel Puzzle Quest,"Remarkably, this game has gotten worse and worse regarding stability over the last three years. This game was a hidden gem three years ago, was an excellent game two years ago, and was a pretty good game last year. Now the game has become so bad that they recently lost their community manager, and the forums are overrun with valid complaints and frustrated people who are giving up the game.  Customer support for this game is worse than nonexistent. If the game is buggy, expect to impact you negatively. If you have technical difficulties around an item not showing up in your inventory, do not expect any help.  Recent 'innovations' include such gems as 'view a commercial for this in game reward', and new game mode start being introduced are so broken but the game will choose not to award any points for a boss if you do not allow the boss to at least hit you first.  The game continues to raise the level of characters introduced, which means in game currency inflation has gone wild, but the long time entrenched players are still the only ones that stand a chance of winning any of the major prizes.  The game has an alliance concept, which means that in order to get the best rewards, you have to join an alliance with very active players. In a completely non-fun meta game, you can go around forums and find which alliance you should join to maximize your game time ROI.  At one point this was a five star game for me, albeit with bugs, balance and alliance issues. At that time, there was a community manager who intervened when I had some unpleasant customer support issues, and the game was reasonably balanced, fresh, and fairly bug free. People who didn't want to pay to win could still have a lot of fun.  In its current format, the game is trying to milk as much money out of the new players, and as many ad use out of everyone, as possible. The new VIP system means that for $10 a month you can (maybe) be remotely competitive in this free to play game.  In short, stay away."
234350,Luxor 2 HD,This Luxor is pretty fun except there is a game breaking problem with the cursor. When you get furthur into the game the program won't block out your mouse cursor and when you get too far below it keeps pausing the game to no end. For that reason I uninstalled and can't recommend this particular one.

234490,Rush Bros," What I liked:      You can play your own music tracks   What You Need to Know:      Whole music based platforming is not that good     Don't know what else to say, other than get Dustforce instead    My Score:"
23450,Grand Ages: Rome,"Get Imperium Romanum instead.   This game is something like the other Kalypso games you have played (see: Tropico 3), but it is somewhat less approachable than those. The aesthetic (right down to the UI) and economics are very similar to Imperium Romanum, but Grand Ages has something of a story in its campaign mode.   If a building catches fire, nobody will come to put it out: you have to demolish it yourself, and then the lot is empty (you'll have to go into the building browser, select the replacement, and rebuild from scratch).   Building placements are unnecessarily difficult compared to Tropico 3 or Imperium Romanum: farms must be placed on designated patches of fertile land, buildings - all buildings - can only be built in the vicinity of other buildings, so you'll have to build a chain of houses or other structures to that distant patch of fertile land if you want your people to eat.  In fact, so much of what Grand Ages does appears to be an imitation of Imperium Romanum, that anyone who choses the latter won't be missing much by choosing it instead. Imperium Romanum is the better game, so much so that I would recommend buying it and foregoing Grand Ages: Rome.  Grand Ages: Rome is a flawed imitation of a better game."
234530,War of the Vikings,"No Australian servers any more, last I checked. Shame."
23460,Ceville,"A not-so-happily-ever-after fairyland, and a damned fine setting for a classic style point-and-click adventure game. Take up the role of Ceville, a horrid little troll of a king, cast out from the throne on a bizarre and hilarious quest to regain power from the idiots who dared defy him. If Shreck amused you (And I mean back before it fell into the sequel pit), you'll love this game; it's a great sendup of fairytales, legends and beloved stories, with enough pop culture refrences thrown in to make me a very happy geek."
234630,Project CARS,"This is my all time favoritie driving game now, I just purtchased oculus rift cv1 and wow this game is even better and has re-ignited my love for driving games.  When I first got this game I liked it at 5760x1080 on 3 monitors, the game always felt like there was something missing from it, the other gripe I had with it was that I have a cheapish steering wheel a thrustmaster italia 458, the wheel works fine in alot of games and it used to in the first versions of project cars and now it does'nt and I have to resort to UJR to get the full range of the wheel on project cars, the reason for this is that project cars use the xbox driver for wheel, and since then if I just drive with the car I get a very delayed and about 3/4 range of motion on the steering.  SO I have to use UJR to get the full range from the wheel which is a real shame since the wheel cost me about £70 brand new.  that aside the VR aspect of the game is simply awesome and gobsmacking I really do enjoy it and it does fool me into thinking that I akm actually there.  If you have a rift or vive get this game its too good to miss but you need a wheel for it."
234650,Shadowrun Returns,perfect and interesting
234670,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst,"This game was really fun, the fullburst DLC makes you have more fun even though you finished the game, I have Storm 3 on my Xbox and I longed for the day i get fullburst."

234820,Driver Fusion,"i used to like this program when it worked, it worked great. but now appears the devs have taken the money and ran away. hasnt been an update in over a year, when you try to update drivers with it it brings up old out dated ones... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"

234920,Dyscourse,"I really enjoyed that game greatly. Almost killed everyone :D, I liked the music, the conversations, the choices and the consequences"
234940,The 39 Steps,"Please don't get me wrong, I'm all for interactive narratives, but this feels a lot more like a VERY slow-paced Powerpoint presentation that doesn't even let you skip a slide when you're done reading it. Interactivity goes as far as unnecessarily making you click 4 times in 4 different directions just to turn a door knob (as if that would make it 4 times more interactive I suppose?), so you'll find yourself mindless clicking along until you reach the end."
2350,Quake III: Team Arena,"It has been 10 years i have first met with multiplayer fps games and this was the first and so far best impression :)  Quake is a retro awesome fps game with variety of maps and fluid gameplay and hell of a fun. This game is 16 yeras old but still the best playable game of all times IMO. I would prefer this one over CS:GO and L4D. Even with bots, this game has the excitement.  This game contains both quake 3 and team arena games. So buy this one and get new multiplayer maps and new characters. You will not regret it."
23500,Puzzle Quest: Galactrix,"Puzzle Quest - Galactrix   It takes a lot for me not to like a game, maybe it has a cheesy plot or the game is loaded with hackers. The list can go on and on. But Galactrix is a game I really tried to like, I mean I loved Puzzle Quest. This game makes you hate it, and you get the feeling the game hates you right back. I don't mind when I lose but this game takes randomly played moves to a whole new level of 'dude... wtf...?'. It seems they took the core idea of 'Puzzle Quest' and put a space like the spin on it. But so much of the magic is left out and it feels... well hollow. You'll spend most of your time hacking gates, mining and fighting your way through a web of systems that feel generic and plane. The AI is like all Puzzle Quest games, unforgiving to the point where you get the feeling it hates you and your babies.   Here are a few examples of this games logic, just so you know I am being fair.   1. Hacking a gate is a time trial, so you need to match the colors as quickly as you can. Sometimes you'll combo, and you'll start a cycle that just won't stop. This eats your time up and yes you'll combo into the color you need, it doses not happen that often. In fact, it is really rare, but none the less you'll lose to the combo cycle and you'll have to start all over again.   2. Combat is like Puzzle Quest, in fact, it's pretty much the same only everything is lasers and shields. One fight I entered, I didn't even get a single move and the AI made a combo that... with just one move. BOOM! I was dead, he combo-ed into a 203 damage play. I know it seems like I am whining but come on. I didn't even get to make a move, not one single move.   3. When you are on the mini map, or overworld map. You'll sometimes get picked up by people who hate you, so you'll have to either fight the ship or run. I know it doses not seem bad to deal with, but you can get trapped into a cycle that just won't stop. Yes, you can fight but their ships are harder and a little op for just patrol duty. So you'll get picked up again, run picked up again.   Pro – I like mining in this game, it's fun and relaxing. Some of the names of the systems are nods to popular space fairing games. Really, I can't think of anything else.   Con – On top of my top 3 list, the music is bland, the AI hates you, and your family, your families families and every girl you ever kissed plus your mom. The story is really boring and dull. Hacking gates is an over used mini game that is just not fun to play. Enemy ships are always more powerful and better skill then you. Lastly... just random crap that like all Puzzle Quest games, happen for no logical reason.   Verdict – I think the developer had a secret hatred for Puzzle Quest and wanted to get revenge on everyone. If you honestly don't mind everything I had a problem with it, then by all means... pick it up. But I think next time they come out with a Puzzle Quest game, I'll wait on it."
235070,Bad Bots,"Gosh I had a hard decision to make today. Buy a badass sci fi metroidvania actionfest for $.49, or walk around through someone's house for $19.99. Good thing I still remember what gaming actually is. Bad Bots really scratches that sci fi itch ive been having for the past couple of months. The only complaint I have is that the keyboard is not set up for lefties. But other than that, its a good game, with good music and good atmosphere. Something I can devour in half an afternoon."
235210,Strider,Strider is a metriodvania game with simple combat and controls. to be quite honest this game was a little too simple. I was only mashing the attack button and doing platforming the entire time. while yes this game was fun for a good hour or so it got dull pretty fast. Maybe I just gave up on it too fast but this game in my opinon is not worth $15. It's a fun little platfromer with unlockables and combat but thats about it. 4/10
235250,Super Sanctum TD,"Not a bad game but to clear levels on hard you'll need to level up for perk points, more slots and more towers as well as survivor mode you need to unlock all of the ♥♥♥♥ first before you can play the game.. still for its price in the sales its good i guess"
23530,Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,"Fun game, I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad, all-in-all, great game!"
235320,Original War,"Best game ever, crashed only once. Can't turn it off since then. 6.9/11"
235360,Prime World: Defenders,"  yet another tower defense game, but this one looks better then most usually do. the grinding mechanism that other reviewers complain about hasn't really bothered me yet, waiting to see how it fares after a few more hours into it."
235380,Blitzkrieg 3, Early Access Review
235400,King’s Bounty: Legions,This game is fun.
235460,METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE,SLICE N' DICE THEM! I WANT TO KEEP PLAYING JUST TO SEE HOW CRAZY THE NEXT ACTION SCENE IS OMFG THIS IS SO AMAZING. THROWING AN ENRORMOUS ROBOT INTO THE AIR AND CUTTING IT IN HALF. HAVING A PET CYBORG WOLF. ITS JUST TOO MUCH.  AND THE EPIC MUSIC.  - Warning : Not like other MGS Games. This is all out action.
235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"An excellent game that could be even better if they could just address the crashes. At higher resolutions especially, game sessions can almost be a crap-shoot. I have this installed on 4 somewhat similar decent high-end gaming systems, and have done complete wipes and rebuilds of the O/S, the game, steam, DirectX and whatever else may be recommended for graphic/display settings in the company forums - and it just does not stay reliable. Even the DisplayPort cables were swapped on one of the systems, and two of them have had upgraded video cards installed over-time, still.... makes little to no difference.   Gameplay for long-term could use expanded variety in class-types, monsters, weapons, real appearance modifications instead of just hats, and number of item slots. Not sure if any of that is coming, but for duration of gameplay, it better come out soon.   When gunning and running, it is smooth and can pump out a lot of visuals across a good 4-player (human)adventure group.   When there are no humans to join, the AI will leap right in a do a fair job of adventuring with you. Not near as good as a real human, but as a bot they are better than nothing. They are dumb as a box of rocks when it comes to retrieving items (the sole exception being healing items). At times you can fool them into taking tomes, but otherwise - they are just there to shoot things. Generally they will not kill an adventure by doing something totally stupid. They are not really good enough to do the hardest two difficulty settings, but are fun for normal runs.  I recommend the game despite the reboot/crash issues. Its something I have learned to shrug and rejoin another session....  "
235600,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist,"For a game that was released on August 20, 2013 this is still a very enjoyable ride. The voice acting deserves credit, all characters in the game provide genuine performances. Their personalities can easily be seen, i still think Briggs is a tool! The sound and graphics are top notch and all work together flawlessly to provide a very satisfying gaming experience, i was kept hooked enough to keep coming back to complete the single player campaign. The main antagonist was portrayed quite well, although it would have been great to see his real personality earlier in the game instead of only in the final segments.   The controls should be noted, sometimes Sam handles a little wonky, and there can be delays between animations which mess up your timing. I played the entire SP campaign with a controller and found no significant issues with it.  All in all a very enjoyable experience from start to finish. If you haven't played this game you are really missing out!"
235620,Small World,"This game is pretty much perfect. What ever bugs there were... not present 31/12/16. You can even resume muliplayer games very painlessly. Buy this game, it's working great... win10, R9 270X, 8core AMD cpu."
235660,Eador. Genesis,"I played this game for way too long, and I'm not even 5% into what this game has to offer. Hole ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. Take weeks out of your calendars if you want to play this properly."

235800,Audiosurf 2,"Audiosurf 2 has a lot of bugs in Mac OsX. The main screen is so small, graphics are terrible. I recommend Audiosurf 1."
235820,Element4l,"This game is beautiful, original and has an awesome soundtrack. However it is hard. Once you don't click into the flow of a level its just furstrating to repeat a specific sequence. And sometimes you cannot approach a problem with a different combination of elements but only with a good timing.  Unexpectedly hard.  This game is not recommended for a chilly weekend evening. I had to sweat a little. Otherwise it is a really good indie."
235900,RPG Maker XP,"This was the biggest waste of money ever. IT looks so cool and simple to use on the preview but beware! I had to watch TONS and I MEAN TONS of youtube videos just to figure out how to create a simple dialog. If you are interested in scripting video games and are willing to put hours and hours in just to make your first scene, then go for it. Personally I thought it would have been alot easier to use based on the trailer, but I lost 25 dollars and will NEVER play this again. Goodluck"
235980,Tetrobot and Co.,"Overpriced considering it's not a good game unless your around the age of 8 or the parant of one. Game have a serious need of more fun and inspiring mechanics. Controller is more like point-and-click which in RPG's and some forms of arcades is fine or even realy fun, but for this game and it's setting, it's just terrible not to mention that even if u use a 360 (Or similiar) controller, u only change from using mouse-point and click to using the stick to move the mouse and the A-button to move.... 0,5/5 - They did have the concept slightly correct but managed to do everything wrong for it too work."
2360,HeXen: Beyond Heretic,"I bought this game a while ago since I remembered playing it on N64 and it was a blast, it's much different then doom and feels much more complete then doom, unfortunatly I was unable to enjoy this game on pc as the controls we're pretty terrible and the lack of coop/hud/res options we're painful. Now I found out about ZGDoom and I redownloaded this game and it's a blast, make sure you download ZGDoom or another program like this to play this game, it's worth your time and money."
23600,Depths of Peril,"An underrated gem if you can get over the terrible graphics. Diablo-esq gameplay while competing with other AI groups to complete quests and ultimately take control of the town. A lot of gameplay elements here would become staples of Soldak's later games like Drox Operative and Din's Curse. However, the ability to battle and compete with the AI in Depths of Peril makes for a more enjoyable experience than some of the later games. I've played this game off and on since release and keep coming back to it, in spite of the horrible graphics."
236010,Bloxitivity,  decent puzzle game but 11 USD is far too much. wait for a sale
236090,Dust: An Elysian Tail,Very good game for the price. Metroidvania style with a hint of Odin Sphere and questing sprinkled in.
236110,Dungeon Defenders II, Early Access Review
236130,Horizon,"If you like the old style 4X games, and dont mind a dated style interface, I would suggest getting this if its on sale.  Its nothing all that special, but it plays ok, I like the way research works and think it a more realistic approach, the interface is ok, it does not have the polish of more big pubisher titles.  I got it at 75% off, and are happy with my purchase, would not be so happy if I got it a full price, but then most of the recent AAA titles I have got at full price have been a dissapointment, so much so I have not purchased the new MOO, or total war warhammer, out of fear of dissapointment.  If you can get this cheap, and give it a try, I think you will get your moneys worth out of it! I know I am.  about 6.5/10, maybe 7/10 for being indie."
236150,Starpoint Gemini 2,"When I first got this game, I played for about 10 minutes and was disinterested. I really don't know why, perhaps I was a bit impatient that day. About a week later I came back and really got pulled in. I'm 29 hours in now and loving it. The graphics are good, I'm enjoying the story, and I'm also free-roaming all over. There are some quirky mechanics such as ship-boarding that make it a bit easier than it should be, but other than that I truely enjoy this game. I've already purchased Warlords and I am looking forward to how that game progresses as well. Alot of enjoyment here, just spend the time to learn the mechanics and have fun! The developer and the community are great so this has been a good experience for me, well worth the purchase price."
236290,Cranky Cat,"  Grade :  50/100   Difficulty :  Easy.   Pros :  It is a game you can play to waste time if you're bored.   Cons :  The music is irritating, along with the display. The gameplay itself is a no-brainer.   Replayable :  No. I would not have gotten this for myself in the first place -- it was gifted to me as a joke. And that's exactly what this game is."
236370,Interstellar Marines, Early Access Review
236390,War Thunder,"My review of this game is focused on the tanks; I've only played a handful of aircraft matches. And I have to say that in a superficial comparison between WT and World of Tanks, this game definitely comes out on top. There's more dedication to gameplay and detail, the damage mechanics are superior and the potential for individual input in a match is much greater. In WoT you play tier 6 and get into tier 8 matches ten games in a row, GG. WT never takes it's unfairness to this level and overall seems much less determined to crush and destroy it's players.  That said, the game is still trying to destroy you. The gameplay and business model has something fundamentally bullying and wrong about it. I can't play either game for more than ten minutes without raging.  The adagium 'All companies exist to make money, but you don't have to be a ♥♥♥♥ about it' springs to mind. It's not that I mind bullying generally. In PVP for Dark Souls or EVE online there are endless bullies; it's practically the reason people play. But even the maxed out bullies get taken down every now and then, the mechanics and psychology of the game lend themselves to that. There is no such comeuppance in WT, taking down a bully is nothing special.  Gajin crafts an illusion of significance, as is standard for any F2P experience. The mystery box is empty, you're not supposed to 'finish' the game and there is no reward for doing so. You only get rewards for logging in daily and playing one more match. They made their machine and it's working perfectly. They don't even care to cheat. By definition a cheater is still playing the game with you, they're still interacting with you in a meaningful way. Gajin allows for no such interaction. Pay gold or don't, git gud or don't, what's it to them?"

236490,Hexodius,"I can not recommend this game, not so much because of the game itself, but because of retaliation of the publisher to negative reviews.

236530,Hot Wheels™ World's Best Driver™,"worse game ever. don't waste your money! even my 3 years old son didn't like it - and he is very dissapointed because he has a lot of hot wheels car models. poor interface, poor graphics, bad gameplay. too expensive for such quality.  I had to read comments before buying. this game is awful."
236690,Blood Bowl 2,That's what tabletop players wanted. BB of XXI century.
236730,Anomaly 2,"Many are familiar with the concept of tower defense games, where you are building towers to fend off hordes of enemies swarming towards your (insert resource name here). These paths are often full of bends and turns and you must strategically place different types of towers to most efficiently and effectively defend against the baddies. In this game, you are the attackers, and defending are a race of robotic alien invaders who have taken over the world, and you must penetrate their defenses to create and deploy a super weapon to end their threat once and for all.  Your mechanized soldiers form a convoy, which you can deploy in specific configurations and formations to combat the enemy towers. Most of your troops have two modes you can switch between, often close and long range combat modes. You also, as the commander, have special abilities such as the ability to repair your convoy and activate decoys to draw enemy fire, or an emp to shut the towers down temporarily.  Your unit types and enemy tower types are slowly introduced to you during the single player game. Also as a commander, you set the path that your convoy will take, and this can be altered at any time. You purchase up to 6 units for your convoy, and can upgrade them as well using a rare resource which basically acts as money and either is obtained by taking your convoy down a specific path that has it, or randomly as drops from the enemy towers you destroy. The game is fun, and a refreshing take on the tower genre. I wish the enemies weren’t all just chrome, as it gets bland to look at, and makes it sometimes harder to recognize what you are up against since they all look the same.  I’d recommend this game to tower defense fans definitely. There is also a multiplayer mode, and I have no idea what that is or how it works, but every single-player level has leaderboards which you can compete with others for the best score based on time and kills."
236790,Agricultural Simulator 2013 Steam Edition,"The game in idea, awesome. It one uped farm sim in terms of the physics and I liked that.   But in reality.  This game is a failure. It runs like ♥♥♥♥ even on high end hardware and has too many bugs to be considered a fully released product.  I made the mistake of buying this game before steam refunds and even now I can say that whilst writing this review the game isn't worth the $0.99  Don't waste your money. Go buy Farming Sim 2017."
236870,HITMAN™,Disconnections are Agent 47's weakness.
236930,Blackwell Epiphany,"I have to say, I liked the detective work of this one the best, but at the same time, the ending felt rushed and cut. I read that the commentary reveals why. In any case. it's a serviceable ending to the series."
236970,Jack Keane 2 - The Fire Within,"In this sequel to the original Jack learns the reason he's so immature, instable, uncommiting and self centered. He conquers his inhibitions and fears and finaly grows up in a another nice good (if not somewhat predictable) story line. Like in it's precursor there's humor, easy and medium difficulty tasks to figure out and again. Controls are a little bit buggy now and then but not to such an extend that it really hinders the gameplay. Solid old school adventure game for the die hard fans of this genre."
2370,HeXen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel,I grew up playing Hexen on the 64 and was too young to understand the story and how to play so I just used cheat codes to enjoy the game. This is like the master levels for DOOM and puts you right into the action. A great challenge even on the normal difficulty! Great game for an amazing price!
23700,Puzzle Kingdoms,"For fans of Puzzle Quest, this is a new and interesting take on the game. Very similar, but unique enough that it doesn't feel the same."
237310,Elsword,"Although it is a free to play, due to how much it restricts the player unless they pay for the items (and no you can't even use in-game cash), the game might as well have a price to it and even then i don't think they would allwo you to unlock all items that would have been locked through a pay wall. It is fun, but it quickly gets boring because of how large the restrictions are. At the very least allow us to use the in game money."
237350,Frozen Cortex,The computer cheats. It's ridiculoiusly hard to play. This game has potential but seems like it lacks depth in so many small areas that could really make this game the killer of Blood Bowl.
237370,PlayClaw 5,"OKay I tried my hardest to get along with this software but for the majority of the time it simply refuses to do anything at all. No screenshots, no recording .. sweet FA.  Very disappointed"
237430,Expeditions: Conquistador,"It is a pretty good game. Interesting turn-based combat, interesting camping mechanics and party-management, but some aspects (exploration) are rather repetative. Unit experience is also party-wide set amounts per battle, rather than individual. Overall, it is an enjoyable experience."
237470,Battle Worlds: Kronos,"Game is alot like massive assault and MA domination if you have ever played those before. Units and capabilities are almost identical just look less apealing :(. This is a decent replacment for them atleast in gameplay. Those being some what older games (10 years old+) make them not work well on vista win7 and later OS'es and they no longer have online play. So this game might fill the gap on those &amp; TBS players that enjoy a challenge. Personally I found it easier than MA and MA domination. Game is only recommended to those with a tactical and/or stratagist mind set, this isn't c&amp;c. So don't expect it. Take your time plan your approach to any givin situation. If you are getting r*aped by the A.I. you arn't playing the game right or approaching the enemy foolishly.  Graphicly not much better than a mobile port for 2013 looks less nice than c&amp;c TW so yea graphicly not getting much really. Voice overs in movies are terrible just cheesy and they sound like they are trying way to hard lol.  But in the end I'd say 7/10 pretty accurate meta. Pros have out weighed the cons for me I'm sure to get alot of TBS from the game and my $5 worth with ease."
237550,Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny,"I really wanted to like it, especially after all the patches... But, combat is still boring, voice acting is terrible and if you take a closer look, you'll notice that 3d models in battle mode have gigantic heads, even their limbs seem strangely shaped. Sorry, but this game feels cheap and rushed. Don't buy it, maybe Star Trail is going to be a better installment --and at least more faithful to the original."
237570,Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 4,"Smart design remixes and reimagines many elements of the classic JRPG formula to make for a game that's simultaneously familiar and new. Battles are more like puzzles that force you to rethink your team composition and ability usage and are balanced for the perfect level of difficulty. Don't sign up for the story, though--while Jerry is a great writer many formats, the narrative here is barely coherent."
237590,R.I.P.D.: The Game,*
237630,DuckTales Remastered,"This game is a lot of fun, the hole time I was playing I felt like I was a little kid again. Alan Young was the best with his voice acting and it was awesome and him being over 90 years old, it was fantastic. Not that many people get to reprise there rolls at that age.  I will say the worst part about this game is starting a new game undos all of what you unlocked. I wish I could change the difficulty without undoing all of your work. Still this game looks good and sounds grand, plays really good better then the Nintendo Entertainment System version.   Even knowing Alan Young is not with us any more I would love Ducktales 2 to be remasterd as well, maybe they could use the new cast for the 2017 show."
237740,Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures,Quite challenging and the constant swearing and suggestive themes get a bit old. Pretty fun though and I enjoyed it.
237760,Intake,"Solid Game from the folks at Cipher Prime. It's really nice to see them step out of the laid back music/puzzle genre and put them shiny sparkles into somethign more twitchy and visceral. Overall a great game that keeps ya coming back for more. Addicting, some might say."
237850,Dreamfall Chapters,"Loved it! Great story, great art direction and still true to the previous games."
237870,Planet Explorers,one of my favorite games can't wait until it is fully complete

237930,Transistor,"Fun gameplay, amazing music and outstanding visuals I highly recommend it."
237950,UFO: Afterlight,"I am big fan of squad based games and this one was the first series I played after the initial success of the original X-Com. This and the other UFO series games were a welcome addition to squad based games. Although not as atmospherically good as X-Com, it was still a fun game and had great improvements in graphics, research, and voice over. I did two play throughs when it was released pre-steam and picked it up on steam as the original disks would not work on a modern windows based system and have put in time now as well.  This game has had some issues with modern systems, even when working through steam. Occasional crashes and issues with some loading can be common so save often. I never had any issues that 10 or 15 of internet help or troubleshooting couldn't resolve to an acceptable level. I expect any game that was made before windows 7 to have issues on a modern system.   If your a fan of squad based games and you can stomach the idea of playing an older game far from the graphic and audio masterpieces that use all the current technologies and software available today pick it up. -- Well worth the $1.39, its priced for the autumn sale right now."
237970,Memento Mori 2,"Caveat Review! Recommended only for those with patience and a like for the first game. Poor translations and varying speeds in the playback of the voice acting are at once charming and off-putting. Subtitles and dialogue are often hilariously mismatched. Broken menus and a faulty save system paired with random crashes make this frustrating. The game autosaves when changing to new locations (not every screen as some have suggested.)   The 'detective points' system is back, but good luck applying any logic to some of the choices or figuring out what NOT to do in some cases. (e.g. Better take a picture of that handprint on the post (with the correct light) before 'looking' at it, or be docked several points later without even knowing why, because an automatic cutscene has been initiated for clicking on it...)  If you can tolerate any of the annoyances, you will find a deep mystery story and a detective mechanic that is fun and rewarding. Graphics are great and much care and attention went into the many locations."
237990,The Banner Saga,"Not sure why this game got so much love. It's Oregon Trail, with grid-based combat. That's not a bad thing, but it's not amazing either.   Takes just over 7 hours for a playthrough. I have no idea how anyone takes 12+ hours as some other reviews put it. It's not like this is some open world game where you can make choices to extend the gameplay. I can only assume people went afk during fights? /shrug  And, that 7 hours is padded by lots of stretches of time watching your caravan enter a town or waypoint, ever so glacially, while you twiddle your fingers.   There are, presumably, randomly generated events that occur while you're traveling the countryside, but they pop very rarely, so it's mostly just you watching your caravan glacially walk between point A and point B. Definitely should have drastically increased the encounter rate.   As for the reviews that claim there are deep effects from your choices in those events? Hogswash. Utter baloney.  And, balancing your supplies, rest, etc? No, not really. Morale is completely unimportant. Had the worst morale for pretty much the entire game. No food at all for about 1/3 of the game. Was completely unimportant.   Combat isn't terribly strategic, and the last 'boss' battle is extreamly easy if you just focus on the boss and ignore the minions. That said, you can up the difficulty. But, as there's not a ton of strategy to be had, upping the difficulty doesn't really do much for the game.   As for the story. This won a BAFTA. I have no idea how. There's a hint of an epic story in the background, but what you're actually given in the game amounts to very little, with a big jump in the story in the midpoint, making you wonder what the point even was of 1/2 of the 2 sides of the story.   In conclusion, the game would have been drastically improved if it didn't have so much 'dead' time while playing, just watching your caravan walk across the screen. More events. Drastically shorten the pointless 1-3 minutes of just watching your caravan enter a town, etc. A playthrough is 7 hours, but you're only going to spend half that actually playing, rather than just watching your screen, twiddling your thumbs. Not sure what could be done to combat without just starting over, but it's incredibly basic. Perhaps more mobility to spice things up for the enemy?   Oh, and it'd be remiss not to mention the game is only $4.99 on iOS and Android, both of which can be streamed to a TV. $20 on consoles and PC seems a stretch, especially since this is a 3 episode game, and most definitely not a AAA game ($60 for complete game would be AAA pricing)."
238010,Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut,It's a good game 👍
238050,The Apogee Throwback Pack,"it was interesting to play these. i never played these when i was younger. i played doom, quake, duke nukem etc. so its always nice to see some classics. i know some won't like it and honestly people can tell what they're getting from pictures and all. i mean really just look lol."
238070,Shadow Warrior Classic (1997),cool game nice nostalgia. its free and very small (292 mb or something) why not.
238090,Sniper Elite 3,"Another sad amateur-ish attempt in this franchise. I so wanted to like this game and I did find some hours of fun in it, but the truth in the end, it's much more frustrating than a game like this ought to be. Riddled with countless game breaking bugs and glitches, it's a pity that sniping enthusiasts can only pick between this game and Sniper Ghost. At least we have Sniper Elite V2; which when discussing pure sniping gameplay, was a much better game.  Pros: -Good looking game -Many modes besides the campaign and tons of coop gameplay -Levelling up system, unlocking weapons, items, and upgrades   Cons: -Story; though I doubt anybody's coming here for the writing, cutscenes, or voice acting -Music; seriously, can you hire a composer to get rid of this tired theme that you've been recycling since the first one?! -As for the biggest problem of all: GAMEPLAY. Here's a breakdown of the biggest issues:  *SE3 is not a sniping game anymore. It's a bad amateur attempt at Spliter Cell lite with a sniper rifle tagged on. The game has suddenly become about the Welrod and taking out enemies silently. Even the main character is often heard at the start of levels muttering in that dark generic voice: 'I need to stay quiet on this one!' Sadly, the animations and controls do not back up this kind of gameplay. Whatever happened to the cover mechanic in V2??  *Sniping from cover is broken. Since there's no cover system anymore, you kinda have to hug walls and corners but you're never really sure if you're currently in cover or if your shoulder's poking out the corner. Then when you aim thru the scope and attempt a few shots, you'll notice that nothing's connecting even though you can see your target clearly thru your scope. That's because your rifle has actually gone through the geometry of whatever cover your behind and your bullets are not firing through. A proper developer with a proper design would've thought 'oh? the player can see the target unobstructed? Then his bullet should connect because that's a valid game response.' You can't really control your rifle beyond general direction so whether the rifle is stuck in geometry or under it shouldn't really be the player's fault or responsibility.   *Another fun one is that grenades don't necessarily have to follow the guide arc that is drawn for you...which renders them useless or rather...suicidal when throwing them from cover. I can't count the number of times I've killed myself in deathmatches when trying to lob a grenade up an elevated position only to have it bounce right back at me. And that's after careful aiming and making sure the arc dipped onto the elevation.  *I've given up on hoping for a decent AI system in the SE franchise. Again, the enemy is either plain dumb or just clairvoyant. And there's no reasonable challege at higher difficulties. Just overpowered AI that can somehow hit you with an MP40 over 150m away. They also become bullet-sponges requiring as many as 3 hits from your rifle before they die. Authentic difficulty shouldn't mean 3x health points + superhuman aiming using an MG. It should rather mean 'there's a sniper out there and I'm not leaving my cover to spray and pray with my MP40 because I know that's futile against a scoped rifle!' Developers ought to learn how to create proper AI by just playing some deathmatches! When you hear a shot and a bullet whizzing by you, do you run in the general direction of the source hoping to find the sniper? Or do you duck behind cover and observe and attempt to flank?!  *The relocating mechanic was an interesting addition and it sorta works but it needs to be coupled with an AI that is aware of its own mortality. Again, you can't just go investigate a spot where a shot came from. A solo soldier on patrol ought to freeze in his shoes then flee like hell when he discovers he's being targetted or shot at. A group of soldiers ought to take cover and attempt to flank around moving from cover to cover. That's what makes multiplayer matches far more interesting and 'authentic'. Also, why is it that enemy AI knows your general position and forces you to relocate when you lob a grenade? The impact area has nothing to do with the grenadier's last position. Instead of running over to check up on the blown soldiers (who are obviously way dead by now), the AI ought to stay clear off that area. Whatever lobbed that grenade over there could certainly lob a second one!! All these issues make soldiers just unnecessary meatbags between you and your objective. And the only thing that changes about them is their aiming accuracy and amount of bullets they can absorb.  *Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission has to end with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'boss battle' against a tank. And every tank (or vehicle) has a silly weak point that you need to hit twice before it goes down. Yes, we get it! We've been doing that since SE1!! What is the point of those tanks anyways if they can be taken out so easily?! Did the Germans deploy tanks when dealing with snipers in WW2?! Why not create something 'authentic' a la Enemy at the Gates and make an amazingly scripted 1 on 1 sniper hunt? An enemy sniper who has the same tools and weapons as you and is patiently tracking you down as you track him. Naah! Let's just throw one more Panzer in there that can magically pick your sillhouette out in that one window of many windows out of the many different buildings and vantage points that are currently surrounding it. The mathematical line of sight check returned true after all and there's no gameplay tweaking that needs to be done here!! ;)   So get it if on sale, avoid campaign mode, stick to multiplayer and coop, and try to cope with the bugs. There's still some fun to be had against human opponents!"
238210,System Shock 2,"Still relevant, even after all these years. A must-play game for any sci-fi fan. Also, better than Half-Life."
238240,Edge of Space,"Much potential, but the devs killed it. Now it is a floating debree on the Edge of Steam"
238260,Pinball Arcade,Not free to play.
238280,Legend of Dungeon,"This game is cool, I just wished they added there old stretch goals.... :("
238320,Outlast,"My favorite horror game. I recommend it everyone who doesn't have weak heart. In this game you will need to escape from mentaly insane patients, slow some puzzles and see a bunch of human blood and organs....."
238370,Magicka 2,"this game is nice, they fixed some stuff from the first one, but it's too damn short... campaign took only 4 hours (waiting because of some minor bugs with multiplayer included). p.s. i doesn't feel like you wanna play it again cause it's a bit repeatable even in the first run"
238430,Contagion,This game is fun with friends and even better with friends
238460,BattleBlock Theater,"The game is fun and all but the multiplayer function does not work for me. (READ TILL THE END) I tried checking out Youtube videos to fix this, but nothing helped. Without the multiplayer function, the game became boring to me, so I decied to ask for a refund. There was even an option to select that you can not play multiplayer (when I tried to get a refund). After a good bunch of months, I'm still waiting for a refund. Download this game, if you do not expect to get a refund."
238530,Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe,"it's aight  +good art style +good controls +good character selection  -not much content, is more arcade style tbh -the lava level is pretty cheap bc of the lava bubbles coming from the bottom but if you let the block height grow a bit you should be fine on reaction time"
238750,Might & Magic X - Legacy ,"Put a lot of hours into this. Solid tactical combat. No story. Voice acting is terrible. Did I mention satisfying, tactical, and diverse combat? It's a great game."
238870,Citadels,This game is bad. Just don't buy it because it has major glitches that I have incountered and much more.
238890,Skyward Collapse,The idea is good in theory and I want to like the game; but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired and it gets quite tedious as the cities expans. I wouldn't recommend.
238910,Bionic Dues,THATS MY GAME :)
238930,"7 Grand Steps, Step 1: What Ancients Begat","I definitely enjoyed the time that I spent with this game. Going through the ages was very fun, and I wanted the next game immediately after."
238960,Path of Exile,"Gotta say, I love the depth that this game has to offer. In addition, Path of Exile offers a dynamic market system involving character interaction. I will note that to the new player it's a bit overwhelming and will require some amount of research before you understand how it all works, but the pay off of the game clicking together is worth it. That great moment when you plan a build, level up and progress toward the endgame and can start making currency to perfect your stats is the dream for players who seek min/max style games.  Overall, I reccommend this Action RPG to both casual players and the more hardcore. Being that it's free, the casual player has no reason not to give it a shot. As for the more hardcore, this is the Action RPG for you and your late hours spent min/maxing gear, trading with others, and clearing content to get phat loots.  Download it, Try it out. I could only stop long enough to write this review, back to the game.  PS: All money spent in the game goes toward storage space and cosmetic items, no need to fear the dreaded F2P 'pay to win' aspect in this game!"
2390,Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders,This game was as cool as I remembered. I never thought to be playing this game again.
239030,"Papers, Please","The true epitome of desk space management. In all seriousness it's a great game that heightens your attention to detail, and increases your personal finance skills if you want that class 5 appartment. Anyone can pick up this game, play it for one day and get sucked into it"
239070,Hammerwatch,"Apparently I need a better graphics card. My 1986 PC couldn't handle this, because I wanted to go full screen at 1920x1080 and the mouse controls just lagged and showed in a different position than the mouse actually was.  10/10 would configure game again and waste 30 minutes."
239090,Samurai Gunn,"one of the best party games out there, had many a laugh with friends playing this."
239120,Final Fantasy III (3D Remake),The updated graphics on this make it look like it would be on par with FF 4 but it is not anywhere near as good in any single way. This game's story is incredibly boring and it is a direct port of the mobile version which I also own. I purchased this to add to my Final Fantasy collection but it is by far the worst one out of them all and I can't see myself bothering trying to play it any further.
239140,Dying Light,"Linux Users.... dont buy Game its only single player or you have to wait for people to join your game, so if you spend all this money get the story line completed and want to join others gaming progress to help them ... YOU CANT ! and there hasnt been solved up to this date .... disaponting a co-op game that doens let you join others.... also you cant play the zombie since its based on intruding others (you cant) but you can try the foking toturial :(    Amazing game, great performance, beautifull colours and views, great single player...."
239160,Thief,"In Thief you tragically lose your friend due to a mysterious ritual you two witness. You walk around in a open world and do thief jobs which can be tedious if you don't want to be detected and don't have any special powers.  If you want 100% achievements in this game you will probably need a guide. I could have finished the entire game in 1/3rd of the total time I spend on it but I finished it with out hurting anyone, undetected and with out using my skill that highlights objects.  Playing this game stopped being fun after a while because I am not a fan of stealth games."
239200,Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs,"As a huge Amnesia fan I was really dissapointed in this game, nothing happens, the monsters aren't scary, you see the monsters all of 5 times maybe and the music didn't make me ♥♥♥♥ my pants. I get that they were trying to make this Amnesia game more story focused I guess, but the story isn't even good. Huge let down after having expections to match up with The Dark Decent or better."
239250,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2,"If Capcom &amp; Santa Monica had a son.. this would be him!   At first i thought that it won't be like the first one because it is in modern age but this is the perfect Dracula Game! It has a lot better: Animations, Graphics,  More Cutscenes which make it more cinematic  and reminds me a lot of Dracula Untold! The only thing i hated was the ending.. it was like watching Konami giving up on making games :D"
239350,Spelunky,"Roguelike games can be hit and miss, and this one was more of a miss for me. The game is quite difficult with only 4 hitpoints and the procedural generation can be quite unfair at times with blind jumps down pits being the only way to move forwards. No matter how well you did or how far you got, when you die, you're back at the beginning. There's no way to save a game in progress either so you have to complete the entire game in one sitting.  For me, this game would have been much more enjoyable as an action platformer with proper level design like in the tutorial and save points rather than a difficult roguelike that is always killing me and forcing me to restart the game.  In short, I did not really enjoy this game due to the combination of poor level generation and the high difficulty level."
239430,Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut,"-Portalesque feel but not quite up to the same standards (but what puzzler really is...?) -Corny story. -A bit short main story (~2.5 h for me), however there are some extra content (time trial levels) that I have yet to explore... -Puzzles were perhaps a bit too easy (this is a fine balance though, since it is frustrating to get stuck too...)  Perhaps not a masterpiece but still an OK puzzler to keep you entertained for a few hours. Get it when on sale! (But if you haven't yet played Portal/Portal 2, get those instead...)"
239450,Gun Monkeys,great game to have fun on! :)
239700,Hate Plus,L4RM please
239800,Bleed,"Whoever made the jump controls for this game needs a special layer of Hell where all they do for eternity is jump through a ♥♥♥♥ing hoop with bilateral tib-fib fractures.  Seriously, how do you ♥♥♥♥ up jump mechanics in a 2D-side scroller?"
239820,Game Dev Tycoon,"At the start I had a lot of fun and I thought I would most definitely have an addiction but then I got farther into the game and I really didn't like it at that point I didn't have any good topics and the choices I had for researching them were terrible and I lost all of my progress on one save and I don't know how, but I had a Company area with 4.2M dollars.  Not a good choice for a game, but luckily I have only played 93 minutes so I can get a refund on the game."
239840,Dead State,"Promising, but way too many bugs and overall an incomplete game. For that steep price I would recommened not to buy it, maybe for a couple of bucks it's OKAY. Feeling kind of ripped off and this just highlights the game in a whole.  I would recommened 'Survivalist' instead, cheap and much more enjoyable with great devs.  DO NOT SUPPORT DEVS WHO SELL THEIR GAME AS A FINISHED PRODUCT EVENTHOUGH IT'S FAR FROM IT."
240,Counter-Strike: Source,"Much better than its successor, but features some heavy balancing issues."
2400,The Ship,Damn I love backstabbing people :3 :3
24010,Train Simulator,"Game content is very lacking for a simulation game: 1. The game only gets you three Quick Drive routes and 'career' (scored) runs on those routes. Don't be surprised when you open 'Free Roam' tab and find no content there - the game never had those content to begin with. 2. Insufficient tutorials and documentations, especially on the topic of reading rail traffic signals. Consider it ordinary to run 50 minutes into a 'career' route and suddenly -10000 points from a speed limit that was never briefed to you."
240320,Panzar,"So, after couple years it became hard-try-ghost-town of tutorials. Like an hour of them, that's not what I hoped for unfortunately. After that, there were no servers at all. Dont bother and have a good day!"
240340,Space Ace,Short but fun
240360,Dragon's Lair 2: Time Warp,"BRO 420 blaze it, then play this game huehue"
240440,Quadrilateral Cowboy,"It is a very entertaining puzzle game. While it is not a strict 'terminal game' you do use a command line to enter text commands throughout the game. I really wish I could recommend it, but with the non-stop issues I've been having, I can't, in good faith, do it.   My only complaints are with the bugs I have run into while playing it. After running it for a couple of hours, the game will spontaneously lock up. Sometimes when I load the game it will load into a 640x480 window and freeze. And sometimes when I play, I am not able to cycle back through the keyboard commands without it also adding a carriage return. (IE, if my last command was 'test' I should be able to hit the up arrow to get the 'test' command line to appear in my current field--however, while it does bring up the 'test' command it effectively hits &lt;ENTER&gt; executing the command by itself). Most of the time I can just cycle through all of my previous commands with no issues, but once this started happening, I have not been able to stop it from happening. I have posted these issues in the support forum, but have not received a single response.   I'm sure it will all be patched and working in a few months and by then I can revisit it and (hopefully) change my recommendation."
240600,MotoGP™13,I'm using a laptop so I can't really play a lot of games. And I didn't know anything about refunding games when I bought this game.  I wanted to play the game even tho it was lagging (and I put my video settings on the lowest but it didn't work). I didn't have a controller so it was hard to control the vehicle.  then the next month my friend told me on how to refund games then I got mat because I can't refund it.
240620,Wanderlust Adventures,"Played this once with some friends and haven't been able to get back into it since... To me it is a repetative and boring game with little challange or reward. It might be up someone's alley, but certainly isn't for me."
240660,RainBlood Chronicles: Mirage,"I liked the game and hated it at the same time, mostly due to missed potential.  Gameplay: The playstyles of the two characters are complementary and the active switch between them makes things interesting. The combos are good, and if you find your rhythm you're in for a treat. Unfortunately, this becomes hard to lack of collisions with the enemies and the inability to turn unless you completely stop attacking. For me this made the game un-enjoyable.  VIsuals: Great aesthetics and artistic direction here, the entire storyboard could be printed and sold as a comic book or be turned into posters. The characters / background / enemies are distinct and the visual effects sit on top of them without the screen feeling clustered, just action-packed :)  Audio: Absolutely great. From emotional to inspiring to combat music they hit it spot on.  Story: I only reached about one fourth of the game, but so far it's been a kid's story for better or for worse - the plot is nothing interesting and you've heard the same story a thousand times just with different heroes / objective. The characters have some personality which makes things better though. And of course, the whole experience becomes like a B-Movie due to the mediocre translation.  Unless you're willing to work past some gameplay inconveniences and bad translation I wouldn't recommend this game. And that's sad because it's missing two things which could have very easily been prevented."
240760,Wasteland 2,"I love it. Reminds me of Fallout Tactics, but I hit more often. If only it would stop CRASHING ON ME EVERY 10 MINUTES!! And 10 minutes of play is lucky. It crashed on me while I was making my Rangers in a New Game. But, I love it. So I suffer with the crashing. Might just be my computer though."
240970,Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming,THIS GAME.    THIS GAME.    You want it.  And once you beat it.    You will beat it again.    9001/10 will Run in the Fast Lane again.
241240,Contraption Maker,"  This game is good for anyone who likes making puzzels and contraptions. My only complaint is that it lacks multiplayer. It says it does, but you can only build a contraption together and not complete them with each other."
241260,Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,"Yeah, not bad, not bad. Get it on sale. Because it's worth it. Watson in the game looks like a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and hardly like someone who is a doctor. Not helpful at all. Just standing there voicing some generic comments from time to time, or asking you, what shall we do, what shall we do... Stupid.   Other than that it's not bad, it gets interesting with the story, but could've done a much better job.     "
241320,Ittle Dew,"As a fan of Zelda, I love this game so much. Adorable animations and cute gameplay."
241540,State of Decay,Never buy 'early access'. You dont get the game just a buggy 'beta'.
241560,The Crew,Game is ok..but der is room for improvement...bought the seasons pass thinking all the dlc will be included but to my surprise the callin all units needs to be bought separately.
241600,Rogue Legacy,"If you're looking for a game with crisp controls and decent combat, look away."
241620,Inquisitor,I really am enjoying the story of the game but at alot of points in the game it is basically a really boing walking simulator so I do not recommend this game.   Accidently Reviewed
241660,Ohm Studio,Great place to make music with people around the world. Easy to use.
241680,Actual Multiple Monitors,"This is a castrated version of Actual Windows Manager - a nice combine of tools made to turn your daily routine easier if you have more than one monitor. It's main features for me are tray mirroring and mouse locking. Unfortunately, the tool is still in production, many is to be changed, and there are some errors/crashes if you treat that tool without care.  Actual multiple monitors has main features you can live without or replicate with freeware. But they're combined in one big app. There are really few things that could be dome better. UI is a mess, it's really hard to find what you're looking for. Some options are not obvious. The nice thing about it, is that you have a nice way of testing it for free for 30 days at their official website *BEFORE BYING*. Try it, and then try other tools, and keep in mind that sometimes freeware programms that are meant to provide single functions like 'always on top' and 'lock mouse on monitor' are better than all in one. But if you want to get all at once - grab this one, or go for 'window manager' app, but I repeat, THIS might cause your system to run slower.  BUT the worst thing about this software - it makes your computer games LAG LIKE HELL when you move your mouse."
241720,Guncraft,"Its a real shame how this game died out, and it seems like any other military shooter that anyone can pick up and play.  The interface menus could use more work, but everything else is fine, even the gunsmithing mode is a great idea and its leads better than Blockstorm. the only weapon I made for the game was a double barreled shotgun that was dangerous at close and few steps ahead of it's range but a long reload time. but that was years ago.  Haven't seen a person play this game in a while, so can't recommend."
241760,Kill to Collect,"Honestly the first few hours of the game are good. Solid gameplay, the music is amazing, the controls are great. It's fun until you actually put time into it...Then you realize the game is made with little care or effort. The game has glitches that have not been fixed (I see forum posts about the same issues from 3 months back which the devs saw and did nothing about).  It also gets incredibly difficult towards the end, with boss combinations similar to early Diablo 3 (shield, clone, teleport) that make it nearly impossible to beat unless you have a full group of friends. I feel like with a responsive dev team this game could be great, but it doesn't seem like they want to put the effort into it.  TLDR; The game almost requires a group. With a small community, this is difficult. Buy it if you have some friends willing to play with you. The game has minor glitches. Lacks dev communication."
241790,Z3TA+ 2,No Mac compatability. Decent synth but dont buy it on steam.
241910,Goodbye Deponia,These games are crazy fun. The story will surprise you and the characters will grow on you. Be prepared for a wild ride.
241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"i haven't played any campaign yet as i was captured by exploring the world. It already seems like a nice game, with very cool combat system, super-cool graphics and other cool gameplay features, including some collectible pieces of lore, and lots of side quests and such. Very cool game."
241990,Sorcerer King,"This game is very disappointing. I have played other Stardock games and enjoyed them. This one just doesn't stand up. Not only are there little easy fixes that would make the game more enjoyable, there are major problems in my opinion with the AI. A simple fix would be with crafting. I am able to make three of the same item but I can't make them all at once. Put an incremental button and let me make them more than one at a time! The auto battle at times just does inexplicable things. I have had 4 units against one half dead one and lose the fight. I just quit a game where after having a good game going, I had a Fire Demon Army with 105 rating attack my city. Even if all I did was make defenders from the beginning of the game I woujld have still lot. I am removing this game from my computer and finding something new to play."
2420,The Ship Single Player,"So here's something that wasn't mentioned in the game description, apparently this is not a standalone (I assumed it was after reading all the info on it, and unless I was mistaken there was nothing mentioned about it being a mod.) While the game itself might be a wonderously witty and well done game, I'm hesitant to put more money (especially since I can only buy the 20$ bundle that includes the game I already have), into this game, my only solace is that it was on sale for 2$."
24200,DC Universe Online,"Player from the time this game went Free 2 Play to today with next to no break in between. I run this game mostly on an extern installation so the steam time is only half of it worth what I spend my time on this game (yes I'm a nerd).  The game has its moments. If you start playing now expect to hit endgame fairly easy. High geared players carry you through the game cause they might be after feats/styles itself in there. Is there anything hard in this game? For the average player you will find one or two hard things but there is barely anything considered to be difficult as the development dumped down content pretty heavy to accomodate casuals and replay badges sales and difficulty is being determined more by luck / powerset combinations than actual player skill ( I have gotten the most Firsts in the game and were part of the only group who ever managed to beat a cr-scaled Survival Mode, I know what I'm talking about ;-) ).  If you like to play casual the game is for you, if you strive for real hardcore content with difficulty that is in the hand of the player to overcome you will be wrong here and better move on before being dissappointed. I strive through other games to find such piece. Sadly WildStar died but had the best raids in the genre (multiple firsts there too).  Update December 2016: With the introduction of a new gearing progression that is tedious and super boring after some time I could barely recommend this game anymore. What makes me to change my upvote into a downvote is the cheer greed they put up with Time Capsules that started fairly human and achievable to a heavy greed on the 2nd iteration with very low droprates on specific items and the upcoming anniversary event wont be any better. The better part of StatsMatter and removal of CR Scaling is long time ahead and until then I keep the vote as is.  Some White Knights would say 'Don't you want the game to keep running?' and I will be like 'How did it run the last 6 years without all those stuff?'. Your strawman arguments don't work towards reasonable humans.  Gameplay from my PoV can be found on  youtube.com/elusian "
242050,Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag,Thumbs down for having to log into uplay to play it and muck around.

242130,Vector Thrust,"In short, don't bother...yes, every plane feels very unique and interesting, but nothing is this game is explained, and many of the features of the game are as clear as mud, much like the interface...

24240,PAYDAY: The Heist, I made the mistake of saving 2 dollars and buying this instead of Payday 2.
242530,The Chaos Engine,"Buy a Sega Megadrive, two controllers and a copy of Chaos Engine, or if you're American: Buy a Sega Genesis, two controllers and a copy of Soldiers of Fortune.  Either way, play this game but avoid this port, this is coming from A FAN of the Chaos Engine game."
242550,Rayman Legends,"Amazing Gameplay, gorgeous af, local co op, and a boat load of levels to keep you occupied and coming back. This is an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone. The only gripes I have with it is you need to install Uplay to play it and have a farly good PC to run it smoothly. If you can get around those, I would definitely recommend you pick it up."
242570,Space Hulk,"Man this game is tough. Seriously. on Normal level, if the enemy was right in front of you, you can miss hitting him four times in a row with even 56% of hitting him. WTF. Isnt there any way of level up the guns?? They JAM TOO MUCH. Forget about melee combat. SHEESH."
242640,Styx: Master of Shadows,"Bought on 2016 Christmas sales. Have to say didn't regret it. It might have some flaws but its very decent to say the least.  At 30euros, I don't recommend it. On a sale, its a must have for stealth gamers. "

242760,The Forest, Early Access Review
242780,Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller,"Arrrghhhhh!  The story is fine. The voice acting is fine. The art assets are fine. But the UX just murders this game. Everything is just gllaacciiaalllllllll. Erica moves (when she responds to your inputs at all) at a snail's pace. A tutorial popup suggesting double-clicking to get her to run, but no dice. She just crawlllllls. And after you select an action, get ready for her to think about it, shuffle to the left two steps, then slowly walk towards the target, all while stressing 'we have to go fast to save my brother.'  Skip this ludonarratively dissonant trash fire and play a good adventure game."
242820,140,"I cannot recommend this to anyone. It's harder than Super Hexagon. I wasted every 3 seconds to jump and died. Mirrored mode even worse, I've no talent for a 'perfect jump', nor as a perfection.  Only if you accept insane challenges, you can continue to hunt for 100% achievements. I can't say this game is bad, but it's near to zero replayability.  "
242840,In Verbis Virtus,"This game should explain its premis better, such as explaining why the protagonist was stumbling in the desert. The combat in this game seems it be pointless and frustrating, The 'Beam Of Light' spell is not efficient enough to fight the 'glowing bugs' and the narrow passages don't allow for any tactics to avoid them. I suggest that the 'Glowing Bugs' should be repealed by the 'Let There Be Light' spell. The visuals and spell mechanics are intriguing and the game as a whole needs improving."
242860,Verdun,"I used to have lots of fun with Verdun. It was a great game that I could play for hours. Now it has become poorly optimized with many bugs, and it's just not enjoyable anymore. Lets hope there are some updates to fix this soon."
242880,"Sir, You Are Being Hunted","I think this game is too rough to really be considered a final product; to me, it seems more like it belongs in the late stages of early-access. Honestly, I don't think this is trash or anything, but I can't recommend it, especially at full price.  I think this is an OK game, but it definitely isn't worth $20. Additionally, it still feels very rough but the last update was in Oct 2015 (it's now Apr 2016) and the version is 1.0+, so I don't know if the dev is planning to do much more with it. If you're playing this single player, I can't imagine you getting more than 3 hours of quality gaming out of it (I probably got around 1.5 hours myself before I got bored of it). The multiplayer is a bit clunky to set up and once you've got a game going, I guess it could be good if you have like 4 or 5 people in it, but when you have 2 or 3 I personally didn't find it added much.  Overall, it's a decent game that needs polish, but I don't think it'll ever get it. $20 for this is just absurd though, even with all the necessary polish I'd say $15 is the max I could ever recommend this for. In its current state, if you're ok with a rough game that will probably remain so, I'd recommend picking it up at around $7, maybe $10 if you have 4 or 5 friends who are also going to get it."
242920,Banished,"I love this game, but theres things that make no sence and that dont even work, people have died on me from starvation even though we have food, they wont build even though we have the materials and many more things that make this game stupid, i wouldnt recommend this game until all these things have been fixed and the game is much more injoyable,  "

243000,Omikron - The Nomad Soul,"Such a weird game... I love it! Granted it hasn't aged that well, but with a David Bowie soundtrack and a weird meta 4th wall story line, I can totally recommend it. :)"
243040,Startopia,cool game bro
243060,Urban Chaos,"PLUS:   Game mechanics are fine. You need arrow keys, y, x and c, some of the numbers and space and you´re good to go. Those who complain are like someone sucking at basketball and blaming the court, the shoes, the ball, the net, other players - but not oneself.   Driving is a lot of fun.  Dialogues are funny.   The graphics might be outdated but it has a certain feel to it that makes it superior to more 'realistic' games.     MINUS:    Nothing."
243160,Mushroom 11,"Great puzzle game, unique concept. 5 hours of solid gameplay. Huge minus: cople of last are to dificulty (execution wise)"

243220,FRACT OSC,"Buggy and glitchy. Freezes on loads, hangs up on startups, crashes on exits. I tried to play on a MacBook Pro early 2013 if someone is interested. Can't play due to crashes, but the game is really cool and unusual."
243280,Poof,  This game is amazing :D  A real time waster too. I couldn't stop playing it...  GIVE THIS GAME 'JUST 5 MORE MINUTES' AWARD !!!

243450,Urban Trial Freestyle,"This game is 10% luck 20% skill  15% concentrated power of the will 5% pleasure 50% frustration 100% cancer for getting all those Achievement  and 200% reason not to buy at the full price  Verdict -Story 1/10 a freedom biker who pursued by a police  -Graphic 8/10 not much settings but beautiful -Gameplay hard and annoying at first with default bike surely it's dev intention -Music/Sound 4/10 not much bgm, sfx are okay but bike sounds are repetitive and out of place when hold the button -Replayability 50:50 'Yes' if you want achievement / challenge with friends   Tbh, This Trial Series are nothing compare to Downhill Domination PS2 game"
243470,Watch_Dogs,"A beautiful world, great storytelling, and good 'hacking' mechanic are offset by extremely generic combat, boring (and even more generic) side missions, pointless collectibles, and some porting issues.   'Watch Dogs' saving grace is Ubisoft's excellent voice acting, rigging, and storytelling (despite a typical Hollywood-esque plot), but the core gameplay is bland and the minigames only make the situation worse. There are far too many better games in the genre to play first.   GTA 5, Saints Row 3, and Sleeping Dogs all 'do the same thing' but much better.    PROS: -Beautiful diverse city that truly feels like a city. Textures are re-using minimally and, in general, every part of the city looks different and unique. They really did this well. -'Hacking' mechanic opens a number of enviornmental game mechanics (like being able to move devices, open doors, etc) which lead to a variety of puzzles and alternate means to complete combat areas. -Progression is well laid out, rewarding abilities both for XP gain and for completing side objectives.  -Adult themes (though the plot itself is a bit silly at times, the individual scenes are well done) -Great storytelling (but fairly typical Hollywood plot) -Great voice acting (Ubisoft seems to shine here) -Great rigging. You can really tell characters emotions through their expressions. (again Ubisoft shines here)  NEUTRALS: -Generic plot (but great storytelling) -Car handling is all over the place. Some cars drive great, others oversteer like crazy for no apparent reason.   CONS: -'Radio' sucks. When you get in a car, a song just starts playing from the beginning. There is no 'radio banter'.  -Music selection is small and very weak (compare to the awesome tracks in GTA or Sleeping Dogs) -'Focus' (bullet time) is a completely worthless mechanic and is not integrated into gameplay in any way (I did not use it a single time at all).  -'one button' melee combat; gun combat is very simplistic and generic; side content is basically mini-flash games (compare to the 'taxi' game of GTA, etc). -Annoying cover system. Expect to die many times because your character is 'stuck' to the cover and you can't walk away without pushing a 'leave cover' key. This might be the kind of garbage that is needed for console players using controllers but on a M+K setup this will do nothing but get you killed over and over. I *literally* died more times due to this than any other death in the game... -Poor shooting. Mouse Acceleration seems to be forced to 'on' with no options to turn it off.. The guns have insane recoil but 1 headshot kills so I found using the pistol was far more effective than the smg... and the sniper rifle zooms in way too far (not adjustable).  -POOR Console port! Weapon selection doens't make sense and contradicts in-game text. See below for an in-depth explanation of this idiocy. -Cannot rebind weapon setup (also explained below). -Major lack of parked cars on certain parts of the road. (If you aren't positioned where the devs expect you to be when certain 'chase' missions start, you will not find a car in time no matter what you do and you must restart the mission so the game sets your position next to a specially positioned car placed for that mission) -Money obtained from ATM Hacking random people on the street is WAY too much. Most ingame events (assuming you complete them successfully) reward $200-1,000, but randomly running around and hacking people (esp if you get the auto-detect blue citizens upgrade early) you will get anywhere from $1,000-$15,000 per person instantly. Before finishing Act 1, I had over $500,000 in hand... -unable to skip cutscenes....its 2016... -uPlay   WEAPON SELECTION WORKS LIKE THIS: All weapons you find are always equipped on you (even tho ingame text says to use a gun shop).  You hold the 'weapon wheel' button and a wheel pops up with 4 choices (NOT adjustable)....top is always pistol, right is always smg, left is always shotgun, and bottom is BOTH grenade launcher and sniper rifle....  So, in order to change which pistol or which smg (or most importantly, to go from sniper to grenade launcher) you have to hold the weapon wheel button, then move your mouse downward to select the sniper rifle for example....and then you have tou push the RIGHT OR LEFT ARROW KEYS (so you must let go of the mouse). Doing this during combat on 'realistic' difficulty is EXTRA fun."
243780,PixelJunk™ Monsters Ultimate,"I Used to play this game when i was younger on the PS3, It is probably the most difficult Tower Defense I have ever played and still had loads of fun at the same time. If you love TD games then I really reccomend playing this game"

243890,Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Family Edition,"I was disappointed with Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. I was really hoping that I could share this to my childrens accounts. Bummer that I can't. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't buy this."
243930,Bound By Flame,"I'll admit it can have a rough start that may be too much for some to put up with. However, combat does get more reasonable once you're able to upgrade weapons, armor and skills. If you're looking for a great game with amazing story, character building, interesting world lore... This is not what you're looking for. It is a good game, but it's not for everybody. If you're starving for anything RPG like I am, this scratches the itch to a reasonable extent. If you're expecting Skyrim or Dark Souls, look elsewhere. Probably would've been more disappointed if I paid full price, but if you can get this for less than 10$, it's well worth it. Surprised it worked on my system, 32bit Vista with bad graphics card; performance is not an issue."
243950,Divinity: Dragon Commander,"This realm of imps, lizardmen, and walking skeletons coincidentally happens to grapple with all of the same political soundbyte issues of 21st human civilization! The devs really want you to know that, so you'll spend a fair amount of time learning that elves like to smoke the green stuff and dwarves detest universal healthcare. Fortunately it doesn't ruin the game's immersion... because it's really not that immersive to begin with. No small number of mistakes in ability descriptions and other in-game text, to boot.  Your generals will do a roll-of-the-dice job at resolving battles for you, so on the Risk-style map your options are to either amass a force that even in the most inept hands could still overpower the enemy and let an AI general take care of the battle for you, or invade with a laughably underpowered force but control the army yourself, RTS-style. If you can stay alive for the first 2 minutes of battle, you'll then be able to transform into a dragon and with even a modicum of FPS-skill obliterate the entire enemy force.  The RTS depth is kiddie pool. Spam unit construction and send them all in a big blob at the enemy base. If they aren't able to take care of it on their own, again, you're a dragon in the sky, raining down AOE death on the AI's clumsily clumped units. When they finally get respectable anti-air units around Chapter 2, you'll have to disengage occasionally and invest in the dragon skills that give better health and HP regen, but ultimately, it just doesn't feel like this game reaches satisfying enough heights to justify the sheer number of times you're going to have to go through the 'Build a factory', 'Spam units', 'Select all units and mass attack on enemy base', 'Support them from the skies' routine. That glimmer of fun from the first few battles quickly fades into monotony. Cut all that out in favor of the auto-resolve AI generals, and all you're left with is modified Risk interspersed with obnoxious inflamatory topics of debate in the throne room.  The Pros? Those first few flights as a dragon, singlehandedly nullifying the enemy's army investment. Quality voice acting. A fresh take on RTS controls--learning how to manage the hotkeys while also flying and fighting is a new experience. Princesses!"
24400,King Arthur - The Role-playing Wargame,"So I tried to play this game a lot (on holiday). It kept crashing, but I persevered since I was kidn of enjoying it. Until the crashes became more than the game, and I gave up. DO NOT BUY THIS BUGGY CRASHING POS. DO NOT BUY THE SEQUEL."

244050,Rise of Flight United,"It's damn far from perfect, but the way the planes modelled beautifully and the sensation of shooting an enemy down just makes it worth it."
244070,Sid Meier's Ace Patrol,"When I first started playing this game, I wasn't sure how well aerial combat would translate to a Turn-Based Strategy game. But, sure enough, this game is a worthy part of Sid Meier's brilliant line. I certainly enjoyed it and, while I didn't play any multiplayer, I imagine that it was enjoyable on all fronts, so here are some Pros and Cons.  PROS - Does require thought and memory so you can't just wing it, especially on higher difficulties (no pun intended). - Sid Meier's classic customization is present, allowing you to rename the pilots (I personally named them after characters from Avatar: Legend of Korra, RWBY, and Code Lyoko, because why not?). Also, pilots can gain upgrades and abilities as they become more experience, allowing specialization. - Graphics and sound are great for the game. - The mechanics of it all are fun to work out but not dreadfully challenging. - It is very satisfying when you one-hit kill an enemy ace on higher levels. Satisfaction for a successful run increases with difficulty level. - It has multiplayer. I'm counting that as a pro.  CONS - Like most games, the AI could use improvement, but this is just a minor complaint. For what it's supposed to do, the AI does well enough. - I'll admit that, save for Germany and maybe the UK, I didn't really notice the national bonuses. But I guess 2 out of 4 isn't that bad.  Other than that, I have no complaints. If you can, you should certainly give this game a try."

24420,Aquaria,"Doesn't save games no matter where I install it and no matter what folder permissions I set up.  There are a lot of people with various save issues on the official forums of the game, but it looks like the devs don't care to fix the game for Vista and the newer Win OS.  Support indie? Yep, sure!"
244210,Assetto Corsa,"Picked up the PC version after being thoroughly impressed w/ AC on PS4. Hands down the best driving physics &amp; force-feedback I've experienced in a game! If you like sim-racing buy AC, get a wheel, and enjoy the best Nürburgring track in video games."

244450,Men of War: Assault Squad 2,theres a bug where the nazi army develops technology to crash the game if you're playing for more than an hour.
244590,Epigenesis,"I find this game to be fun, however the lack of variety in maps can get a bit boring.  The AI is very derpy on easy mode, to the point where it just jumps off any platform it can find, and the harder difficulty AI isn't any smater either. I have noticed, however, that the AI tends to take a very linear path EVERY TIME and there is no variety in the movement whatsoever, so calling the opponent and AI seems a bit too generous.  The graphics are okay, but they aren't spectacular.   This game isn't the best compared to most other football-like games, but it's still worth a go if you like feeling superior against an AI that seems like it's been programmed by a 5 year old who thinks he's entitles but you're just like 'ha, no' and push him down because the TV remote is yours and he goes off crying to your mum with them fake tears and your mum patronises him and you're just there like 'oh, what a wonderful life'.  Epigenesis - Like taking the TV remote from a 5 year old."
24460,King Arthur - Fallen Champions,"Pretty disappointing attempt at a traditional RPG using the King Arthur: the Roleplaying Wargame as a source. The original game and all its expansions are fantastic, but this standalone has such terrible gameplay that it's essentially unplayable. Don't buy it unless you're getting it automatically as part of a King Arthur bundle--in which case, play all of the others and don't even install this one."

244690,Face Noir,boring to me
244710,Shelter 1,"I got bored of this game after only a short time. It might be because I'm more into action-packed games, or ones where I literally get to create the world around me. Shelter was too slow to be interesting, but too fast-paced to be relaxing."
244730,Divekick,"How MP controls are handled were a immediete turn off for me - The game, for no legitimate reason, handles online MP controls like you're playing a co-op match.  The games gimmick is 'streamlined' controls, so while the lack of mouse controls in a match is understandable, I really dislike that it doesn't let you use the mouse for menu movement.   I'll just say one thing - Minimalistic controls worked back in the past, but there ARE reasons why we moved away from the basic '2 key only' control setups.  "
244770,StarMade, Early Access Review
24480,King Arthur II - The Role-playing Wargame,"The game is broken, When you try to start a campaign via new capmaign there is literally no options, many others have had this problem, the problem was unresolved, initially posted in March 2012 I don't think 4 years on its gonna get fixed.   https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/king-authur-ii-starts-but-no-campaigns-are-available.597744/  DO NOT BUY. 0/10"

244850,Space Engineers, Early Access Review
244870,Electronic Super Joy,"The platforming require nigh pixel-perfect precision if you want to make your jumps. At that point, it's as much luck as it is skill if you manage to complete a level. The soundtrack is well made from a technical standpoint, but it's also just brostep/generic electronic shlock, and being well-made shlock isn't the best selling point. Most importantly, however, is the 'humor'. It borders on 'SPORK' levels of lolsorandumb to the point that I'm pretty sure I developed some sort of brain ulcer reading all of it."
244890,Velocity®Ultra,"Tight controls, interesting mechanics, decent graphics. This game feels like it's begging for speed runners completionists. Fun for a bit, but yuo need that OCD component where you really want to beat your own (or someone sles' ) hgih score."
244910,Homesick,"While this game has beautiful designs, and an intriguing storyline. It is far too short to be worth $15. I bought this game after watching part of a playthrough on YouTube. I though it would be a great game, and unfortunately I found out that I had watched all but the last 30-40 minutes of the game.  IMHO game is too short.  Nominated for write in category of 'WORST GAME EVER MADE' for 2016 Steam Awards."
244930,SNOW, Early Access Review
244950,Where is my Heart?,"This game was released as part of the PSN Mini collection for the original PSP (and PS3) in 2011. Then it was one of the definitive indie gems on the PSP platform, even if only for the lack of competition. Today it's just one mediocre pixel puzzler of many, making it very hard to recommend. The PSN version of course also had gamepad support, which this port lacks."
2450,Bloody Good Time,"I bought this game back in like 2013 and I loved it. Now, the game has no more players on it, and I don't even have it installed anymore. The gameplay is meh, and the characters are all the same. In terms of creativity, this gets a 0. If you compare it to titles like battlefield 1 and call of duty infinite warefare, it is way worse. Bad graphics and no more players. This game gets a 10/10."
245010,Deathtrap Dungeon,"i can't imagine anyone finding this game enjoyable and not just quitting after entering the second room of the first level, but i guess some people can find this clunky dungeon crawler mess enjoyable for the 'so-bad-it's-good' factor, but for me, it doesn't come close to that.  ALSO: dem controls man OH man"
245050,SpellForce 2 - Demons of the Past,"I recommend this game to Spellforce fans 100%. To new peeps, check Faith in Destiny first.  As opposed to Faith in Destiny, which is the previous installement in the series, it starts with RTS style right away, rather than with slow-paced RPG. Then you get to RPG for a while.  I haven't finished it yet but it's totally worth my time. The eleven godtrials (oh my, spoiler here) were entertaining, bar the annoying stealth one. And you get to visit the biggest city in the entire franchise, built up with a new tileset.  It's got lots of sidequests, for if you like traveling the lands. And it's got item sets too, which honestly are one of the best introductions FiD brought to the franchise.  A bit buggy, but it's not game-breaking. It's got a bit more of the middle-of-dialog autosaving than FiD, but that's not unbearable. It's got an annoying two-people talking at the same time thing though, which has happened a couple times, but oh well.  The cheesy humor is on a rampage however, which couldn't be more satisfying. Ex:  Mysterious voice: Proceed to the next trial. *A while later* Mysterious voice: Proceed to the next trial. *Next time around* Avatar: *imitates mysterious voice* Proceed to the next trial. Mysterious voice: Proceed to the. LAST. trial.  Lol 10/10  *Sees a dead character's spirit* Avatar: heeeey! Spirit: you seem surprised to see me Avatar: well last time I saw you you were a bit more... solid.  Lol 10/10"
245150,The Novelist,"Not a huge fan of the relatively static cycle of the game. The plot grew interesting only once in a while and I found that the gameplay hindered my experience by desyncing me from the narrative flow, really lengthening the amount of time in between the story bits which drove me to enjoy the game."
245170,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,  A well made fighting game full of waifus  Do I need to say anymore?
245280,ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition,"Old gem thats underappreciated. Needs a few tweaks, 30 seconds. Linear story action/puzzle platformer designed to make you care for the characters. Really good facial animations and subtle but emotionally charge undertones.

245300,Disney Epic Mickey 2,"11/10  The game brought back Oswald, probably my most favorite cartoon character, even more than Mickey.  Pros: - Brought back Oswald - Costumes affect gameplay - Camera controls are easy (honestly, i have no idea why peeps hate them) - No crashes (only crashes if you launch DEM2.exe, I did Launch.exe, and it worked fine)  Cons: - Pressing New Game overwrites your old save file, requiring you to start over. Luckily, this does not reset your achievement progress."
245370,Etherium,"Ok so I am pretty wound up about this game. The way you create units that can only be dropped at your base point might not be a problem if you didn't have to be at your base telling it specifically were to drop the units rather than setting a waypoint or points that created units get delivered to which means you can never concentrate on your battles. By the end of the maps your base is far from the final battles that you just spend time mini map jumping. The idea of nodes on the bases is a promising one but it never really delivers much. I know this is not made by a big studio and it is pretty cheap to buy but if all it does is frustrate then I would say save up for Deserts of Kharak, Grey Goo or Ashes of the Singularity all of which are far superior RTS games."
245390,"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream","Messed up game, I love it. Let's hope the computers have mercy on us in the future."
245430,Wizardry 7: Crusaders of the Dark Savant,"yeah, i guess you have to be a true die hard fan of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ games to get the slightest amount of enjoymest from it. In your first battle you'll get your ♥♥♥♥ handed to you and I would say that makes this a bad game.   Do not buy this dogshit title"
245450,Wizardry 8,Waste of money:  Combat is incredibly slow. The graphics are terrible even by 2001 standards. The draw in distance is really short. The world design sucks and is totally forgetable. NPC interaction sucks. Towns are worthless. It is not fun at all.
245470,Democracy 3,"I assume the reader is vaguely familiar with the game mechanics. If not, go watch a youtube video or so...  The problem with making a game about things which are hotly debated matters of public policy is that the player does something expecting one thing to happen but the designer programmed in another consequence and it's not clear which one makes more sense. Of course, the devs tried to compensate for that by tellling you what does what in the menu, but that just complicates things (and hot damn, is it confusing to read). These things should be simple and obvious, that's the hallmark of good design.  "
245490,Trials Fusion,"I bought it, installed it, opened it and got a boner just from the intro 10/10"
245620,Tropico 5,"Oh boy... Where to begin.   Oay so improving graphics is nice... But... Being more defination does not mean their clearer. There is no way to filter trees and aside from clearing them I had one or two diffiulties placing roads that essentially went from a forrest.  Aside from one or two advisers, most did not make it into the new game, so we've lost the interactions between some of the background characters. This banter made your advisrs feel more then just a pretty picture.  Building wise, you had more to Tropico 4 then 5 offers, so the buildings were more varity. Aside from more militry buildings, I cannot say things are overall better. To put it short for every 'improvement' no.5 of this series offered, no.4 offered in a more clunky but better way.   In short... Skip no.5 and stuck with Tropico 4."
245730,Flashback,"With pain in the heart, I have to not suggest this game. Is a good remake with a renforced plot and a fun gameplay, very similar to the 1993 version.  BUT THERE'S A LOT OF BUGS. TOO MANY BUGS.  FlashBUG must be the name, if you ask me. "
246070,Hack 'n' Slash,"The game has some really, REALLY good ideas. There are some crazy good puzzles in the game but holy. crap. The writing. It is the cringiest writing I have ever read. The characters try to be funny but just end up being awkward and stupid. I litterally could'nt get through the game because the dialogue was just so unbearible."
246090,Spacebase DF-9,"They left it, they abandoned it and they cried poor, stupid and 'ITS NOT OUR FAULT' Never purchase this game and never purchase from double fine ever again."
246110,MASSIVE CHALICE,Most uninspired game I quite possibly ever played. I could forgive the very little spent on interesting art variety if the game was not so dreadfully boring. I’m trying to finish at least one whole game of it but I don’t think I could without taking naps. I would definitely have refunded it I spent over 2 dollars.
246280,Happy Wars,"Do I recommend this game? Well that's a hard question as I'm in between saying yes and no. I do enjoy the game when matchmaking decides to be fair and my matches don't drop randomly. Ill go through cons and pros. Yes cons first as you need to hear the bad about this game before getting into it.  Cons:  I came to this game from having played it on Xbox, hopping to find the same amount of joy I had playing it. Truth be told, it wasn't what iexpected. The steam port has a greatly reduced community, the game is extremely far behind in updates compared to the Xbox version and on top of that it has all the annoying glitches that I had to put up with on the Xbox such as:  1. Random drops and disconnection from the server/matches(it doesn't happen all the time but it will happen to you eventually).  2. Getting placed against end-game players: This is a huge drawback as the equipment system in the game allows you to get ridiculously overpowered resulting in a huge disadvantage against lower tier players.   3. Super premium items: No you don't have to use premium currency to get your hands on one but it takes time to get one and get a good one for a specific class. I think the Xbox port has this system where you can actually level up an item to premium then super premium once you max out its level but again the steam port is VERY far behind in updates.   4. Small Player base: Get use to seeing the same guy over and over and over. Especially the guy with max level items all of which are lvl15.  5. Hit detection: You chase a guy running away, hit him a few times, and he suffers 0 damage. On the other hand if he hits you, you take damage and your health doesn't magically regenerate in 2 seconds...which oddly enough seems like every one has even if they don't have the perk to increase health regeneration.   Well now on to the pros:  1. Fun game and light atmosphere: When you're not raging against having to fight op players, this game is really f****** fun.   2. Defense is meaningful: nobody stays back and defends the castle 90% of the time but if you decide to (and pray god you picked a cleric or engineer as they are the only classes that can build turrets) you can very well become mvp and # 1 player on your team and secured the win.  3. Nice map designs: Not too big, not too small. Has good atmosphere but some maps need more depth into them.  4. Co-op isn't a bad option to play this game: Pvp can and WILL get frustrating and make you want to contemplate suicide... well not that last part but sometimes it isn't sunshine and rainbows. Co-op is a nice change of pace and killing bots after bots is a nice stress reliever. Not to mention you get about the same amount of xp and currency just like in multiplayer, minus the league points.   Overall it is a nice game and seeing what it can be (Xbox version) I have high hopes the steam port here will eventually redeem itself. Its a fun game, few bumps here and there but it isn't complete garbage."

24640,Trainz: Classic Cabon City,Not actually a game. DLC repackaged as an unplayable game.

24670,Trainz Simulator 12,"I really wanted to like this game. I really truly did, as it was a game I had on my wishlist for months if not years. So naturally, when the Winter sale came around, and I got some money, I went ahead and bought it, ignoring the reviews that discuss performance issues in regards to lag and stuttering in the game.  Once it was done downloading I started it up and was actually excited to start driving trains around. That was until it had to update and download a few hundered thousand assets. 'Okay, it's a new game so I can understand it having to download some stuff.' It didn't take too long to do (5 minutes roughly) and then I was all set to go.  First time starting it ran just fine however, the second time that I started it, I decided to check out the content manager to see what there was to download. So the content manager opens, and it works for about 5 minutes or so before it locks up. Naturally, I bring up task manager and close it down and wait for it to stop running on Steam to try again.Except it doesn't. I let it go for 15 minutes before force closing steam itself and restarting it.  Needless to say, the 7 hours I have logged into this game are mostly issues with the content creator freezing up or the game having to delete and update assets. Very little of the time has been spent actually in game, which, once it's loaded in and works, I have no issues with at all, even in regards to performance issues.  Overall, no I would not recommend this game as it is rather buggy in the curret version and it appears that it will stay this way as N3V has T:ANE to focus on.  TL;DR - Spend money elsewhere because this game is full of bugs that don't even allow you to get to the game itself."
246720,Wayward Manor,"Despite having completed it, I can't tell you what this game is about. I had no idea what I was doing and just clicked random stuff for three hours, trying to find a pattern.   In some ways it was similar to The Amazing Maze (Das Verrueckte Labyrinth) or pool/billard, maybe. It probably sounded like a fabulous idea on paper. You push items, and they either move to a new place, or push each other, or nothing happens. Was there a strategy that I was meant to use, apart from random clicking? I will never know.  If I were a child, the painfully distorted character models would give me nightmares. Being an adult, I had nightmares because each level was a kafka-esque loop of slightly delayed sprite movement and repetitive audio.   I wanted to like this game, Neil Gaiman being involved and all, but I cannot recommend it."

246880,Recruits, Early Access Review
246900,Viscera Cleanup Detail,"The concept was great. The intent was great. I love innovation and developers trying new things. However, the execution fell apart to where the game's flaws outshine any fun that might be had trying to play the game. When it feels like doing the actual physical work that the game entails is easier and more satisfying that playing the game, it's hard to keep going. I hope they look at the issues and make a sequel that addresses them. When they do, I may give it another shot, but I can't with what they put out."
246920,Bombernauts, Early Access Review
246940,Lords of the Black Sun,"This game is trash. Very simple with very little content. I got this game during early access expecting it to become a great but the devs abandoned it too quickly. As it is the 'game' is currently a $30 beta with only a few races, some very dummed down economy and democracy and boring gameplay. Under no circumstance should you buy this game."

247000,Talisman: Digital Edition,Good board game for PC! The only disadvantage of this game is its overly random nature. Dice is the king! Thats why it can be rather long (3 human players and 1 AI lasts about 2-3 hours in average).
247020,"Cook, Serve, Delicious!",This game...this game...you just can't stop playing this game. There is plenty to do and a bunch of modes that make you want to go nuts - YET! You don't stop. You can have everything and still enjoy it to the fullest. and Second One is coming out?! A CSD crazy good dream! Thank you for making this wonderful game! :D

247120,Portal 2 Sixense Perceptual Pack,..
247140,Soundodger+,I picked this game up on sale and found it to be well worth it. It isn't like many other games of similar genre that stop when you get hit and make you start over. You get a % at the end and continue from start to finish. I have enjoyed playing and will probably at least play to unlock every level. If you think you might like it at all watching the preview video I'd say you should pick it up. It will not disappoint.
247240,Volgarr the Viking,"This game was made as a love-letter to a very specific sort of gamer and game experience. I come to this title though more as an outsider, someone who played some 90s games but never really went to arcades or spent dozens of hours perfecting the way I finished one specific game level. I came to this game mostly based on a few friend recommendations and some gameplay clips, as a fan of pixel-art and platforming.  The Good: I really admire this game's design focus. After just a few minutes of play it was obvious that the developers had a specific vision for this game and they pursued that vision with dogged determination. Everything that did not directly support their vision was stripped out, leaving a pure experience behind. Read the developer's description of the game and you will find it closely matches what gameplay is actually like (the description is not full of hype but cold hard facts). For me it felt so much like a 90s platformer that when Steam notifications popped up during gameplay it was almost jarring.   The Bad: Because this game is so focused on giving the player a specific experience if you find you don't like that experience the game quickly loses all charm. You progress through levels by memorizing every step of the level, learning when to throw spears off screen to kill enemies you haven't even seen yet and where exactly to stand to avoid attacks that haven't even started yet. There is no room for different play-styles, personal touches, or emergent storytelling of any kind. There is almost no randomness or exploration of any kind, with this game rewarding players who have the memory and finger-precision to do the same thing over and over. As a result the game is as brutish as the titular Viking, and as exacting as his well-sharpened sword. And that's okay because that is what this game is supposed to be. Just make sure that what you want from this game matches what this game is designed to give you, otherwise it will just be a waste of your time and money.  The Verdict: I recommended this game because it does what it is supposed to do, and it does it very well. If what you have read about this game so far is really resonating with you this game will likely be a good buy. But I personally did not enjoy my time with it, mostly because it doesn't match my own gaming tastes. There are a few friends I know though who still love their old platformers, and I might just let them know that this game exists."
247310,Gravi, Early Access Review
247350,Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator,"Although it looks like it was made 15 years ago, it's still fun for a bit.  My only desire is that the game had more content in the way of missions etc. If there's a number2 I will defs buy it."
247370,Mutant Mudds Deluxe,"Solid platformer, I liked it. Responsive controls and fun gameplay. Starts off easy but gets more challenging at later levels."
247430,Hitman: Contracts,"This is another great Hitman game, im a huge fan of this franchise since the first one so i have to recommend this to anyone who likes hitman &lt;3"
247580,Magicka: Wizards of the Square Tablet,Dank mobile port can spam health and god mode activate
247660,Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut,"Game itself is great, this port is horrible. Those interested should play the original version on the Xbox 360 - it has better, warmer colours and more fitting textures. Directors cut version also adds few things to the game that make it worse than the original.   This PC port (- even with the DPfix) is filled with crashes, strange framerate issues and other technical woes. Beating the final boss is almost impossible due to the aiming bug that persists trough out the whole game (some might have luck with messing win98 compatibility modes or alt-tabing – I didn’t).  That said, I enjoyed it but find really hard to recommend this version of the game to any one."

24780,SimCity 4 Deluxe,"The tutorials are horrible, the HUD is horribly small and horrible and the guides aren't helping at all. I stick to SimCity 2013, that game might be a bit buggier, but atleast you have a good interface HUD. Stick to SimCity 2013, even with Origin. They're on a big sale anyway. Don't let the positive e-mails saying 'Better than SimCity 2013' fool you."
24790,Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars,Multiplayer was taken down but good RTS overall.
247910,Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2,"Ok, so I was very excited about recieving a new computer and downloaded this and many other games on the lovely Steam winter sale. I have an i5 processor and an NVIDIA GEFORCE graphics card, and booted up this trainwreck and got about 5 frames per second. Have you ever had ten squeakers screaming in your ear to shoot the zombie on the left but you're basically playing a slideshow so you can do nothing and they continue to complain in you're ear until their mother's tell them it's their bedtime? You will experience this unless you have an AMD processor, so, best of luck."
247950,Sacred 3,"I didn't play Sacred 1 &amp; 2 yet, so unlike many other reviews, I'm not comparing it to the previous titles (as I understand it's not made by the same company anyway, someone bought the rights). My judgement here is based purely on the games own merrit.   The game has good graphics, controls and general gameplay are O.k. but nothing special (except the evade command, it throws you in totally random directions and as such is quite terrible). I also would say the voice acting isn't bad... but the actual scripts the voice actors had to read are REALLY REALLY bad. I feel sorry for them. Whoewer wrote the scripts has no idea what a fantasy RPG entails. It's simply terrible. You defeat some enemys and as you pick up loot you hear stuff like (and I quote) ''Sexy!'' or ''O baby!'' or ''Feels good!''. There is also no atmosphere in the game worth mentioning.   If you want to even remotely enjoy the game, turn the character voices OFF! You also might want to considder turning off the games music and using your own for better atmosphere."
24800,Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Uprising,"I have played through Red Alert 2, Yuri's Revenge, Command &amp; Conquer Tiberium War and Firestorm, Emperor Battle for Dune, Command &amp; Conquer Generals and Zero Hour, Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds and Clone Campaigns, Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert 3 and Command &amp; Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars all of them Westwood/EA offerings and I have been able to battle through the first scenario in each of these games except Red Alert 3 Uprising. How do you battle an enemy you cannot target and shoot but it can take you out with one salvo, it beats me (everytime)? Most unplayable piece of dreck ever."
24810,Command and Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath,"Very fun C&amp;C game. Best one you can get on steam.  Be wary buyer, They no longer have server support from gamespy.   However, fans of the command and conquer series have gotten together to create/buy/rent their own servers for ALL the command and conquer games.  However, there is a process to go through if you want to play multiplayer on them  Yet, this game does of an interesting story and fun single player skirmish mode  Generals&gt;Red alert 2&gt;C&amp;C 3/wrath&gt;---------------------------------------------C&amp;C4"

Buy it, and always - ALWAYS - send Cilia."
248310,Freedom Planet,Freedom Planet. The first good Sonic game to come out since Sonic &amp; Knuckles.
248330,Dino Run DX,"Great game that brought me back to my childhood always fun to play.    One comment though; the steam achievement system does not work for me (I'm on a mac), and this somewhat bothers me seeing blank achievements on simple stuff like 2x dactyl chain or something that I clearly did. So if there's a way I can fix that it would be greatly appreciated"

Started a new game on a harder setting,.... nothing is much harder i mean yeah mobs have more life hit harder.. but thats not hard.. what they done was made it so when dwarfs are doing a task.. they just stop and ponder about nothing more offten, this cancels their orders and they then look for a new task, while doing the new task they stop and ponder again.. repeat this process for all dwarfs with execption to 2 out of 7.. Two of them finish the task, end result lots of wasted time.. i mean really not just in game but irl... who wants to game out so you can have all your commands dismissed with 1 or 2 done here or there... needless to say as you can see by the long list of beep i have listed below..The game is a gem if somebody actually cared bout quality and the user.... but hey just give em ur dollars..

248410,Legends of Aethereus,  Abandonware.. Sorry chaps! Good game as it stands but for this price unless you have four friends I highly suggest you do not pick up this game.
248450,Salvation Prophecy,"Yeah this game has got some nice style and I like the idea of it on a conceptual level, but the gameplay is super basic. I would rather do another re-run of Galactic Conquest in Star Wars Battlefront 2 any day. Now that has got some truly fun land and space combat."
248470,Doorways: Prelude,"The game is for beginner dungeon crawlers. The puzzles are super predictable. The graphics and some of the scenes are put together nicely, but the game itself could easily be beaten in 2 hours tops... In other words, this is not a very long game. It was actually shockingly short. The soundtrack loops and is also shockingly short. About the scariest part of this game is wondering how long it will take before you ram a screwdriver in your ear and put your head through the monitor. The game is totally worth like 3-5$. I just finished the second in the series and it was a bit longer, but the very end of it was excrutiatingly frustrating. Neither game is at all challenging to the mind, the only challenge is trial and error. As in, you already know exactly what to do, but the game is so petty and precise on some stupid timing trick that you have to be at a perfect distance to the last pixel, I literally was down to my last try to finish the 2nd in the series before I rage quit. You will know the part I'm talking about..."
248490,1953 - KGB Unleashed,"It is really hard, random and interesting at the same time, if you like puzzles I recommend"
248510,Dominions 3,"If you don't have dominions 4 and don't plan on waiting for that to go on sale, this is still a solid entry to the strategy genre. There are quite a few ui improvements absent from 3 as opposed to 4, and the win conditions are more simplistic, but you still won't find a better strategy pick if you're willing to overlook the old-looking graphics.  Also, as I understand it, the multiplayer scene has moved on from 3 to 4, so it may be better for playing alone."
248530,Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive,"Is a callming game. Is nice. Is not so funny, but you see fishes, so is good."
248550,Megabyte Punch,"Remember Custom Robo? ... No? ... Well it's like if that were a sidescroller and had a knockback combat system similar to Smash. If you don't know what Smash is, I don't know what to tell you."
248570,Toribash,Its free so why not just give it a try?
248610,Door Kickers,This has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. I'm constantly learning new things I can do to improve my times and cut back on casualties. I am extremely happy with what I paid for. Though I do have an immense dislike for the execution style missions...
248630,Kingdoms Rise, Early Access Review
248650,Draw a Stickman: EPIC,game sucks rips off WOW
24870,Need for Speed: SHIFT,When you turn up the AI ability the only thing it does is make them more able to do things that aren't possible and allow them to take you out and off the track . So I found myself just bashing my way through and getting in the lead and racing by myself over and over again. The game should have an AI that allows the car to drive along side and race you cleanly. These are mostly a waste of time and after racing a forcefeedback steering wheel for 10 laps and then getting rammed off the track ..... over and over again well that gets not to be very fun and if you run it on low ability your out in front by the first turn. Any of these car games where the sole aim of the AI is to knock you off the track in officall races are a waste of time..... I deleted mine Im done putting in alot of time and then just getting wrecked.

248800,Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos,"Interesting story. It really is a shame Dischan went under, I was looking forward to a sequel. I'm not sure how it would have worked out though with the artist who did this one leaving. I didn't like the early art for the second one nearly as much. Not much point in buying this here - you can pick it and it's soundtrack up for free on Dischan's website, under downloads: dischandotco It's definitely worth the bandwidth if you ask me."
248820,Risk of Rain,"Risk of Rain, simply put, is a sci-fi action-adventure rogue-like game.  Risk of Rain, specifically put, is the most amazing badass side-scrolling sci-fi shooter I have ever seen. It has more content than almost any other rogue-like game I've ever seen, and is close to perfection in every way.  Pros: -Around 15 different classes to choose from, each with their own upsides and downsides to get used to. -Dozens of different items to collect, each giving you specific passive boosts or qualities to add a little quality to what will almost always be your short life. -A great many activated items, which can do anything from launching missiles to placing a torch that fears and damages enemies to even sacrificing a small portion of your health to instantly kill the closest enemy to you (yes, that includes BOSSES). -Several different environments, all with their own unique layouts. -A very uniquely challenging aspect: as time forges on, so does the difficulty. In other words, the longer you live, the less likely you are to continue living. -Although not many, there are a few story elements, such as item and monster logs to show you what you're dealing with.  Cons: -Even the easiest difficulty is very challenging for new players. It took me around 5 games to get used to it enough to get past the 2nd stage. -You begin with only the Commando class, which most players consider the worst class in the game. It also can take quite a lot of effort and skill to unlock some of the characters. -Monsters have a tendency to spawn very frequently once you reach around the 6-minute mark. -You must activate a teleporter to transition between levels, and during this time, monsters spawn much more often than they already do, and a powerful boss spawns to make it an even greater challenge to live. -Pressing Ctrl+Esc in the middle of the game will hide it as normal, but there isn't always something in the taskbar for you to click to pull it back up. Even in windowed mode, the taskbar shows no signs of the game being open. If this happens, it also becomes impossible to reopen it with Steam without restarting the computer, as it will bring up a window saying the 'app is already running'. (NOTE: Even if this happens, it may randomly add itself to the taskbar, allowing you to re-enter the game and resume play as normal. However I am not sure of what causes this to happen.) -Exiting a current run brings it to an end instead of saving progress, just as if you had died.   In my belief, however, the ups heavily outweigh the downs. This game is obscenely fun and difficult to stop playing once you've started.  9/10  P.S. The Commando class is actually a good one to have to start out with. He is capable of hitting enemies on the edge of the screen with ease, and his attacks can knock back most enemies, keeping them at bay temporarily. He also has a dodge roll that grants him immunity to all damage until he completes the roll. Overall, he can be very easy to get used to, and getting a lot of items that apply on-hit effects can be ridiculous on him."

249190,Ancient Space,"Oh, so you wanted to quick-save before jumping to another sector? Too bad, all saves are already filled.  Units are so bleak, they had to put a fat unit icon over them, so that you can distinguish a frigate from a worker.  You can conquer half the map, build dozens of stations, but you're still stuck with 12 unit points.  After a few missions you'll have come up with a winning strategy. Rinse and repeat henceforth."
249230,Risen 3 - Titan Lords,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. Hell, it was a new Piranha Bytes release, and I LOVE these devs. However, I'm not sure what's going on with them after seeing this. Sadly, I would have taken more consideration into pre-ordering it had I known what Risen 2 ended up being, as PB in my opinion has had a relatively solid track record with their games, with titles that were at least good enough for me to pitch in and support them, and that's saying something in most cases.  I've been a Piranha Bytes fan to the core when it comes to their RPGs since I had the manual dexterity to use a keyboard, and Gothic was actually my first RPG experience. Even to this day, I have a hard time finding games in the RPG sector that manage to captivate me as much as G1 and G2 did.  However, this isn't a Gothic 1 or Gothic 2 review. This is a Risen 3 review, so let's get on with it.  What really ruined it for me:  The Combat - - - - - - This was the first thing I noticed when I began playing the game, and I have to say PB fell flat on their face with this one. First and foremost, the main character has about as much ability in using a sword as a dead cat, and he's about as stalwart as one, too. His attacks have an atrocious wind up that make even the simplest combat situations into an ordeal of timing and hoping the enemies don't hit you first, which brings me to my next subject: Enemies have NO WIND UP to balance this out. Just about everything you encounter and fight in the game will attack you relentlessly and without any kind of delay, meaning that if you go in and swing at the enemy, they can just attack and interrupt you, doing damage and bringing you back to square one. Oh, and that's another thing. EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING stuns your character. Tiny-♥♥♥ beach insect thing? (I still have yet to understand those creatures.) Yeah, their tiny attack will stagger your character the same way you'd expect him to if he got clocked upside the head by Chuck Liddell.  As a whole, this results in an absolutely infuriating combat experience that was one of the main reasons I had to put the game down for good. It's completely unbearable, and frankly I've come to expect far more from these developers.  Now, I know, I've seen it everywhere. People could say that Gothic's combat was just as awful, if not worse, but there's a key difference there: Gothic's combat is anything but horrible, for one. If anything, it's about all you should expect from an RPG from around the year 2000; on the other hand, this game from 2015 manages to have combat that, unlike Gothic, doesn't just take a bit of time to get a hang of, but instead is completely impossible to work with and that, in my opinion, makes the experience null and void. I even used cheats to increase my combat skill in hopes of making my character's attacks worthwhile, and even THIS did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  In terms of major flaws, this really is the only one, and it manages to be so outstandingly, so GLORIOUSLY bad that the game is completely ruined by it.  Now, the game has some things that I like about it, namely the fact that it really does feel like a Piranha Bytes game still. The dialogue, characters, world, and music all still make me feel like I'm playing a good old PB game, but once I get into a fight I simply can't force myself to get through the whole thing.  Now, for an open recommendation for the developers and a closing statement:  You clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s have given me gaming experiences throughout my entire life, and I absolutely adore you all for it. I've often burst out in laughter from the Hero's dialogue options and an NPC's response, as well as the numerous easter eggs and goodies you leave lying around. This, just as often as I've have slammed my fist down on my desk in frustration from the challenging and punishing, yet rewarding combat experience, but this game hardly managed to do any of that for me, as the whole thing was sadly cut short by its one fatal flaw. When I say this next bit, I want you guys to know (and this goes to other readers as well) that I'm not just putting on the nostalgia blinders; I just know a working formula when I see it.  Hypothetically, if you lot made another RPG, regardless of if it's Risen or something new entirely, and you used the same formula for G1 and G2 (here's where you could call me out on nostalgia blindness, if it weren't for the fact that an overwhelming number of your fans will show agreement) and adapted it for a modern market, using a newer engine with better graphics and the like, it would probably end up being another great installment; and, when I say 'formula' I'm talking about everything that made the first two Gothic games what they were, from the controls to the stats. Hell, you could make it on the old G2 engine and it'd probably still be great, but if there's one thing I'll admit, it's that the controls, while not inherently bad and not in need of outright change, could definitely use a tune up to make it feel a bit more fluid and responsive.  At this point, I doubt anything in the paragraph above will happen, but I do sincerely believe it'd do the team a lot better than what they're going with as of now. Some things don't need to change, and it really does seem like the games started going downhill once the controls went through the big overhaul they did starting with Gothic 3, which changed the other two games' main control drawback of being somewhat stiff at times and generally feeling rather old-school to making the whole thing just feel outright clumsy. Risen 3 seems to have marked the apex of this clumsiness, and it's so atrocious that I couldn't even recommend this to my worst enemy.  Hopefully this review shed some light for players on the fence about getting it and why I sincerely believe they should just go to GOG and buy one of the Gothic games instead. (It's probably obvious which two I recommend.) If you can be a proper human and adapt to the controls that are most definitely different from what most are accustomend to, you'll find what is an experience that is worlds better than what this title provides, and possibly one that you may find unforgettable."
249330,Unholy Heights,A lot more addicting than it seems!
249360,Zafehouse: Diaries,"This game was something I went in wanting to like. However this game has some very clunky mechanics, and can be rather hard to follow and understand in the begining, which makes it very hard to get into at all. I gave it a little under half an hour of trying it out and gave up and refunded it. Here's hoping they streamline the mechanics just a little for the sequal. The strategy part seems solid, but the rest of the mechanics just bring everything to a halt pretty quickly."
249550,NEStalgia,"It's basically a Nes game with MMO elements. You have several diverse classes with skill trees, you can play with friends and recruit monsters to help, something that i think is REALLY lacking in Rpgs.   In other words, you can be a warlock using your hp to perform powerful attacks that heal you more than hurt you and be a pokemon master at the same time, bringing 2 strong monster allies. You can build your team in anyway you can, such as having a really strong monster healer, a physical tank that takes all sorts of damage and crushes the opposition, while you're using magic, firing arrows or being another tank yourself. Whatever the strategy, NEStalgia has you covered.  Just don't mind the random battles..."
249590,Teslagrad,Beautiful game design! Love the physics of the game! Congrats to the game developers :D Enjoyed every second of it! I want more Teslagrad
24960,Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2,why can't I play this game?
249610,Galactic Arms Race,"Nope just that one fun gimmicky game mechanic like the weapon system is not enough to save this shallow as can be shooter with such cookie cutter mission design. You know when you have to play those boring tutorial modes just to learn the basics of most games, right? Well the whole of this game feels just like one big repetitive never ending boring tutorial mode for sure."

24980,Mass Effect 2 (2010),"One of the best games of history. One of the worst companies. The DLC you can acquire via steam are ok, but you have to buy from EA the really good ones that complete the game and they cost more tha the game bought via Steam..."

249990,FORCED,Fun game but all the bugs make it impossible to enjoy
2500,Shadowgrounds,"Hey, it's an alright top down shooter. Not the hardest but it's fun for the few hours it takes to beat this game."
250030,Lilly Looking Through,"Yes, I recommend this game. It's a very fun, engaging point-and-click adventure. There isn't a lot of reading. There isn't a lot of talking. The puzzles were mildly challenging at the most. This would be a good game for a younger teen or someone older who wants a bit of relaxing adventure.  It WAS short. I'm not usually one to begrudge a game's length but this felt short even to me. They've definitely set it up for a sequel and I will definitely be looking for it."
250050,Life Goes On,"A very creative and new idea/perspective of how to look at deaths in a game. Life Goes On is a fun game, that hides some tricky puzzles up its sleave. Definitely recommend this, especially with a controller."

250110,Assault Android Cactus, Early Access Review
250180,METAL SLUG 3,An old school favorite good visuals and simple but hard to master gameplay 
250320,The Wolf Among Us,"There are many many reasons to not like this, but in the end it comes down to whether or not you can over look numerous irritants and issues of varying degree in order to let the game tell you the story.  The first of which is the fact that the game just might not start at all because of know issues the developers don't care about fixing -- issues you almost cannot hope to get past since they all instantly kill the game before it starts without ever telling the user anything about the problem the game encountered.  You really have to love the story and even then you should consider reading the original comic book since it does a better job at telling the story than this game ever will.  So just don't."
250340,Blockland,You know that trailer? With the jets and helicopters and all that cool stuff? Yeah... it doesn't have that.
250360,MovieWriterPro,"As an aspiring screenwriter, I find this program sensational. It is now the only one I want to use. Other users have adressed faults with formatting, a lack of guide to how traditional scripting works, a need for more features, etc. The thing is though, if you know what it is you're doing, this programme no longer has those faults. All it takes is a quick search in google for 'screenplay template' or 'Format samples' or something along those lines. Once you have that information, this app is a dream. with inputs such as: Info, synopsis, characters, places, notes, statistics, and other elements, in addition to the script, keeping on track is very easy. There is also a shotcut key at the bottom of the window that makes everything very intuitive. I found myself more motivated in my writing whilst using this program purely due to ease of use, and lack of needing to self-format (format manually) You should account the negative reviews to a lack of interest/effort. Once you get going with this, you won't need, nor want for another scriptwriting program. It is more suited for screenplays, but also works well for stage plays."
250380,Knock-knock,"Why do doors randomly not open at times? Prompting the open door button multiple times to go through a door is not fun, especially when the gameplay involves opening doors every 20 seconds.  I also hate the gibberish voice of the main character."
250400,How to Survive,Hmm i dont think that game really good. When a zombie group attacks you in real life one damage will kill you.. but in this game you can bomb zombies.. &amp; fight melee.. or ranged weapons.  That game not satisfy that money..
250420,8BitMMO,"This is the worst blackscreen simulator ever. It shows a page where I can enter all my data like e-mail address, password and so and then a black screen appears. other black screen simulators don't take so much time. you just open them and: BAAAM! blackscreen. I found Obama's face in a blackscreen simulator once. took me 5 hours to find him but anyway: this blackscreen simulator is no a good idea!"
250460,Bridge Constructor,"This game was great while it worked. The game will not launch since the last auto game update on the STEAM game portal. I can restore my system and play the game if I turn my wifi connection off, however the game is unlaunchable as soon as I connect to the steam portal in ONLINE mode, so basically useless."
250520,Underrail,Post-apocalyptic in the best of old style like first Fallout. I recommend to those who liked Fallout 1&amp;2
250540,C-Wars, Early Access Review
250560,Fight The Dragon,"I apologize if you bought this game because of my first review. I am retracting all of that. Hate to do this, I want to like this game. Truth is, I just do not.  The game works pretty well, and you can even use the editor with just a gamepad. The combat is only okay. There has always been something about it that just feels stiff..  I guess I shouldn't complain, I got my money's worth in play time. The funnest part is using the editor. I made one level and published it that took quite awhile, but I didn't want to make another one because there aren't enough assets to make it very different.  So that's the overall problem. Each level feels the same because they all draw from the same small pool of assets. For example the game only has about 20 monsters or so. Quite a while back the devs said they agreed with this and planned to add lots of stuff but they never did. The workshop could be a solution to this, but it isn;t because you can only skin your own character, that's it.  They continue to to update the game a little bit here and there, but I think they consider it mostly finished. It's not all bad I just wish that the time I took to learn making my own edventure could be rewarded with inspiration to use it more and create many more levels. I feel like I wasted my time with it and hope to save some others from maybe doing the same.  I think the 10-13 age group could maybe like it a lot. Hard to say, the learning curve is a bit high with the editor. It never really caught on for my 10 year old either."
250580,Paranautical Activity: Deluxe Atonement Edition,A First Person Binding Of Isaac the gameplay is fun but the menus and content is very limited
250600,The Plan,Expecting a pointless fly simulator.  End up retrospecting about life.  I'd recommend this. Also please turn on your speaker for immersive experience.
250620,Among the Sleep,"Short, fairly simple 1st person adventure game with the gimmick that you are a toddler. Kinda vague ending, not sure if my interpretation of what happens is correct (although the prologue chapter, which I played last, kinda confirms). Sort of a baby's first Amnesia: TDD (pun somewhat intended). Worth an afternoon, probably much more intense in VR if that's an option (and it seems like it should be)."
250640,[Old Edition] Croixleur Sigma,"A simple character action game with a good feel to it. There are a lot of weapons with slight twists, and two characters, so it has good replay value. It's pretty cheap all things considered. For fans of the genre."
250660,Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils,By far the most enjoyable and intuitive Castlevania style game that I have ever played.
250700,Super Time Force Ultra,"this game is based of one of the best ♥♥♥♥ing games i've ever had the honor of playing! based of contra/metal slug, this game rips your nipples off with hardcore adrelaline!"
250720,Starlight Inception,Horrible and Cheap
250740,Ragnarok Online - Free to Play - European Version,"Well... Launcher opened up fine. Thats the one redeeming quality this game has.  Past that the launcher is partially in French, and also has three main buttons... 'play','replay' and 'exit'. Replay didn't even make sense to me, but when I clicked it, it seemed to just reopen the launcher.  Then an options button on the side that takes you to a Windows 95 style options menu. This menu can only change options outside the game and if it doesn't work right, tough. It looks like your spending time resetting the client to ♥♥♥♥ around with this menu.  The options are bugged based on the fact it took me a good 5 attempts to get this to even display outside of a tiny box in my screen (even though options were set full screen it was displaying a tiny box that looked like a cutout section of the login screen). The login screen music is reminiscent of the old Final Fantasy days which made me feel nostalgic. Ok so finally I get to give this game a chance.  Then I finally get to the login screen and enter my login name I chose, only to have a French popup box give me an error. I check my email and find out they changed my login name from what was accepted for no real reason. After clicking 'memo' which I assume is remember, I login and get greeted by a charecter creator, which has hair style and hair colour... nothing more aside from your starting stat points. I choose a name and a popup says 'taken' then boots me back to the start losing the customisation options anyway.  I finally make a charecter. login and am greeted by black boxes in every block of ground for no reason. I go to the options menu and try to change something but the only option in game is resolution for the sprites and effects.... Clearly much effort shown in this game already.  Then I speak to an NPC who asks me to select a language.  'Great!' I think 'at least I will be able to get rid of the French and finally be able to understand the game now!' then I go to the next NPC who proceeds to ask me math questions in French and then asked me to click which number was displayed, again in French.....  Another few minutes in almost every damn NPC is talking to me in French, which would be fine if I could speak the language but unfortunately aside from a few words I can't nor do I want to learn.  I wanted to give this game a chance but if the developers cannot be bothered to translate the game, I aren't going to do it for them.  Oh and to add insult to injury, these guys are also trying to stop people leaving reviews. You can play for hours but when you actually load the game up it dupes steam into thinking you aren't actually playing anything and Steam just says you are online not in a game. This is done because you can't leave a review till after 5 minutes of playtime.  The only way to bypass this is to constantly load in and out of the game because thats the only time it flashes that your playing a game on Steam for about 5 seconds a time.  I actually wasted time doing this just so I could leave my first ever review on Steam because this crap really made me mad, its one thing using an old popular game to get money but its another running it into the ground and then trying to stop people warning others about it.  A video mini review/rant can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A81I4gDEK4E   TL:DR French, not English. Developers stop you from leaving reviews by not actually placing you in a game on Steam despite playing for hours."
250760,Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove,  In Short -
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I bought it during the winter sale and holy crap. I usually don't play 2D sidescrollers, but the sheer number of upgrades and randomness makes every game unique. Sometimes it feels like nothing can stop you, others makes you feel vulnrables and crying for another heart.  Overwhelmingly fun and satisfying, high replayability factor.  9/11, would melt steel beams again"
251020,Railroad X,"I have played one of the older versions and have gotten the hang of it.  The game has its ups and downs.   for an example, It takes a lot of time to get familiar with the controlls and how the some of the mechanics work. and some of the stuff in the game can easily be extremly overvelming and look some what unnecesary.  but it still has to be said, it is a well made game with a lot of potential and opertunities."
251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"Best RTS I've ever played. Set in 1975-1990 Cold War era, it's practically a warsim with its excellent realism with a heavy emphasis on positioning, planning and combined arms rather than micro. Don't buy this for the singleplayer as it is more a tacked on feature, but it's an amazing multiplayer game, and the multiplayer scene is thriving and very fun. Very high skill cap, and lots of variety in factions too. 10/10 would flank with Vickers for glorious Australia again."
251110,INFRA,"The first half of the game was pretty amazing, the second half became tedious, at the point I got into the steel mill. I didn't finish it as it was just too much running around looking for clues and was getting booring. I went on line on Youtube and followed some other players through the rest of the game and saw the ending, which really wasn't a ending I would have been happy with at all. This game could have been a classic if it was shorter and there was a story line that would finish. Finding the evidence and taking photos should have led up to some sort of reward at the end. I could see getting through all the puzzles, returning to the main office and producing the photo evidence for the boss who would then grade me on how well I did... may a photo album I could look through with sections on the dam, the saw mill, etc. If I did well I might receive a raise and promotion in the story, or if I didn't get much evidence I might be told to go back and get more evidence or told I am fired if I did really badly. This game really needs a follow though ending. The graphics are amazing, incdedible creative surroundings with attention to small details along with excellent ambience sounds and music that comes in just at the right times and with out being overdone. A few human characters along the way would also be a good addition."
251130,Chroma Squad,"after a couple hours of playing you honestly feel like you've done everything...gameplay is pretty repetitive and the character customization (items, skills, stats) just feel bland. It can also be buggy at time, with freezes and just weird bugs... i summoned all my units to the leader and one of the characters ended up behind line of trees that they could not pass...  i really did enjoy the game at the start but as i played it just got boring..."
251150,The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky,"Just finished Chapter 2, should be somewhat halfway through the game I guess... so far all I can say is:  -- If you enjoy JRPGs: you MUST play this!  -- If you enjoy intriguing stories that take their time and enjoy the little things: you MUST play this!  -- If you prefer turn-based combat over the nowadays ubiquitously used 'real time fast paced action!!!!!11'-variant: you MUST play this!  In short, for fans of the classic JRPG genre, I consider this an absolute must have; though the looks are somewhat dated, the overall style and lovingly designed locales paint a pleasant world that entices you to explore and not just rush from one main story mission to the other.  Be advised though that this game is not voiced, so you will be doing A LOT of reading -- for some of us (J)RPG fans that might be good news though, as I for one enjoy text-only games as well as voiceover-ones, since the former just leaves more up to the reader's fantasy to fill in, such as how a certain character would talk, what they'd sound like, etc pp."
251170,Damned,"You are probably thinking: This game is probably fun! I can be monster and scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of my friends! No. Im gonna tell you why. This game is online, 5 players or less per round. 4 survivors one monster. The survivors job is to find keys and unlock doors. The monsters job is to scare the players and later kill them. But for the monster it is almost impossible. There are 3 monsters: Lurker, mary and phantom. The lurker can go invisible and run pretty fast! Sounds cool right? But when you are invisible you can`t see the other players. There is no reason to be invisible. Marry can teleport to random places, but she walk like a snail, can`t decide were to teleport and teleports randomly even though you did not want to. Phantom. Phantom is just horrible. He have no powers at all. He can`t see players, walk, can`t run and the only good thing is when you are basically inside another player you discover them, and you have x-ray vision for like 10 seconds before you can`t see them anymore. 3/10"
251210,Hive,I play with a friend love this game!!
251230,Livelock,"Great game, but it needs more content. played threw it in about 5-6 hours."
251270,Corpse Party,"This game is incredible~ I played the PSP version of this game and I must say this is a port of the actual Windows PC version and it is by far the best version. Although I like the avatars in the PSP version better, this one actually has curse words and more content. I'm a huge fan of the anime and if you are as well or if you enjoyed the PSP version, this version offers slightly more. I highly recommend to any horror fan of this game genre."
251290,The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC,"So this is one of those times when I really wish there were more than 2 ratings for the review. Do I recommend this game - yes, but with a couple caveats.   1. If you liked the game for its story, you'll certainly get more of that here &amp; it's really large-scale - and the characters are really fleshed out, especially agate, but more isn't necessarily better. While I certainly really liked the story in the original, I liked a lot more the experience of being a bracer - I found they created that part really well and somehow that doesn't translate as well into the second game, you are too busy with this main big story for that to happen - there are certainly sidequests, but there's something about it I can't put my finger on. The gameplay just isn't as fun anymore.   2. Lazy developers. 'So, we are going to make a sequel to this game, should be try to put in some new monsters and abilities? Nah, let's just make some contrived plot reasons why the monsters are stronger &amp; give the characters stronger versions of current abilities but call them true ability x or ability x2' - there are some new monsters in the first part of the game and the latter parts, but this was really shoddy. Also, the spells are also exactly the same except you start over from the beginning. I actually thought that was handled well why you do that, but it takes you too long to get any new kind of spells.   3. Joshua - while I new Joshua would not be in it for the mainstay this time around, I did think I would at least see what he is up to - you pretty much don't.  4. If you saw that POS anime - it's largely made up. Not really counting down to the grade, actually it's a good thing - just saying.   So, do I recommend this game? Yes, but it's not nearly as good as the original &amp; you really should get it on sale."
251310,Eleusis,"I'm in a problem with the recommendation, since I've got mixed feelings. So I just do a basic pro-con match.  PRO:  + Very athmospheric, interesting lore and start + Great visuals and audio, that sucks you in + Runs on older configs (my playtime was on an AMD Athlon64, 2 GB DDR1 RAM with an Asus Radeon EAH5670) smoothly with minor FPS drops + Puzzles and avoiding confrontations  CON:  - the story is pretty generic, the endings are vague and rough-and-ready, which is a huge problem since this gives motivation to finish... yet, you get a Lovecraftish and underwhelming ending, without real twists and turns, either way you choose to finish - letting the threats being turned off impacts too much on the game experience to the negative side, makes it booooring - all the puzzles and going from one place to another because of some items throws you out quickly - everything else, that can throw you out: continuing after a while or a single disturbance from anyone/anything (e.g. Steam Chat)  Basically, if I have to compare to something, I would name Penumbra, Amnesia, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, but neither a direct one, more like a mixture of these. So would I recommend it? Yeah, it's worth a while to play, but don't expect much."
251370,Escape Goat,Very good puzzle-platforming game. The mechanics are solid and can be combined to create very interesting levels. Recommended!
251390,Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land,"If you are a fan of turn-based squad tacticals and Lovecraft, then this is an absolute no-brainer for the $5 price-tag.   I have no idea why this game has such mixed reviews. I played through the etire campaign and only ran into one bug that required a quick exit out and restart of the program. All I can figure it the game must have been patched since its release, or just don't know how to set their resolution.   All in all, Call of C'thul'hu: The Wasted Land is a delightfully fun little turn-based tactical squad game that has you leading your team of heavily armed investigators through the crater and poison-gas strewn hellscape of WW1 to stop a cult from using the fields of the dead to create their own army and literal hellscape.   The plot and gameplay refreshingly straightforward. Use XP and money earned every stage to upgrade your investigators and fight your way to the end and kill a big bad to death without losing too many redshirts along the way.  The challenge might seem a bit light to some, as I've never been able to beat X-Com but was able to beat this on normal while losing only a single redshirt along the way.   The campaign isn't very long, maybe 8-9 hours to beat, but it can be easily enjoyed in bite-size pieces (much like your investigators) and for $5 you're probably not going to do much better."
251410,Dark Matter,OK I'm not usually into platform genre games but this is one of the good ones 9/10 the only complaint is the graphics are a little tacky but you do get a good feel for the game and the game play is user friendly also for those who are new or inexperienced to this genre its easy to get into plus there's a tutorial in the beginning as-well.
251430,The Inner World,"This brought back the fun, interesting dialogue, characters and stories of old Point and Click adventure games and gave me a healthy dose of nostaliga and was a real joy to play. It's just a shame it's so damn short compared to the titles I remember from the older days.   Highlights"
251470,TowerFall Ascension,"TowerFall Ascension is a fun and approachable battle royale that makes excellent use of its deceptively simple retro looks and classic arcade platforming style. Every second is a mad scramble for ammo, powerups, and survival that, while sadly limited to local play only, kept my group of four players glued to their controllers with its highly competitive action. Even the single-player and co-op Quest mode is worth playing to practice your skills before going into battle."
251490,Gravity Ghost,I can't really sum up Gravity Ghost with words... It is a great Puzzle game and it has an amazing soundtrack made by Ben Prunty which some of you may be familiar with other titles such as FTL: Faster Then Light so you might want to pick up the soundtrack with this game! And to compliment the soundtrack is a lovely art style along with good gameplay.  I was pleasently surprised with this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend this game.
251510,Constant C,"Wow! This is an amazing puzzle platformer. Not as much of a brain breaker as something like Braid. But a very good game. Tight controls, great puzzles, and a surprisingly interesting little story too. Highly recommended!"
251530,Anomaly Korea,"A bit disappointing.. it's a step backward from the original Anomaly. OK, so it's a mobile 'port'.. but would it have been so difficult to implement the same controls as the original PC release? The navigaional map feels claustrophobic, and having to click 'n drag your way around seems silly.. as do activating the big clunky ability icons. Also gone is the commander from the original.. now it is only the vehicles under your control. Negatives aside, it is far from a complete disaster and still fun to play."
251570,7 Days to Die, Early Access Review
251630,The Impossible Game,"Really, really hard but fun and with a catchy soundtrack.  Has its fair share of bugs and glitches, however. Audio desync is a constant problem, as is 'jerky' motion. And sometimes the game just stops rendering anything at all and then crashes.  This was originally a positive review but I've had to change it to a negative one due to the extremely blatant and problematic jerkiness. For a game that's so about rhythm, it doesn't actually have one when it runs. It should be smooth but it's not."
251690,Speedball 2 HD,"I played this game on the Atari and loved it back in the day. When I saw this on Steam I wanted to get it. At first I didn´t like it as it wasn´t as good as I remembered it to be. But after a few hours I like it again. The controls are somewhat diffucult at first, especially the goal-keeper. But if you don´t get too exited you can control the players pretty good. I still try to keep the ball away from the goal-keeper though :-)  This is the kind of game you can start up and play for a few minutes and then turn it off again, for example play a single match in your season, or you can play several seasons in a row. It´s not an indepth manager game though you can transfer players, train them and do substitutions. This is more of a quick paced not to serious sports game focused on matchday.  "

251790,Steel Storm: A.M.M.O., Early Access Review
251830,Stick It To The Man!,"Not a very good adventure game. If you look for goofy humour, Psychonauts does it much better.  ✓ Decent soundtracks ✓ Interesting artstyle and rendering ✓ Dialogue fast forward feature to skip the stupidity  ✘ Poor humour and uninspired scripts ✘ Sub-par atmosphere (very static environments) ✘ Very basic game mechanics ✘ Brain-eating zombies (this is getting old now) ✘ Not a compelling story, boring characters ✘ Occasional sound glitches ✘ No Linux port despite the Unity engine! Shame!"
251850,Master Reboot,"A compelling story in a fun puzzle game with moments of pure running panic. Unfortunately gameplay is severely hampered by an inability to remap the input keys. I might be able to finish the final scene if I could use my mouse and sprint at the same time, but, as a leftie, that's not possible. I'm frustrated that something so simple makes this game impossible to finish.  I'd recommend it - if you're right handed."
251870,Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~,"This has some nice basic information for some (though more than a bit patronizing), but my gosh does it feel obnoxious and weeby, as well as not being worth the money if you didn't get it in a humble bundle centuries back. I don't miss the days when this was the only 'real' VN on steam, though I do like the use of the Japanese text above the English. Sadly - even with its weeb plot, royalty-free music stylings, and its plastic clothing - it still beats (heh) the Sakura series and its gripping (heh) plot. Was worth the trading cards for me though."
251890,World of Diving, Early Access Review
251910,Solar Flux,"Doesn't do it for me, and it's interesting how small the details that ruined it for me seem to be:  1: The star rating system. Passing the stage is never good enough. 'Remember always that you are mediocre,' says the game, as little chimes invariably sound towards the end of the run to signal your failure to pass the muster. The chime effect itself isn't grating at all, quite inobtrusive, but you know what it means. The sound of angels' voices could be just as easily poisoned if all angels had ever done for you was chide.  2: The ambience absolutely belies the character of the game, rather than adding to it. As mentioned above, this isn't *really* a relaxing experience. It's a tricky experience with a failure state. In order to excel at it you have to learn to ignore the ambience, rather than going along with it. That is a fairly objective case of failure of art.  3: There's a period right at the end of each level where you've succeeded, but your ship can still crash, and frequently does. This isn't terrible, it's true to the character of the game, that the life of the probe ceases to matter once its mission has been succeeded, the player should embrace that, but, still, experiencing something that would usually mean failure can confuse feeling of acheivement of completing the course. If I were the devs, I would either freeze time once the conditions of success had been met, or I'd provide some success stimulus significant enough to completely reframe a post-success crash."
251990,Long Live The Queen,"Fun and frustrating! You will die a lot, and everything is really cute. If you're into royal court hijinks, or feeling a Game of Thrones withdrawl or really into school schedules, get this game!"

252010,Oniken,This looks like a great game but it's completely broken on Mac. I'm assuming it's the same thing for Linux users as well. Hey devs! Please fix your game so us Mac guys can enjoy it.
252030,Valdis Story: Abyssal City,"I cannot say anything good about the game. It's good if you like arcade typegames like Metal Slug, only with swords, but since when has Metal Slug with swords worked properly? It actually LOOKS like that and achieves far less than Metal Slug does."
252050,Construction Machines 2014,Cons:   - Inexplicitly bad camera angles.  - inability to change screen resolution to fit the specifications of your current monitor resolution.  - Horendous controls accompanied by not so good explaination of said controls.  Pros:   - Musical masterpeice by unknown virtuoso.  - Graphics were scrum-diddly-umpshous.  If you wanted to work in construction your entire life buy it. #DreamBig  #TrashORBooty #TrashORTreasure

252290,Elegy For A Dead World,"This is not a game. It's a writing prompt and frankly, an author's nightmare!!! The vistas are beautiful but too sparse and the writer in me is just underwhelmed and uninspired. The price is really much much too steep for the lack of content. Basically, you are paying to kick start your own writing. You write the content; you pay to have nice scenery to help you write the content. I can get that any time of day by sitting in my room. Thanks but no thanks."
252310,Syder Arcade,"If you love R-Type and Katakis then you will love Syder Arcade. A colourful graphic, great music and awesome gameplay"
252330,Slender: The Arrival,"great game, played it a while back and... lets just say there was an accident. Its a good game for those who like nightmares, jumpscares and being tramatized for the rest of your life. 10/10"
252350,Double Dragon Neon,"Pros: amazing beat-em-up plenty of throwbacks a great sense of humor cons:  less moves than double dragon advance can only hold one special move at a time can be a bit grindy short those awful mullets are back. i prefer double dragon advances' designs for billy and jimmy.  advance is still the series standard. buut.... to say this game is double dragon 3 levels of bad or god forbid movie bad is a crime. this is a game worthy of the double dragon name. in spite of the cons, the game has too much fun factor and too much charm that i can overlook its faults. so what are you waiting for?!?! BUY IT."
252370,The Shivah,"I still enjoy this game to this day. It was the very interesting topic of a speech I gave within the 2014 PAXAus convention about the use of religious topics in video games. As a member of that audience it was such a shame to see it dominated by such staid minds. Referring to this 'story' certainly gave a much more diversified viewpoint. Again, I highly recommend giving this at least one play through."
252410,SteamWorld Dig,"I will describe this as a nice game. Not a good or a great one, a nice game to try out.  (Spoiler) In Steamworld Dig, you appear in a minimalist town. You\'re uncle/father(Can\'t even remember) was the digger of the settlement and now you come to meet him and learn he is dead. You will have to go deeper through the storyline to get more ores which will get you more money to buy better items to get ores faster and dig deeper.(Seem a bit simplistic, it is) The game is easy if you pay attention, if you just run without thinking, you might find it frustrating and die from easily escapable situation as I did.   I took my time and got through the game in 4.30 hours. It was fun, but there is no challenge or choice considering how you go through it.  The end was really unsatisfying to me. The end boss is easier then the earliest part of the game as you learned all the moves and this is all which is needed to beat the last boss, knowing how to move.  So for less then 5 hours, I paid more than 10$. The last game I played which such fast storyline and low replayability was South park Stick of Truth, it was 10x better. Not the same, but for a game you will play once, I will not recommend this game.  Early in the game, I was enthousiastic before realising it was only a game where you dig repeativily, fight monster very repeativily and get to an end which feel empty.  I had 2 hour of interest at most...  Still! I have to mention I liked the graphic design, but it can\'t make it for the lack of everything else."
252430,Dusty Revenge,"Don't buy it now. It's just one big, flamboyant glitch... Terrible fps, I don't have sound for some reason, graphics seem to break for people... Go in the community page for this game if you think I'm being a drama queen :V   I'll definately change this review once these extremely basic things get fixed.  It's unplayable due to the fps... Plus... Sound would be nice &gt;w&gt;;"
252450,StarDrive 2,"I want to love Stardrive 2.....  It has personality in spades and it is really immersive, more so than many/any other 4x game that I have.  However it frustrates the hell out of me to play it. The AI is super agressive from the get go so its usually a struggle for survival from the outset so there is not a lot of time for development (the 4x part), you end up having to follow one quite specific path to get through the beginning and its a military approach, many of the quests and missions are interesting but there are a limited number, you usually need to do them to survive the early game and this detracts from replayability.   However obvious limitations aside, there are glimpses of brilliance in Stardrive 2.  edit:-  I supported this and got all of the DLC.  The Sector Zero add on really made some improvements...  But the final ships DLC came out and for many broke the game (all races had different ships, but with this all are mixed up) and the Dev has not really been seen in the forums since and there have been no patches or anything.  Appears to have just walked away from a game again (like he did with Stardrive 1).  Sorry, wanted this game to be great but there are better options at this point...."

252550,Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube,"Atmospheric puzzle-adventure game with some lite Minecraft elements. Great soundtrack, tons of secrets, progressively more complex and challenging puzzles. Quick reflexes are a must on some levels.  Some reviewers have been complaining about having to restart levels entirely, but there are several checkpoints on each level, so not all progress is lost."
252570,Depths of Fear :: Knossos,"6/10  A solid, simple, and short horror piece that'd be an 8 with a little help (mostly with bugs).  You take the role of Theseus, with the goal of fighting your way out of the mythic labyrinth and slaying the minotaur. You start with nothing, but it's intended that you immediately find a torch in the enemy-free hub of the game. There's also a merchant there to help you out with weaponry, once you collect some dough from your explorations. The hub is a bit of a maze, but the sun shining down into the labyrinth will light up your entrance to the labyrinth.  Each tier of the labyrinth is run by a different fabled beast and is comprised of several randomly-generated levels that are all sorts of dark. The rules by which they're generated vary depending on which tier you're exploring, which is a nice touch, and the fabled beast will always be on the prowl. Many levels have minor beasties you'll have to contend with, and occasionally another boss beast (or several?) will be wandering around as well. Each level features a locked door for which you must find the key in order to move on. Up until the point that you can afford the more powerful weaponry, you're not much of a match for any of the major beasts, so running and hiding are your primary tools for advancing through the levels.  The audio is fantastic. Weird synth music kicks in when beasts notice your presence, and it does a great job of increasing the tension you were already feeling. Hiding behind a pillar or in a cabinet while you listen for the CLOMP, CLOMP of some hooves to recede is great. I love being creeped out by things that simple, and it only works when it's done right.  (minor spoilers below)  My complaints about the game are primarily that it just feels unfinished - as if it were fast-forwarded through the playtesting phase. There were several occasions where the terrifying beast I was avoiding was AI-ing itself in a corner somewhere, giving me free reign over the entire level. There were also occasional clipping issues that forced me to restart levels. The battleaxe seems overpowered, as the double-swipe basically allowed me to cheese my way through any beast in the labyrinth, short of the minotaur himself. And the minotaur...was a huge disappointment. Visually, it was wonderful - especially the trippy red beams. But he couldn't hit me. I didn't notice this for a while since I was just fleeing maniacally whenever he spotted me, but I eventually confirmed that the dude just missed me every single time. Turns out if an enemy can't hurt you, it decimates any fear you might have felt. So that sucks."
252630,Eldritch,"I tried to get a creepy atmosphere, tried to overlook the minecraft Graphics and say its not about the Graphics. But it is. The game is no Fun at all.

This is the first game made by Jackbox Games (formely Jellyvision), and it's packed with good trivia and great comedy. Before you get anxious to try this out with the kids and grandma, you should be aware that the humor is quite risqué. Granted, it's a witty humor, but those of a more pristine character should think twice before purchasing this. For everyone else, this is a solid investment even if you're not a trivia buff. The humor alone is worth it."

253110,The Cat Lady,"If you just want to marinate in a thickly depressing story with an artsy vibe and shock factor, this is probably what you're looking for. But it's not much of a game. It's an interactive story with very light 'puzzles' and the illusion of choice. And be prepared to wait through LOTS of angsty dialogue that you can't escape in the middle of. I like dark and thoughtful stories but not just for the sake of depressing you. This just wasn't that much fun to play."
253150,Halfway,"After playing a little longer, I realized this game is stupidly random and I have to change my review ... the RNG is terrible! I keep missing so much in situations where it really is not expected. The encounters are shallow, the item pickups are very scarse and the game is too difficult."
253250,Stonehearth, Early Access Review
253290,FOTONICA,"This has an interesting visual style, but the game play is simple, and yet imprecise. I've found that when I try to jump, it sometimes doesn't. This is a game with one control, and that control is sometimes finicky...  If you can pick this up on the cheap, like through Humble Bundle, it could be an interesting diversion, but there just isn't enough substance to really justify the large price tag on this game."
253330,Neverending Nightmares,Psychological horror indie game which is scary... good... very good... I kinda like it... yea...  8/10
253350,Tiny Barbarian DX,i love this game . love the soundtrack. every stage segment has its own track. some hidden cokies that dont give u anything but are fun to discover . to bad it takes so ong for the remaining episodes to come out ... but keep in mind that its one guy who makes this game on his sparetime. two thumbs up. retro goodness!!!!

253410,Ravensword: Shadowlands,"Pretty bad RPG. It's a mobile port and feels like it. Game looks about equal to morrowind, which game out in 2001. Towns have 1 guard on streets and 1 person in each building. Even in a tavern where you would normally see people and get quests, there's only 1 single person whos the owner at the bar. Each character has like 1 line of spoken dialogue and the rest you must read. Each area on map is the same boring open area with 2 different enemy types, usually animals or something generic like skeletons. Storyline is super boring and run of the mill. There are hilarious things, like how passageways to new areas and caves, are presented as empty rooms with no exit on the other side, which is just lazt programming. There a random spikes in difficulty, like having to fight multiple trolls at once that stun and can kill you in 3 hits. In these cases you never know if you need to grind higher levels or need to get better gear. The leveling system is bad. You gain levels, attributes, talents, and then you also get skills in things by utilizing them more, like bow weaponry, but it continues to have a higher ceiling as you level, and you keep reaching it. But it's never explained what exactly being 45/45 means for damage, etc. especially bc you also have talents and attributes that boost it. Everything you need to buy costs way too much, even simple potions. There is really no magic at all. It's just a bad rpg, although not broken.   5.5/10."
253430,CastleMiner Z,"It's an okay game, it brings back memories from Xbox 360. The only problem is that sound cannot be turned off."
253510,Warmachine Tactics,"Still an early access game, purchase at your own risk. The basics are good, the AI and UI need work, but otherwise shaping up to be really good.  UPDATE: lmao they didn't fix the UI at all. I can't believe they released it in this state."
253570,Gentlemen!,"A great game, BUT you need more than one player to play. And I suppose the game does eventually get repetitive, but if you want local multiplayer, this is pretty good"
253610,Wrack,"It's an alright game, but not interesting for very long. It's got a Quake/Doom vibe to it, but doesn't really keep you entertained.  It's fun, but not for long enough. The later campaign levels start to feel more chore-like in design.  Though the soundtrack is pretty good! It's by Bobby Prince, who did the Doom soundtrack as well. (Bobby Prince actually needs our help!  https://www.gofundme.com/bobby-prince-medical-fund-2vs94pg  )  The visual style is also really neat. The animations look good, the weapon designs are cool, and the overall art direction is pretty fascinating.  But if you're looking for gameplay, this may not keep your attention."
253630,Steam Marines,"Not what i except.  Want a Squadbased Game with Rpg elements and Story. Sure thats all in the game, but it feel more like a free Handy Game then a real PC game.  -&gt; refound"
253650,Sparkle 2 Evo,"This game cost 50 cents, so I boutgh, thinking that it would be fun and relaxing like flow. Big mistake. In this game, you play as weird cell creature in the ocean (like Flow), but they made you collect EVERY LITTLE THING in WHOLE LEVEL! And you gained an extra cell bit for your tail (like Flow). If you want a godd game, cu buy flow, it's worth it, trust me."
253670,Aartform Curvy 3D 3.0,"This program acts like a third-party first-generation 3-D modeling program that has a lot of the same features that you would find in a promotional software giveaway, I would not recommend this to anyone for any reason. It is simply a waste of money. There are quite a few older modeling programs that have a more friendly interface and tutorials of those who do not yet understand the basics to modeling and design.  I cannot endorse or condone anyone buying this product."

With only 2 levels of difficulty plus a zen level, boredom set in after 3 hours. Would have to play longer to gain the achievements though.   The artwork is simple and plain, but visually balanced, gameplay is simplistic and somewhat fun for awhile, then it all just becomes a sameness.  "
253860,Earth 2140 HD,"Earth 2140 is old lesser-known Real-Time Strategy that was released in 1997, with Command And Conquer-like approach to design, not unlike many other RTS back then. Released only on computers, original version was DOS version. It was later ported to Windows, with a huge flaw: AI wasn't working properly.  So, what Steam version has going for it? Steam version lets you select if you want to play Windows version of 'HD' version. Main differences are quite simple, HD works more reliably on modern systems. Intro movie was changed as well, scenes mixed around. Multiplayer isn't available in both, you have to search for DOS version for that. It also already comes with 2 mission pack, with 14 missions in total. Got to say, intro movie in the first mission pack is cool. And supposedly, HD version fixes WIndows AI bug. Yet it doesn't, thus you still have a screwed up game.  Plot is quite simple. It's that you don't understand anything in intro movie, but it's cool, for it has androids and terminators. Ok, more exactly, it has United Civilized States, which is nation where robots do absolutely everything and people turned into complete 'pigs', and it has Eurasian Dynasty, which is more of dictatorship using outdated technology of tanks and such. And all of them fighting to take over Earth surface for recources. Pretty much both sides are 'evil' in their way, which is quite unique. And that's pretty much what you will get, just war, with no real story between missions.  And yes, mission objectives are quiet varied, even though majority of them is 'build base, destroy enemy base'. It got you destroying all enemies in map without your own base, finding lost machine, capturing bases, or even has you in the center of the map, with limited recources and surrounded by enemy, making you go offensive immeditly. Also, no skirmish, campaign only. But once you get to more classic 'destroy enemy base' mission, that is majority, the AI problems will surfrace.  Earth 2140 playes like a C&amp;C era game, having you press left mouse button to order units and having building/command/menu commands bar on the side of screen. And a very clunky one at that, controlling with only mouse is quite a chore, better learn some hotkeys. There is no good tutorial, so thsi game will require effort to get into. And yes, it got power plants, it got resources, which you can by building mines (and refinery and then have trucks move boxes around) over the yellow-painted parts of grounds, that you can see only on minimap (or when placing mine)... Jolly. Another unique thing is how research is done. You just build research center and it gets done qutomatically. Can't say that it's a good idea.  Both factions get to have their own units, which are kinda different, in looks and a bit in stats, but otherwise fill same niches. There are 4 types of units: soldiers, who are good at dieing in numbers and capturing buildings, venichles/mechs that are the main part of army, water units and air units, which zip around fast. All of them have various weapons, rockets, napalm bombs, laser... though laser ones are the best. But they all seem to be balanced stat-wise. Or not exactly balanced, it's hard to tell. There are no strategy guides and nothing in the game explains what is best for what situation. That, and it may turn out that best tactic is to spam most effective units anyway, seeing game's age.  And so comes main flaw with AI in this version, that ruins most of mission into dumb unfun session. He can't go offensive. He will not build new structures. He will repair though. He can't go offensive. He will only attack you once, as if scripted, if you discover him out, but once you do, he will remain defensive. And most importantly, he will produce a huge army for defence without stop, from what I gathered. And that isn't exactly fun, as you have to try to build a bigger army before AI does. Otherwise it will be a continuous attempt to kamikaze your way into, wall onto wall. I will be honest, I didn't figure out how to beat some of these missions.  Earth 2140 even had an unique feature that was dependant on AI: Virtual Generals. You could select a bunch of units and then put them under 'General''s control, making them scout or even attack through the map without you paying attention. I doubt that it had much of use, but in Steam version it doesn't even work at all.   Graphics and setting are quite nice for it's time, nothing fancy though. Music on other hand is worth mentioning. It doesn't exactly fit the game. Tracks are nice, but they don't blend in. It got one or more jokish peaceful or jazzy tracks in it, with bird singing. Nice idea, but hearing it among one of few tracks in a game feels quite weird.  I can't really say if original DOS version was bad or not, quite possibly I didn't understand this RTS yet, I didn't manage to beat whole campaign after all. And I did have fun here and there, on small maps at least. But what I can say is that it's unfriendly and Steam version's AI refuses to give a fun kind of challenge. If you want to get familiar with this title, you should find it somewhere else, aiming for DOS version."
253880,Earth 2150 Trilogy,This Game is Horrible...it took me and my dad an hour to get into the game.The graphics are L.A.M.E and theres no freakin instructions of how to play. Also you cant repair your buildings and bases. I would rate this game 0/10 (H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E)
253900,Knights and Merchants,"So after playing a couple of hours it is time to put down some thoughts about this game.   The main reason i purchased this game on Steam is for nostalgia reasons as i played K &amp; M back in the 'good' old days.  Right from the start i unfortunately have to say that i do not recommend this games except maybe for nostalgia reasons.   Here`s why:  In a nutshell the games does not hold up to modern standards or even the standards of other economy-focussed strategy games (Anno series or the settlers IV to name examples).   Singleplayer: The game comes packaged with a campaign about a kingdom in peril which the player has to save. The story is decently told and the missions are relatively varied in terms of startup, objectives and focus changes between battles and town building. My main issues concern the gameplay itself. Some of these issues do play a role in multiplayer as well.  First of all every time a player starts a SP or MP match from scratch and has to build a town he is only allowed to build 1 building in the beginning. As soon as that building is finished another building is unlocked, followed by another upon completion. In itself i don`t mind a progression system however this design decision leads to immediate boredom as it takes several minutes to construct the first building and the player can do nothing but watch. There is nothing else to do.... only after the 3rd building is constructed several more are unlocked and the game actually starts.  My next issue concerns the actual construction of the buildings. All buildings require a road connection so building material can be brought to the site as well as the transportation of goods etc. after the building is constructed. In theory this is a good idea. However there is now way to prioritize buildings so the player is forced to wait for the more important building to be finished before ordering the next one. This problem is worsened by the fact that the Laborers (may also be referred to as builders) always prioritize roads. So if you have a finished road and all materials present at a building site but are constructing a road on the other side of the town your laborers will first move to the other side to finish the road. Again this means that the player is forced to wait as prioritizing buildings is impossible.   Furthermore your town is unprotected untill the barracks are constructed and recruits have been trained. Again this is not too bad. However if your opponent is quicker and attacks with even 1 soldier there is nothing you can do as he can basically prevent you from building a barracks by killing off the builders. There is no way your people are going to be fast enough once you spot the enemy soldier. Regarding the defensibility i prefer the way Settlers IV handled it. That games used a tower system which made the defender a bit stronger than the attacker. That way it is impossible to be overrun by one unit.   The last issue i can think of is that players cannot prioritize which material or goods should be transported first.   Multiplayer: K &amp; M on steam is playable in two modes: HD and 'normal'. The HD mode does not support multiplayer hence this section will refer to the standard version.  The multiplayer has a variety of maps as well as two modes (Battle or build a town) in which the objective is to defeat the enemy by destroying their town and/or troops and is playable by up to 6 players.  However the multiplayer is close to being unplayable as it is prone to desynchronisation. Up till now every multiplayer match i played desynced and even worse the game doesn`t notify the players when the match is desynchronised. This leads to much time being wasted as players are unable to see or interact with the soldiers of the other player.   In summary: A lack of control, initial boredom when starting a match some poor design decisions, vulnerability and multiplayer desynchronisation issues are the reasons why i cannot recommend this game."
253920,Gorky 17,"Love this game! Used to play it a few years back, and i recently found it here on steam, cheap as hell, and i was surprised at how good it still plays! def. recomend it for someone who enjoys a good tactical RPG with a good story, with lots of twists and interesting characters (You never know who might end up joining -or leaving- your squad). All-in-all an' 'oldie but goody' game, and well worth its small price!"
253940,Septerra Core,Simply one of the best games I played back in '99. Definitely worth every cent!
253960,Jack Orlando Director's Cut,"Greatest game of my life! The story line touches my soul. The graphics cant be beat! This game somewhat consumed my life, as I couldnt play anything else. Get it as soon as you can!"

254080,World War III: Black Gold,how do you play this?
254100,World War II: Panzer Claws,POS doesn't work! I want my 99 cents back!
254200,FortressCraft Evolved,Great Game! Love all of the automation there is for mining. Definitely worth the buy!
254320,Duskers,"This game is ridiculous. When you are on a mission, you HAVE TO complete it, otherwise if you quit, you not only lose all the progresses on that mission but also, ridiculously, CANNOT return to the mission as the game says that you have already explored the ship and can't reexpolore it... How does that even make sense? Why on earth can't I return to the ship on which I have already landed? Fix this problem or give explanation to it or I won't touch this game any more.  By the way, if you hate permadeath, don't buy this game; it doesn't have save and reload options to rewind any mistakes you make unless you restart from the very beginning."
254440,Pool Nation,"I enjoyed playing this game, recently it stopped working ....completely, I deleted local files and redownloaded the game and it still won't start up, pretty sad at this as it was not as good as Virtual Pool Hall but was a decent substitute until VPH is available again"
254460,Obscure,"I hope you guys wanting this badly have played it before, because for those of you who haven't, let me tell ya my 'fun' experience.    Oh wait, there was no fun in my experience.    First, NO MANUAL.    You're thrown into a game, with no manual to give you a heads up as to what is going on, there is a movie scene, and it just... stops. And your character is standing there, waiting for instructions from you. Yeah, that same you that doesn't have a clue about what is going on because there is no manual.    Turns out your supposed to get him to move. Great, I finally figure out how to get him to move. So he's walking around in circles. No popups telling you what buttons to mash or where to go, you just walk around in endless circles bumping into the door because hey, why not figure if you walk into the door you walk through it. With all the info you have to go on, that seems as good an idea as any.    Only he just walks into the door. Finally after 10 minutes of walking around and cussing, I happened to mash the A button on my controller while he was standing close to the basketball. ALL RIGHT!! That did something. A cut scene, where he shoots a foul shot, the ball lands on the floor, and.... back to square one. I figured maybe he had to make 3, or 5 or something foul shots in a row and that would 'start something'. Nope, after about 8 or 10, I stopped trying. Again, nothing popping up on the screen to help you and no manual.    So I walk over to one of the doors and mash the A button again and another cut scene, he opens the door, enters another room and a phone is ringing. I walk over to the phone, mash the A button, and another cut scene talking to his girlfriend. Great, I think, something is starting to happen.    Two door later, five miles of walking around later, and finally a couple of popups that finally helped a little later, I'm in this long corridor, with a flashlight taped to a gun, and something that you can't really make out (it just looks like black fog on my screen) is blocking your way and a popup comes up and says to shoot it. And which button to hold to aim. (Finally at least SOME help).    So I shoot the 'thing'. Six times. No more bullets. No help on how to reload, no help on whether you need extra ammo or if you just need to reload. Thinking I needed extra ammo, I spent another hour covering every inch of that long corrider and the room above where the gun was found in the first place and found no ammo, and pressed all the buttons on my controller trying to reload and after that hour, my last one, I wrote this.    For those of you who haven't played this, you've been fairly warned."
254480,Obscure 2,"Obscure 2 is a dissapointing sequel to Obscure. While it still eschews teen horror clichés and quite a bit of intentional cheesiness and campiness, the game for some reason includes monster ♥♥♥♥, monster pregnancy and suicide which are very jarring to the overall tone of the game. The gameplay is fun if unpolished and the combat system is even clunkier than O1.  If you long for a late 2000s low budget survival horror, you could pick much worse."
254590,Theme Park Studio, Early Access Review
254700,Resident Evil 4,"Until crashes are fixed. Do not purchase this game. I played for atleast 3 hours trying to different avenues, reinstalling the game, turning off anti virus, lowering graphics, different patches, etc etc. It still does not work. I'm running off windows 10. Seemed like a great game, but not if it keeps crashing and I can't even get out of the first town."
254820,Ground Control Anthology,"Good old Ground Control, thanks to Steam I was able to play one of my most favourite RTS Games again. I played this Game alot when I was way younger and didn't have any acces to the Internet. Got it from a Magazine that bundled multiple Games on one CD.  The games pretty old now, outdated graphics, but alas a classic and I'd recommend it to anyone who like's RTS games.  Since it's the Anthology Version, I got to play Dark Conspiracy aswell, since that wasn't part of the Game I played way back. I was looking forward to the campaign.  The Cutscene's are definetly better made then in the original campaign. After finishing the campaign. It felt like some missions, of Dark Conspiracy, were more like a chore than a challenge, some of them just seemed drawn out and I don't know if it's just me but I think there were way more enemies per mission than in the original campaign. It felt a bit like, Quantity over Quality. In the original campaign some enemies were well placed and could catch you off guard. In Dark Conspiracy it just seemed like they were all piled up on one point in some missions.They were still fun, but I enjoyed the original missions much more. The new faction they introduced didn't really impress me that much, 1 or 2 units were pretty cool like The Swarm Aerodyne, but that's pretty much it.  I'd still recommend the base game and if you really enjoyed the Gameplay and want more. Go ahead and try out Dark Conspiracy. Or try playing the Multiplayer, there's not alot of people, but a dedicated group of players who play on GameRanger. I've only ever played the Multiplayer in the 2nd one, but it was alot of fun.  tl;dr Definetly give it a try if you like RTS Games "
254840,Ground Control II,Still one of the best sci-fi RTS ever made.  P.S. Just like HL we are waiting for 3rd part.
254860,Lords of the Realm III,"Bought 5 copies, gave them to my friends. I don't have friends anymore."
254880,MoonBase Commander,"Been playing this game back when xp was still huge, and its still as fun as I remembered."
254920,Lords of the Realm,This game is terrible.
254960,Silent Storm,"(Note: Game time does not count offline play) ...said that...  Wow! It seems to help reading the reviews... otherwise I wouldn't have considered buying this game...  If you like games like X-Com, Silent Storm Improves almost every aspect of the formula.  It's not Sci-Fi, that's obvious... but when missions can take Hours of careful tactical choices.... That's just Great Gameplay!  If you like Turn-based Games this Gem from 2003 won't disappoint you ;)"
25500,Cricket Revolution,Is there no way to add a control. using keypad is terrible
255070,Abyss Odyssey,"It has a cool Artstyle and can be fun at start but it gets boring very fast. Sure you can do nice combos with a bit of practice, but why if you can beat the game simply buttonmashing ? There are about 4 different kind of stages and maybe a dozen different enemys.  After you beat the game (took me about 4 hours) the only thing you can do is unlock new charakters and try to beat the final boss again... Sorry not enough variety for me"
255260,Pro Cycling Manager 2014,"I love this game. This is the first game I have bought in the series of games. Although there are a couple of glitches and crashes, the game itself I good. If you save often, you the crashes aren't much of a problem. Some visual aspects could be improved but I like this game and play it all the time. I mean just look at my play time."
255280,1954 Alcatraz,   This game is not worth $20
255300,Journey of a Roach,"Adventure game in a quirky setting with no dialogue. The setting and world is likeable even though the music is annoying the hell out of me after the first 2 minutes.  Puzzles are almost always trial and error, this is the true death sentence for any adventure game. Try to combine all inventory items with each other and then with every object you encounter... so frustrating. Also the controls are nothing but annoying.   Additionally, I played through the whole thing in about 2 hours, so vastly overpriced at 7.5 Euro per hour.  Not recommended, even for adventure fans. There are million better point and click adventures out there."

255370,KickBeat Steam Edition,"The notes doesn't feel quite right, they don't really match up with the music. It's like they couldn't decide on which beats to put the notes and therefore sprinkled them a bit here and there making the controls feel rather loose."
255390,Max: The Curse of Brotherhood,"Loved this game! The animation was really beautiful and I enjoyed all of the different levels/worlds. I thought the puzzles were fun and they allowed you to be creative in your solutions. DON'T BE AFRAID OF THIS GAME BECAUSE OF THE 'MAGIC MARKER'. It's very simple to use (especially with a controller) and you get used to it quickly. If I had to compare Max to other games, I would say that it's a well-executed mix Ori and the Blind Forest and (a refined version of) Nihilumbra."
255520,Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior,It is good for a joke but for a game there is nothing much to do.
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Negative 10 million is my score for this worthless piece of trash. It is a black screen with sound effects. It has been this way since launch. There is no working fix, the company is NON-responsive to people having this exact issue. You got my twenty bucks, and not so much as a reach-around. Thanks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."
255870,PixelJunk™ Shooter,"Graphics and Style are great. However the game mechanic began to bore me fairly quickly. Was disappointed when trying to play the game with a friend: Somehow it doesn't support game controllers. And who these days, plays on two keyboards?"
255920,The 7th Guest,"It is a fun little puzzle game, and an impressive achievement when originally released in 1992. Thanks to the game's integrated filmed scenes. Made possible by the CD-Rom format that was gaining in popularity. The game starts off by introducing the other 6 guests, you are the titular 7th, at Stauf's mansion. After the cinematic scene, you are free to roam the mansion with the objective to find and solve the games myriad of 20 some puzzles. The puzzles are riffs from some of the ones you find in toy stores that feature board games. The better puzzles are the ones that do not have a singular solution, but a defined strategy to solve. There are plenty of better puzzle games, look no further than Portal or The Witness. But, The 7th Guest remains creepy thanks to a memorable main score and art direction. For anyone that wants to take a trip down memory lane, or jonesing for a quick jaunt through some puzzles, The 7th Guest proves to be well worth the visit."
255940,The 11th Hour,"The 11th Hour is the not-so-well recieved sequel to the beloved classic point &amp; click adventure game, The 7th Guest. It was Trilobyte's attempt to ride upon the coat-tails of its initial success with their first runaway hit and in many ways was a hit-and-miss title.  The story picks up 60 years after the events of the first game, 60 years later! So, it's only real returning cast member is Henry Stauf. Besides Stauf himself and the iconic Stauf Mansion (which was poorly represented in the FMV), The 11th Hour really has nothing to do with the events of the first game at all. It's a shame really, just think: a story focusing on the original protagonist coping as an adult years after his traumatizing experiences only to confront Stauf once again - it would have made for a better sequel concept. Despite this, the game's story and setting isn't all that bad... but it isn't amazing either.  On a technical level, Trilobyte improved upon its FMV process but the cheesy acting ends up undercuting that fact. The game also ran on a later version of the 'Groovie' engine than its predecessor, but when The 11th Hour was released the engine was considered to be outdated compared to many point &amp; click engines of the time. It didn't help that for many the engine didn't play nice on most hardware configurations of the time. It frequently crashed and for some it wouldn't even make it past the first menu screen due to differences in CD-ROM drive reading speeds. It prevented most (including myself) from being able to experience the game when it first came out.  Despite these short-comings, there is much to appreciate about the game. The soundtrack is amazing, the 3D rendered graphics and animations were further improved upon, the quality in FMV production improved, the puzzles were equally as challenging as the first game, the story was enough to keep you invested, and all of this lent itself well to a 90s nostalgia inducing atmosphere similar to The 7th Guest yet unique in it's own way.  Had this game been advertised as an independent experience and had it ironed out the technical compatiblity issues, I believe it would have fared better for it's time. I can only recommend this game if you enjoyed The 7th Guest, have a love for cheesy 90s nostalgia, and have a good sense of open-mindedness and a humor-me attitude. You'll enjoy and appreciate the game better if you have all that coming into it.  So... 'Let's take the time to find ourselves again, away from daily stress and pain, though we may find we'll not come back the same, that happens sometimes when we play, the Game.'"

25600,Eschalon: Book 1,"The first time I played this game was when I was a little kid, It's cheap, yet fun. If you play your cards right, you will get about 15-20 hours out of this adventure of a game, I left very helpful hints in the discussions and hope that if you buy the game, it will be really helpful!  I rate this game an 8/10. Boring for the first 3-4 hours if you aren't into being a weak character and slowly building into a badass! push past those first couple hours and you will find this game, and the rest of the games in the trilogy to be fun, so buy the game and have fun. Also keep in mind the bundle is only $20!"
256010,Jagged Alliance Flashback,This game should have been removed from steam after the company no long exists.  It is also a shame that the Bearpit hyped up this game to loyal JA supports during Early Access.  To many bugs and lacking features that made JA fun.

256290,Child of Light,"- I click 'Play'. - Uplay boots up ('Oh god no. Why don't those games come with a warning label?') - Steam was apparently not allowed to patch the game. A Uplay patcher starts up. - Uplay patcher is stuck at 0 for several minutes. It fails to download a single byte. - I shut it down and try to start the game again. - Steam can't launch the game - the Uplay processes are still blocking it. - I try to restart Steam. - The processes are blocking Steam from shutting down. - I restart the computer.  - I boot up Steam, click play and get the Uplay patcher again. - 30 idle seconds pass... Yay, the patcher starts downloading! - The download stops and progress resets to 0. - Download starts where it left off, then resets 0 speed and progress again. Starts. Stops. Starts. Stops... - Patch finishes downloading, in only twice the time it took Steam to download the entire game. - I have to log into Uplay to play the game. At least I'm already registered. - Uplay user agreement changed. They inform me that I have to accept their changes or my account and its game collection will be deleted. - Uplay asks me whether I want to permanently link it with Steam, making it boot up every time I start Steam. I decline. - Uplay demands the CD-key that was shown to me 20 minutes ago when I first clicked play and chose never to show it again. I dig up the CD-key and input it. - I click play. - The game spends 20 seconds booting up Uplay and making sure it can find a connection to Ubisoft servers before allowing the Steam game to start as normal. (this repeats every time I have to boot up the game) - I am now able to play the game.  Pros: - Game seems nice. I *want* to support the developers.  Cons: - Pretty sure I would have gotten a better product if I had not chosen to go the legal way. - Took 20 minutes of effort to start, after the game was already fully installed in Steam. - I have no clue what will happen if Uplay disconnects. Past experience tells me it's likely to shut down my game without saving and that I will be unable to continue playing until the servers start working again."

Otherwise it is a bug-fest - it doesn't save your control settings, most of the time you cannot exit the game properly, sometimes it crashes. No Casey Stoner among legends. As for simulator I would recommend to add the possibility to jump starts, overdo wheeling, get hurt at crashes thus missing some races in a championship..."
256440,Monsters & Munitions,"Enormous waste of potential.   This had the possibility of being a good game. It had good art, a neat concept, and lots of weapon variety. Then it was abandoned by the developer(s), who no longer seem to exist as their web domain is for sale.  If I treat Monsters &amp; Munitions as another good example of why we should always be wary of Early Access titles, then at least it still has value as a warning.  "

257050,Darkout,"There was some fun and the game was pretty, but I wasn't terribly pleased with the controls and the behavior of certain objects like elevators. Once I got everything I could researched and pretty much explored everywhere, I waited for the rest of the game to be finished.... It won't be, from what I hear. If you get it cheaper than Terraria it might give you a few hours or so of fun and exploration. But my ultimate recommendation: Get Terraria (or another time-tested sandbox game.)"
257120,Not The Robots,Bland game with a boring gimmick whose life is artificially lengthened by buzzword du jour 'procedurally generated' nonsense.
257170,Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville,"I didn't think I was going to like this after the first few minutes in the game - it has a huge mobile app feel. But once I got past that, I noticed the nice interface, the charming graphic art, the interesting story, the strategic choices, and the overall addicting and fun gameplay.   I'm very glad I purchased this little gem! It may not provide tons and tons of hours since I can see it getting old eventually but for now I'm loving it and having a blast in the story mode.  This is a great buy if you need a temporary zombie survival game to get you through the week. It offers a ton of fun choices and fun gameplay."

257260,Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb,"I really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't. I love old adventure games and went in knowing that it's not going to be a Lucasarts classic, but still hoping for a good time. Nope. It's full of terrible cliches, bad writing, bad voice acting, and of the 6 hours it took me to complete the game, probably around 5 of those were spent in mazes. I feel like all those mazes were a cop-out for putting actual content in the game (there was very little of that). They added nothing but sheer frustration to the gameplay experience. Plus, some of the areas you have to revisit several times which means you have to navigate those mazes EVERY TIME. What a waste of time and energy. I ended up using a walkthrough just to slog through it. Inherit The Earth, you've really disappointed me."
257350,Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition,A timeless classic that never ages. It makes modern RPGs look try-hard in comparison.  Easy to learn yet deep and complex battle mechanics paired with in-depth character management make for a wonderful experience in the Forgotten Realms. Rich and detailed characters develop through the wonderfully crafted storyline that stands the test of time. It marries video games to D&amp;D mechanics better than any game before and after it's release.  Baldur's Gate (and the original) should be in every CRPG fans library.
257400,Fuse,"Good product that is constantly evolving adding new features.  So be careful because reviews from the early versions aren't accurate anymore.  EDIT: Had to change my review... after Adobe bought Fuse... not only this product is dead, but the new product is used only for phososhop, not for games... so another wasted product (and money) ... 10x Mixamo, 10x Adobe... I'll remember that!"
257510,The Talos Principle,"TL;DR: I recommend this game wholeheartedly to fans of puzzle games, philosophy, ambience and intriguing narratives.  I first want to say that this is my first review. I feel compelled to write it in order to recommend this great game to others. Playing this game gave me the rare experience of being pulled in completely by the mystery and ambience and alluring narrative of a game to such a degree that I had a hard time breaking away from the game until I had completed it.  I think, the plot of the game should be spoiled as little as possible for newcomers, so my advice is: dive in, dive down the rabbit hole, and be amazed! In short, it is a puzzle game with a great story, a very well paced narrative, great music, beautiful scenery, great writing, great voice-acting, and realistic feeling reactivity to choices (yes). The game is long, but the puzzles and level design are creative enough for it not to get boring. And although the game is long, it is not too long. This game sets a standard for atmosphere and intelligent writing that I hope other games will try to meet.  Some things that could be held against the game: some puzzles were hard - some were very easy. But easy puzzles doesn't bother me in a game where every couple of solved puzzles advance the narrative. And some of the scenery can get a bit repetetive - although this kind of fits with the narrative, and anyway, the creative level design keeps it interesting throughout. And maybe it should be made clear that although the game is played in first person 3d, it is not a shooter or any kind of action game (although time constraints factor in at places), but a puzzle game. So if that is not your thing at all, and if you wouldn't consider playing a puzzle in spite of a great story and great writing, this probably won't be your thing. But I think it would be a thing for many.  As I said, my advice is to dive in. And only take to the internet and guides and walkthroughs for completionism and secrets after you have experienced most of the game first-hand.  To give you some insight into my perspective, I am a jaded former student of philosophy and an at times disillusioned gamer. This game kind of rekindled my interest in some philosophical subjects as well as my hope for narrative in games."

257630,Blast Em!,"As the game stands, I would not recommend it.   Even for the achievement hunters out there, it is tedious to try to gain all of these.  My suggestions:  Stop making the game about 'how difficult it is' and the '34 second life expectancy', because as it stands, the games fun lasts for about 34 seconds.  Upgrades: 2 ways to do this. 1. Use the coins at the end to buy upgrades which last 1 round. 2. Upgrade the ship each time you achieve a new rank, gaining an extra life and better weapons.  Make enemies a little more exciting, it feels like i'm playing space invaders on LSD.  Bosses? Perhaps there are some... but I haven't seen any.  Different backgrounds to mix it up a bit.  Different ship skins which can be unlocked.  Quests? An option that will take a bit more work, but having quests usually makes a game a little more interesting.  As it stands, it is pretty mindless."

257670,Elder Sign: Omens,"You like COC? You believe Skill, Strong Will, Smart Thinking and Courage is what you need to face the Great Old One?  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is nothing but a dice tossing game with COC jacket, all you need is not careful planning, sharp eye to pick up clues, willing to risk your SP for deeper look into the mytho... But just pure LUCK! Ya! Luck is all you need, because no matter what you do, the only thing that affect your so call 'adventure' are nothing but blind luck that allow you to shack up the right combination of Glyphs to match the requirement to clear a 'Tiny Picture of Something Related to CoC'... and that is all the Adventure you ever going to get in this game at all!  And how to lose the game? You are RIGHT! You lose the game by simply being NOT LUCKY ENOUGH!! You run out of chance and can't shack up the right combination of Glyphs? TOO BAD! The Old One +1 and you lose SP for that... not because some dark horror lurking in the shadow, but just because you forgot to bring your lucky dice!  So in this great game, all you need to do to serve Cthu-Boss on a plate is simple, just show him your lucky dice and he will ROLL OVER AND DIE!! YAY! That is GREAT!! We no longer need to go through dark woods or horror tunnel, we no longer need to search haunted house and deathly crypt, no knowledge needed, no weapon needed, you don't even need to bring your cat to try to scare off those fish-head, you just need PALE LUCK!  If you are a COC fan, or who had read H.P.Lovecraft's book... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!! This is for kids under 3!!    Okie... I have to point out... The music and art style of this game is still fairly nice tho... But sadly..."
257690,J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars,"I wanted to like this game, I really did. I'm usually a fan of point-and-click adventures, especially ones with cool contraptions and/or technology. Unfortunately, this particular point-and-click game just wasn't worth it. The voice acting was distractingly bad, the story was cliche at best, and the game's progression ended up being little more than boring. While the art was fairly good and some of the puzzles were interesting -- I liked the idea of making a detective-esque, figure-out-what-happened sort of puzzle -- they weren't enough to redeem the game."
257710,Max Gentlemen,"Max Gentleman is a game about stacking as many hats as possible on your character's head. It has two different single player modes, Challenge and Score Attack. Simplistic in design and mechanics yet still retains an element of fun. A charming little time waster that I'm sure to play more of in the future.  Art: 6/10 Characterization: 1/10 Concept: 4/10 Enjoyment: 7/10 Humour: 6/10 Music: 4/10 Originality: 5/10 Plot: 0/10 Replay Value: 6/10 Overall: 5/10 Would Recommend To: Anyone who likes hats or arcade style games"
257730,Infinity Wars - Animated Trading Card Game,I can not let this go on. i use to long this game alot. due to the fact the game is so buggy wasnt enough to slow me down. i was still in fiend mode you can see by my hours. but now its no balance in the game. bugs have grew to bugs freaking bunny. and the community dont share deck ideas nothing at all really. there is no fan base hardly anymore. its just a dud when you have to wait and wait for game to be played. its really sad what a waste of an collection.
257750,Bloody Trapland,This game will drive you and your friends insane!
257770,Signal Ops,"Interesting concept, game could be a lot of fun if not for the awful controls. Some people may not be bothered by that but for me it made the game too annoying to keep playing."
257790,Riptide GP2,"my 2 grand kids love an i do too,very cool game graphics are awesome an plays pefectly on my pc...buy this game u wont be sorry ,,adults an kids im 54 an it's a cool....  specs;i7-3770k-16gb-960GTX card.....u dont need this much pc power to play it,but alittle more is always better..lol"
257830,Violett,"This was my first forray into the hidden game concept, and I loved it. Violett has great artwork and an intrigueing storyline. I love playing adventure games, and thought this one looked pretty. But after I discovered it was a hidden game and that meant I had to play the game to find all the little things I was hooked."
257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"Not so sure how to feel about this game... a lot of this game is just swarming you with enemies. When you dodge twice, you are immobilized for a second and all the enemies kill you, and if they didn't then you wouldn't be able to dodge anyway because of the snipers. Then it takes SO long to respawn, and is really obnoxious. Not to mention if you go too fast then you will slide off the edge into an abyss and take damage. And I feel like a lot of progressing the game is just walking around in no clear direction and trying to find the secrets, which ends up most of the time you thinking something is a requirement to the story and then dashing to it but you can't make it and take extra damage. I understand the difficulty, but sometimes it is just dumb. I'm going to play more but if it keeps up like this then I might have to stop. I really want to love this game, it is stunningly beautiful in an odd way, very cool, but these problems can be really frustrating."
257870,Eschalon: Book 3,"So far, 2/10. Dreadful, don't know where to go or what to do half the time. The people who say that I'm just stupid and don't know how to play are probably the same butthurt hardcore eschalon fans that have put 4-5x the hours the average person puts in them. Play the first game, and the second, so far this one is indescribably awful."
257930,Race To Mars, Early Access Review
257970,Loren The Amazon Princess,"Not finishd yet, but I absolutely adore this game. As someone who is more aquainted with traditional RPGs, this was a joy to play. Yes, the story is cliche, and yeah the turn-based combat was shallow, but I truly enjoyed my time with Loren the Amazon Princess. The story, artwork, and music are all simple, but done well. This game is the definition of a simple but very solid RPG/Visual novel. I would reccomend this vehemently, but especially to people like me, who have limited experience with Visual Novels.   7.5/10"
257990,Oozi: Earth Adventure,"wow, supermario for idiots"
258010,Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages,10/10
258050,Survivor Squad,Cool and Good.
258070,Probability 0,Fantastic action roguelite with simple controls and a unique cast of bizarre enemies.
258090,99 Spirits,i could not get into this. its not the spelling words that bothered me nor was it the anime style. it was just trying to figure out the guess that got me. maybe because the style is something i'm not use to or i don't know the culture enough. it just wasn't that fun to me.
258180,Deus Ex: The Fall,"When I started playing, I thought this is way below the normally epic standards of the Deus Ex games, but it did start to grow on me and I had a little fun. Still no where near the standard I expected, however I captured an airport and got to take a plane ride, but still only had a few enhancements so was thinking this had to get better, then Boom! The game ended with TO BE CONTINUED. I was speechless and what eventually came from my mouth cannot be repeated here. If you get it for a pound, it might be worth it. I am a huge fan of Deus Ex and have played all of them and praised them as among the best games ever made, but sadly I must call this one poor and give it 2/10. Very disapointed."
258200,Talisman: Prologue,  Gift this to someone you hate!
258220,Blood Knights,"Not terrible! Looks pretty decent at 4k Resolution, controls are fairly flawed, and the story is lacking some substance, but the gameplay is pretty fun."
258240,Tank Operations,"i never thought a game could be as bad as this stinker is, never thought it could be pulled off but these developers managed to do this, you have to actually TRY HARD to make a game so awful this game is unplayable nothing works this game is garbage and not worth a single penny don't even waste your time with this piece of junk of a game i tried the tutorial but i could not do anything i was supposed to. how are you supposed to play a game when the TUTORIAL doesn't even work, that is how BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD this game is. i have played some pretty awful games in my time but this one takes the cake absolutely hands down"
25830,Knights of Honor,Thank you for learning us history trough this game! Helped me learn a lot
258520,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,"the game is beautiful and sounds great, but it's held down by very slow pacing, puzzles that take forever to solve, if you mess up you have to start all over again, and the story doesn't make much sence unless you look up the lore..."
258590,Finn and Jake's Epic Quest,"This game is great, and it's a shame you can only play as Finn &amp; Jake. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing, but ever since  'Adventure Time: Explore The Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!' I was hoping  for multiple playable characters. Otherwise a neat game, easy to pick up and play, loads of iconic bad guys to fight, and the most impressive part being an actually good looking 2D-cartoon-made-3D-videogame that manages to both translate well to the 3D graphics and on top of it keep it's style intact."
258700,Dragon Nest Europe,It gave me a virus and now windows wont even let me download.
258760,Scania Truck Driving Simulator,There is no way to invert the controls so my brake pedal accellerates and vice versa. Do not buy if you have pedals on one axis.
258880,Professional Farmer 2014,worste game! no comment.
258890,Type:Rider,"Less of a game, more of an interactive article. Gives a fun rundown of the history of fonts, lots of stuff I never knew about. The controls are floaty which makes it a bit more difficule than I think the maker intended, but it's still fun. Probably wouldn't recommend it if you hate learning about fonts."
25890,Hearts of Iron III,"Not that I don't like the control I get over an economy, industry, diplomacy, military of a WW2 nation, but it's not for me.  For one, you don't really 'manage' intelligence and politics, you just set a couple bars and hope it works out.  For another, not everything is explained...at all. Watch Youtube videos to better understand some of the mechanics. Personally, if you want to just jump in and get experience, play America to practice controlling an economy and industry, then go Italy for some military experience. Diplomacy matters more to Italy than America, but mostly it's just historical events.  DO NOT GO AS GERMANY IF YOU ARE CLUELESS! THE WAR STARTS, AND LARGELY FOR THE FIRST 2 YEARS, RUNS ON THEIR SCHEDULE! YOU WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY HOW MUCH STUFF HAPPENS AT ONCE!  Also, managing armies isn't always straightforward. Note: if you're army has no supplies, it can move, but it cannot attack an enemy army (can still occupy territory I believe). You will take longer to move over rivers and in mountains without engineers (train lots). Finally, you cannot post any troops in terrritories with less than 2 infrastructure. Seriously, they are foot pounders...WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A ROAD SYSTEM!? Also also, while commanders give bonuses, it's not an easy system to understand. FYI: you set the stars, or 'seniority' of commanders (just dictates how high a command they CAN take).  Higher level: higher command since it'll take awhile to level up...unless they have an ability that's really handy to a particular army right now. Lower levels: tend to be front-line leaders, but not all abilities are useful (ie. supplies reduction is likely useful in Theatre (highest) command, since the most troops will be effected (even if the general is a lower skill level)  Overall, while the sheer ability to command all major aspects of a WW2 nation is nice, not all commands are created equal, not all features and mechanics are explained in useful detail, and at times there is simply too much micro-management for someone like me to enjoy.  Good effort, but improvement is definately possible and I'd argue nessecarry for this series."
258910,Citizens of Earth,terrible terrible terrible! the overall game is great except the save feature doesnt work    BUT.....  how can you be mad at this game
258950,Montague's Mount,"Jesus. Where to start with this one.  +Atmospheric. +Decent music, if repetetitve. +Decent audio  -You need to tweak the settings to actually see anything. -Insanely slow walking speed the entire time. -Every puzzle is convoluted, hiding useful items in locations that force you to backtrack a lot. -Poor performance."
258970,Gauntlet™ ,Very nice game! It is not as good as the Gauntlet for N64 but it is still a fun game to play with friends. I highly recommend it.
2590,Alpha Prime,"Even with less than one hour of play time, I can already see that this game is very basic and generic feeling, and does not withstand the test of time when playing it in 2017. There are simply much better first person shooters that are worth your time."
25900,King's Bounty: The Legend,"Not very impressed with gameplay on this iteration of the game. The UI is clunky and the new, rich graphics don't mess with nearly detailess maps. No important NPC's are marked, making it tedious to follow quest chains unless you're really trying to visually memorize things. They do offer the ability to tag things, but that's like buying furniture you have to assemble yourself. That was the killer. Maps were useless and graphics actually detracted from the game, which is turn based combat. Overall it's okay. I love the strategy aspects and think they could have put their money into better battle graphics and not overly populated scenery."
259060,Dominions 4,"Do not buy this game... It is barely playable and definitely not fun. There is no tutorial and the music is bad. If you are interested in wasting your time and thirty dollars then buy this game (like I did). Otherwise, spend your money on a good game."
259080,Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod,there is something wrong with the mod it keeps doing a fatal exeption 
25910,Supreme Ruler 2020: Gold,Great game
259130,Wasteland 1 - The Original Classic,"If you put the effort in to play this old of a game, you'll find a gem here. Also, as a big fan of Fallout, this is worth playing for the history of it."
259170,Alone in the Dark,"♥♥♥♥ing DRM, can't get passed the intro it just loops wont accept any input from my pc keyboard or gamepad. ♥♥♥♥ these oaks."
259190,Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare,"Right this game is great I loved it as a kid but if you use Windows 8/10 oh boy your going to have a fun time with no FMV's loading, the title menu screwed up and in game the background to pure white and your a shiny blue colour. Audio still works but everything else broken! All broken! There is a fix but makes your game spanish but I don't know spanish so yeah thats good. Until Atari or someone else can be bothered to fix the game its not playable. Overall its a great game but Atari released it to not work on higher OS so you cant play the damn thing. Lucky I got this in the sale or I would not be happy buying this full price. In this review the game gets the thumbs down for me but I really want to give it a thumbs up I do. Right if you don't mind me I'm just going to get this game 'legitimately' on my PCSX2."
259320,Heli Heroes,"  Hey, thats pretty good."
259340,Chicken Shoot Gold,Glitchy and Buggy.. screen tends to go all Green and Pink on multiple PC's
259410,Sneaky Sneaky,"This game is reminiscent of Lolo type gameplay with a cute thief theme. I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Unfortunately, it is easy and short. It could use about twice the length, and more challenging mechanics for enthusiasts."
259430,Zigfrak,i got this game for like 60 cents and completely fotgot about it. i guess thats the downside of starting with the letter z huh (*the more you know*)
259450,Drifter, Early Access Review
259470,Particulars,"Absolutely charming.  First off, it helped me break into deeper subatomic physics (I hadn't moved past neutrons, protons, and electrons for a long time) by experiencing it. I certainly didn't memorize all the different particles and whatnot, but I know what is happening when we talk about the strong and weak forces and the identities of the different quarks.  Second, I didn't catch on to the light symbolism til the end (shame on my part), but it was also true. 'Quarks don't exist in isolation,' themes of reconciliation, progress, balance. I find the relationship between humanity and science to be essential. You'll get more satisfaction out of it the more you consider those bonds. Feel free to compare yourself to the down quark. It was a rich, lovely experience.  Simply put, it has me charmed. &lt;3"
259490,Beast Boxing Turbo,"I'm honestly bored of this game 14 minutes into it. It could be a decent browser-based game but would never be worth the $5 spent on it. I didn't buy it but since it was in my library from a bundle, I thought I would go ahead and give it a try. I don't recommend it at its full price."
259510,Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe,One of few decent VR titles at the time. I loved the original Shufflepuck Cafe as a kid and this is a worthy successor.  It will no doubt be overshadowed by VR bar games with multiplayer and explorable interactive environments now but it's still worth a look if you want something immersive without motion controllers. 
259530,Savant - Ascent,"I played this game to it's supposed end and came back about 2 years later to find all this extra content added in. I replayed it all over again and enjoyed just as much before. This is a really well developed game in terms of playability, no bugs, handling, and when you have an extra few dollars to spend on something worthwhile."
259550,Hero of the Kingdom,"I had low expectations but got this game in a bundle. Started it up just to give it a try. 5 hours later I had completed everything in the game and loved it. Not much replay value, but great story and cool game style."
259570,Eden Star, Early Access Review
259600,Finding Teddy,"(7/10)  Cute little point and click adventure game. Art is very pixely old-school and the music is darkly chippy and enjoyable. There are a couple of pretty strong/interesting ideas here when it comes to solving the puzzles and learning as a player how to interact with the various creatures in the world. Not the longest game around but it doesn't need to be, file it under short and sweet."
259620,3079 -- Block Action RPG,"My favorite in the series.  As much as I love 3089 and 5089, nothing quite captures the surrealist atmosphere and intricate cities like 3079. When I first played 3079, I was dropped straight into a dystopian Scifi world, literally! You fall from the sky and get attacked by demons who have taken over the heavens! You can either die and wake up inside someone's house nursed to health (which is what happened to me) or you can evade the demonic forces and use your wits and your jetpack to land safely on the ground, while the face of the world is being altered by constant faction warfare. Call me nostalgic, but 3089 and 5089 just don't capture the same vibe for me, and as much as I enjoy 3089 and 5089, they are very 'Arcade' in comparison to 3079, which has cities that light up at night, giants that patrol the streets, with giant walls preventing anything from getting in or out, which of course you overcome with your trusty grappling hook.  3079 also features bases in the sky you can raid and take control of, and you can also change faction relations depending on who you are attacking! Want to switch sides? Shoot humanoid Humoids and start working for the arachnid Neanders.  Bases are distincted by the colors used on specific lights, which gets the job done, but a lot more could have been done. Buildings overall have much more interesting layout than in 3089 or 5089 which are based more around outdoor combat with hoverboards and attack ships. While there are Attack Ships in 3079, the controls are not as polished as in 3089 or 5089 from what I've experienced, though I don't fly much, because I usually crash.  While the visuals for 3079 aren't much to look at, they really drive home the rather alienating and surreal atmosphere, and the voxel-based environments allow for destructible environments and terrain, akin to Minecraft and the like. I have yet to blow holes in buildings, but I've certainly dug a few holes with high-powered explosives, something I have not done in 3089 or 5089.  This game is best described as 'Minecraft meets Stalker in a galaxy far far away', but that might be stretching it a bit."
259640,Guise Of The Wolf,i have not been able to play it since its not compatible to Win 10. but if its still buggy like it was when totalbiscuit reviewed it then i would not recomend it but it did get an update and im hopeing its better then it was before.
259660,Void Destroyer,"The Hub mission made me uninstall the game. Sure seems impossible and I'm just done trying, it's not in any way fun.  Guess I'll go ahead and elaborate. My gripes are thus:  Allied AI is utterly stupid. It's supposed to be player choice about playing in Pilot Mode in control of a single ship, but the AI is so damn dumb you will never beat a mission that way. They fly straight into death. They do not maneuver to dodge anything. They are slow to obey issued commands or simply ignore them. This is an RTS game that has a terrible RTS interface. In some sort of insane design choice control groups and formations are separated - you can't grab a swath of units and tell them to do something because they won't move or stay in formation, and so will arrive piecemeal at wherever you send them, neatly forming a line so enemy forces can eliminate them a few at a time. You can control group formation leaders, but if they die - you lose the control group. There's also no way to see the overall status of a control group at a glance. Unlike in Warcraft / Starcraft, you cannot see individual unit status with the group selected; you have no way to know who's close to dead without pausing time and examining each unit individually, and there isn't even a good interface for doing that much.  Nothing is taught. Prime example: in The Hub mission, you have 3 bases full of enemies bearing down on you and you can't even generate resources to make anything. So you have to tell a Tug ship to go over to a nearby asteroid to pull it closer to the base for resources. Except I couldn't figure out why commanding it to go to a extra large asteroid or a medium asteroid did nothing. As I finally found out from the forums, it's because it only works on a 'large' asteroid and no other size category. Not only does it not make any sense, game doesn't even bother to tell you.  I absolutely applaud Chaosavy (the dev) who is very active on Void Destroyer 1 and 2 steam communities and seems like a generally swell guy, but there's no way I can recommend VD 1. At every turn I'm reminded of how Strike Suit Zero Director's Cut, Freelancer, etc ... did everything about ship mode better, and how Homeworld did everything about RTS mode better. I really, really wanted to play through VD 1 to learn the backstory of VD 2, but I'm just not going to ♥♥♥♥ away my time trying to beat this 1 single mission that's 9000 times more difficult than every mission before it. I'm sure it's possible, but I simply don't think it's worth the investment of time to wrestle with all that is bad about this game to see what lies beyond it."
259680,Tales of Maj'Eyal,"I bought this game on a whim during the Steam winter sale. I wasn't even sure if I liked Roguelikes, let alone whether or not I'd like this game. However, it has completely shattered my expectations in a good way. I love the looting, the fighting, the tactics, the world it builds, and the history is hints at through books and other sources in the game. It's a very fun game that you can play in short bursts due to its turn-based nature, or you can sit and play for hours without even realizing that it's now dark outside.   This is a game that I can see myself playing for years to come, and I'm very happy with this purchase. At this price tag, you can't go wrong for hours and hours of actual fun. Pick this one up if you like turn-based games, or roguelikes. You won't regret it."
259720,Fading Hearts,"I'm not sure if this was written by someone with any life experience but allow me to give you my deal breaker and it's the story.  The Y2K bug apparently managed to orphan the main character and the love interests. Yes. The Y2K bug. That's just the start of the insanity.  This game is not worth $15. Please, for the love of God, buy anything else worth your time or money."
259740,Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart,Sound: 7 Graphics: 8 Story: 8 Gameplay: 9 Commands: 9 Keep the gamer playing: 8 DLCs / Expansions: - Time to load / lag: 9.5 Bugs / Problems: 9.5  Final Score: 8.5
259760,Two Brothers,OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OHHHHHHHHHHHHH THIS GAME ITS THE WORST GAME EVER IHATE THIS GAME AND IHATE U NAMKE CUZ THIS GAME ITS ♥♥♥♥ BUT ILOVE MY RAOR IN THIS GAME 3/10
259780,Nimble Quest,"A real time 'RPG' game with snake controls and auto-attacking characters as they pass enemies. Snake with upgrades. If you want it get it while it's on sale.   This game sort of feels like a big version of those flash games where there's decent enough gameplay but it's stretched out with upgrades and such to make it longer than it feels like it should go on for. At points it feels like you need to grind to get gems to get upgrades to even progress even if you're playing your best. It's fun enough where it's not to the point of feeling like a chore (as long as you don't play it all at once) but you will certainly be repeating runs through this so get comfortable with the first several levels you'll see them lots. Also a tip if you do play it that getting kill counts on the front characters decreases how much it costs to upgrade them up a star, so switch up which starting character depending on who you want to upgrade next.   It's not the best game by any stretch, but for how low of price you can get it on a sale (I got it for like, 24 cents more or less) if you have an itch for a game with upgrades and have run out of things on flash game sites, and you really enjoy the game snake then this is a functional enough game. Pretty niche and personally I don't like snake enough to replay it after I finish it so that's why It's a thumbs down from me."
25980,Majesty 2,"This game is strangely addictive and features a concept that is unique and was sadly never picked up again. Buy it, try it, die by it."
259810,Home Sheep Home: Farmageddon Party Edition,"Home Sheep Home 2 is a very cute little puzzle-platformer in which you help three sheep to get out of different levels. Sometimes the things you have to do are hilariously absurd: you throw your sheep in the air with dynamite, use them as jumping stones, fix the gap in the electric wire with the sheep's body... Don't worry though - no matter what you do to them, your curly heroes will end up just fine.  In total there are 45 levels plus bonus ones (which you have to unlock first); they are not particularly hard, but if you're stuck, you can use in-game hints. Puzzles have just enough variety to not become repetitive, some of them are pretty creative and, in addition to that, everything is very nicely drawn - the game looks like a picture book for children, and this style suits it well. Besides the main campaign there is a lot to unlock - the game has plenty of hidden items, achievements and a score system for those who like perfecting everything. All in all - for me Home Sheep Home 2 was fun and pleasant experience, so I'd say that, if you like puzzles, this little game is worth your time and money."
259830,Wooden Sen'SeY,Nice art style and the controls handle well. Check out some game play here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laPr47TOomw 
259870,OMG Zombies!,10/10
259890,Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming,...
25990,Majesty: Gold Edition,one of the best strategy games of the early 2000s
259940,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK Vol. 2,"Volume 2 is technically the third stand-alone You Don't Know Jack game, the second being YDKJ Sports. Much like volume 1, the humor is the driving force behind the game along with the trivia. A few new features have been added to distinguish it from volume 1, such as the introduction of DisorDat and Celebrity Collect Calls, that keep the game fresh. Like the previous installment, this is a sound purchase for trivia masters, comedy lovers, and almost anyone else."
259960,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK Vol. 3,"Chronogically speaking, this is the eighth iteration of You Don't Know Jack. Compared to the previous entries of the series, the artstyle has taken a noticeably more chic look, evocative of a '70s style. This is accentuated by the new question type, the Three Way. Unlike the focused entries of the series (e.g., Sports), this is worthy to stand on its own merits. Comedy and trivia combine to make a good party game or individual test of knowledge. Whether you buy it solo or in the Classic Pack, it's a good investment."
259980,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK Vol. 4 The Ride,"If you don't know You Don't Know Jack, you don't know jacks***."
2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,"play as an insane undead or sewer dwelling rat eater, dont mind all those other clans.  a good vampire RPG, i would recommend it over all those other blood sucking games, the tabletop is ♥♥♥♥ though."
260000,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK MOVIES,"Similar to You Don't Know Jack Sports, this iteration of the franchise deals exclusively with Film trivia. Most of what I said in my YDKJ Sports review can be applied here, just change 'sports' to 'movies.' Movie buffs will get the most out of this; comedy will be the saving grace for everyone else. Again, I think it would be prudent to purchase this in the bundle, and that's where my recommendation falls."
260020,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK SPORTS,"This is the first of a few You Don't Know Jack games that tack on a particular theme, which in this case is sports. Once again, the overall style and format is the same as volumes 1 and 2, the only real difference being in content of trivia. Rather than presenting a host of general trivia, the bulk of questions have to do with sports. Comedy is still a good part of this game, but I don't think anyone beyond sports buffs will be able to make any impression on the scoreboard. Overall, I wouldn't suggest buying this on its own. Instead, it would be best to purchase it in the Classic Pack along with eight other YDKJ games. My recommendation here is conditional on that, otherwise I think it would be a poor purchase."
260040,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK TELEVISION,"As Sports and Movies before it, You Don't Know Jack Television continues the trend of focusing on a particular area of trivia. For the sake of brevity, my reviews of the two previous versions can be translated here. Once more, don't purcase this alone; buy it in the Classic Pack."
260130,Agarest Zero,"  Generations of War Zero is the second installment of the Agarest storyline. This review will be somewhat short as it vastly resembles what I wrote about the first one.  Pros:  1. Offered a prelude to the background story of the first installment which enlightened me on certain concepts that were used in the first but was not thoroughly explained. 2. Characters were well done and likeable; could definitely see where they resembles characters in the first. 3. Improvement on the battle system most welcomed. However, once again, this company comes back with the inane...alright will explain in the con. 4, Monsters and graphics was improved for battle areas. 5. Pro for me, but may not be for others is...long gameplay required to complete which is engaging and can be absolutely comical.  Cons: 1. Some things are lost in translation. I dont...know what...the hell the card thing in the beginning affected really. It was poorly explained. 2. Yes, I played at the hardest difficulty; BUT BUUUT, there is this absolutely ridiculous jump in difficulty at times in these games and it is unexplainable even when I am vastly overleveled. Boom you just 'dead' in like one hit. Really fam, come again. 3. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ true ending business...listen...I dont know what to do to get the true ending. There is no hint or suggestion even after I completed the game, how to get it and also, I am kinda finguring out what it may be but seriously now, there must be a way to understand how to proceed. 4. Lastly, it was definitely shorter and doesnt mean it fell far from the face...but I always wonder why the endings of all these games seem rushed or not fulfilling...Maybe its because I havent gotten the true ending. 5. I didnt address this in my first game of the series, but I am gonna do it here. Aumm listen... if the game cost $20.00, tell me why the DLC collectively cost as much as close to $100? Maybe unnuh lose some screw up there while adding price to those things. Like 10 dollars for voices. Eeeeh, really fam? come again.  Overall great game that I would recommend to others interested in JPRG games.  P.S NO I DID NOT RECEIVED LE GAME FOR FREE! BOUGHT IT WITH ME OWN MONIES..sorry didnt untick the box and cant edit that."
260160,The Last Tinker: City of Colors,"just played and finished this game and to me this game was...meh! it wasnt bad and it wasnt good, the storyline was ok for a kids game, i would of like voices, not gibberish while talking to ai but oh well, overall its an ok gasme but not one i will be coming back to anytime soon 6/10"
260190,Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure,Nice game!
260210,Assassin's Creed Liberation,"This is a short AC game (For me, it took about 18 hours). That said, what it does is done well.    For people who've played other AC games:  It is much more stealth focused than the other AC games and has less attention towards combat. This is largely done through the persona system, essentially three identities to build and reduce notoriety on. While recruitment of assassins is done away with, I personally didn't notice the absence of it. The engine feels like that of AC:3, allowing for climbing of trees and less micromanagement. However, on PC it runs much better. Honestly, I feel like this is the kind of game that the creators of AC:3 wanted to make, but failed to produce. The fast travel is limited, with single-destination portals at the edges of the map, to the three locations in the game: the bayou, New Orleans, and Chichen Itza. As always, there are collectibles and side-quests, although the side-quests are slightly lacking. There is little coverage of the 'present-day' story.   For everyone  The narrative was well done. There's a good connection between the mechanics and the story. AC:Liberation goes over topics like racism and slavery, and the roles of women in the 18th century, but not overtly. None of the characters feel like charicatures or two-dimensional. It's a decent introduction to the AC genre, but I'd definitely reccommend AC:2 or AC:4 over this for that purpose."
260230,Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™,"This is a World War 1 game, but it doesn't glorify the battling or have you on the front lines taking out the enemy. Instead you are shown how truly terrible war is...how much it ruins beyond those lost on the battlefield. It's fun, educational, and heartbreaking at times.  The gameplay is fairly easy for the most part. Some light puzzles with some action here and there. It's also a relatively short game, but for the price it seems to be worth every penny."
260250,Blood of the Werewolf,"It's a solid action platformer that doesn't overstay its welcome, but isn't for people new to the genre. The game can be more frustrating than is typical of a platformer and I think that's where the hate stems from. However, the switch between human and werewolf forms keeps the gameplay fresh and I found the controls worked as you'd expect (massive praise for platformers that live and die on the tightness of their controls)."
260330,Flockers,"The game looked very intriguing at first, but just left me wanting to play Lemmings. It was very boring and maybe if I get back to it one day and play a little longer, I will change my review. For now, I just can’t invest the time in this cumbersome title."
260380,Ninja Cats vs Samurai Dogs,"Fun game to kill time. Would to prefer to play on my Note 4, or any mobile device in general. It isn't really a PC game. Even though i like it better to be playing with a mouse. My Android device can do the same. Just connect a OTG Cable (On the go) and plug in that usb mouse and I'm set!"
260410,Get Off My Lawn!,Be aware of game crashes.
260430,The Four Kings Casino and Slots,"I enjoyed the game very munch before the last verision change, a series of vip wheels vs a percentage marker, made the game very confusing. Many players I know in the game agreed, with this new format as being confusing. The curiclure icons makes you guess, as to where you really are in the game. This makes the VIP progression extreamly confusing."
260510,World Basketball Tycoon,this game does not work and i have tried twice this game needs to be fixed
260530,So Many Me,"So Many Me is a game I'd recommend to those who enjoy puzzle games which take some time to complete but are not wanting to play a puzzle game where they end up going on Youtube for all the answers.  The graphics are astounding and have a child-like feel to them but that doesn't mean that adults and teenagers alike can't enjoy them too.   Using your many replications you go on a quest to save the world and the girl. Going through the game Filo and his many 'Me's' often make jokes about 'saving the princess', 'getting the thing on the floor because you will need it later' and many other similar jokes. The concept of having many replications of yourself and completing puzzles with them definitely made the game more interesting to play.  There are 3 unique forms of travel in So Many Me (apart from on foot) which are by Jellophant (Tank), Jellosaur (Dinosaur), Balloonbird (Bird). The forms of travel allow you to travel on spikes and destroy EVERYTHING, destroy vertical walls and jump higher and fly and destroy horizontal walls respectively.   Obviously you have a Story which you can play and complete. Within this story are many costumes and coins which you can get through extra effort to eventually fully complete the game.  Like many other reviews, the only important downside is the Bosses. The bosses themselves are not too hard but there are hardly any checkpoints in these battles so you have to memorise the landscape and the movements of the boss.   Personally I had trouble with one section of the game.    After the Final Boss (The guy you meet at the beginning) there is an escape part of the level. The path of this section isn't too difficult but the meteors sometimes hit you at the ONLY moments where you either dodge and fall off the map or jump off the platforms into spikes. The best part of all this is that there are NO checkpoints.     If anybody wants to know, I got all achievements in 10 hours and 36 minutes which involves the main story, extra missions (Chrono Castle) and all collectables.  I know it says 11 hours on my profile. That's because I left the game on while writing this review :D"
260550,Haunted,"I voted this for the 'Strangest Team Ever' Award 2016. Your team has a pirate, a kilt-wearing Scot, the Pope, a wolf and a goldfish. And they all talk behind your back...  This game is full of eveything I love about a funny adventure game. Banter between the characters, unexpected humourous scenes, that cutscene that just cracks you up. Better than Monkey Island 3...  Original Review: This game is delightful! One of the best point and click adventures I've played in a long time."
260570,Gray Matter,"Very good and mysterious adventure game. Beautiful illustrations, good voice acting and characters. Maybe not top ten game but quite well."
260650,Cold War,"If you are addicted to Splinter Cell, or any other stealth TPS, you should get this."
260690,Dark Fall 1: The Journal,"One of the most enjoyable point-and-click games I've ever played.  Take the role of a reluctant paranormal investigator: You've bitten off more than you can chew, but you have to find your brother somehow! Creep around the not-so-deserted train station/hotel in search of clues while witnessing hair-raising paranormal activity. I recommend keeping a pen and paper beside you as you solve these puzzles."
260710,Dark Fall 2: Lights Out,"Darkling Room's sequel to Dark Fall: The Journal, Dark Fall: Light's Out ended up being quite disappointing compared to its predecessor. I wanted to like it, due to the fact I'm a massive fan of Dark Fall, and the Lost Crown also, but this game was very mediocre and I didn't enjoy it at all. As much as I loved the atmosphere and visuals, the story was uninteresting and the gameplay was too confusing. Overall I wouldn't recommend this, and would point you in the direction of Dark Fall: The Journal or the Lost Crown - 2 fantastic games created by Jonathan Boakes at Darkling Room."
260730,Desperados - Wanted Dead or Alive,"Good game, ♥♥♥♥ port."
260750,Neighbours from Hell,"A childhood classic long gone with damaged discs but returned by means of steam. at least the first one, i still have the second one on cd."
260790,1001 Spikes,"This game is incredibly difficult, but that's what makes it so tremendously rewarding. The controls are very tight, giving you a lot of precision to work with. Some people say the game feels too trial-and-error for them, which is sort of true, but that's part of the reason that I love the game. There are a lot of patterns that you'll start to learn that will help you to avoid obstacles, but sometimes you jump onto a platform that look safe and suddenly you're full of spikes. Sometimes you'll say 'that block DEFINITELY has spikes in it;' you land on it, there aren't any spikes, but you're expecting them so you freak out and jump off in a panic only to fly face-first into a dart. Sometimes this lack of 'red blocks = spikes, yellow statues = darts' means that you'll die to traps that you couldn't possibly predict; I can see how that could become frustrating quickly, but with 1,001 lives to burn through, I never thought 'wow this is 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t,' it was just something to catalogue into 'sneaky traps on this level.' And honestly, I love that tense feeling of 'what could be in this next area that's going to kill me?' It's not so random that you can't outwit some of the traps, but it isn't so formulaic that you can learn 'this means this so do this' to breeze through levels. I think this game could have VERY easily gone in an entirely different direction if it wasn't for the level design and the soundtrack. All of the levels are built in a way that makes it possible to speedrun through them if you're willing to spend the time learning the traps and perfecting the technique. I've had hours of fun just playing one level with a friend, passing the controller back and forth while we try to perfectly time a jump, then a knife throw, then do a crazy high-jump wibble-wobble to fall underneath a dart with surgical precision. That was fun because the levels aren't overly long, some of the trips are hidden but not completely unknown (spikes flash for a second before they pop out, darts only come out of statue mouths, etc.). There are no invisible blocks that you're going to bump into. There are some tiles that fall out from under you or ceiling blocks that will fall onto your head, but these will usually (I can't say 'always' with 100% certainty) be marked or have some sort of audible warning; you can escape them if your reflexes are fast enough. However, my reflexes are not usually fast enough and I have to learn some of these things by getting killed by them. The soundtrack is well-made and a real pleasure to listen to if you're into chip-tune music. It definitely has that 8-bit NES-era feel to it, but it's all layered and orchestrated in a way that makes it so much more complex than 'bleepity bloop background noises.' You typically won't get new background music until you progress to the next area of the map, which means you'll probably be hearing the same music for a long time. That might not be your bag, but I can say that personally I never got tired of the soundtrack, even when I spent 400 lives on the same level. I do still get a weird sense of anxiety whenever I hear the music from the fire maps, though... Overall, this game is really a blast to experience, especially since you can unlock new characters by finding the secret golden skulls on each map. The unlockable characters will only be able to grab coins from the main levels, but they all have their own little differing mechanics that makes them fun to play the extra modes with. If you're planning on playing this game solo, go in knowing that there's going to be a lot of repetition while you try to learn the levels. It's still a lot of fun, but I would recommend having a friend to share in the good-natured cornucopia of death that you're about to experience.  In short, buy this game because it's great."
260990,Odesi Music Composition,"OK, I just used this tool successfully, although not in the way one might expect. First off, I find it unpolished UX-wise. It looks nice enough, but the very, very first thing I did when I started a new project was to type a title with a capital R. It doesn't let you type a capital R. It lets you type other capital letters. But not R. The way it turns alt-tabs into 'start/stop playback', its inability to fit my laptop screen correctly, the way it makes my trackpad freeze up occasionally(this is a thing I've seen Unity games do too, I have no idea what the common cause is) - all very irritating stuff.  Regardless, after a few minutes of negativity, I did have a chord progression and bassline going, roughly as fast as the claims said. This is where I stopped following standard procedure and moved over to OpenMPT to track in the chords in by hand, and threw a melody on top of them. The melody was great but did not fit the progression I had, so I threw away the chords and plugged in some of my own. My workflow tends to lead with motif and melody and has chords follow, which presents a sort of philosophical problem for tools like these: Did it actually help to employ all this technology? I mean, I did write something that I wouldn't have written otherwise. But I did it in a strange 'sidechannel' way where I did not simply sketch the thing in Odesi and then build on that: I more-or-less assumed that I was going to go roll the dice again as soon as I made the jump from MIDI to tracker sequence, and make destructive changes in the process of arriving at a more final arrangement.  This isn't the only tool of this type that I have. I also have Sundog Scale Studio, B-Step, and Rapidcomposer. I like any tool that tries to make building and editing a sequence a more fluid process. But I find that I only take them out rarely, none of them are a silver bullet, and they each do things quite differently despite sharing some concepts. This one is less polished-feeling than Sundog and B-Step, but more so than Rapidcomposer(or least, more than the last time I checked in on that program)."
2610,GUN,words are unexplainable for this game
261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,10/10
261110,Killer is Dead,"KiD: Nightmare Edition is a fun, yet flawed title.  Here's a short list of the pros and cons...  Pros: - Savage and satisfying swordplay. - Phenomenal art style that's a mix of the aggressive cel-shading of Killer7 and the semi-realistic cartoon look of No More Heroes. - Decent length. Approximately 6 hours to beat the story on normal (+ more hours of gameplay for the side content / higher difficulties / rankings).  - Crazy and creative scenarios / set-pieces only seen in Suda51 titles. - A great introduction to newcomers of the genre due to its simplicity, yet meaty enough for veterans to function as the perfect 'feel good'-game.  Cons: - Minor camera issues when the action gets too hectic. Sadly a common thing in this genre... (*cough* MGR *cough*) - The left arm skills don't match the savageness of the swordplay. - The PC port is lacking in options. Only featuring LOW / NORMAL / HIGH presets, basic resolution settings and a frame rate cap.  Other: - Gigolo missions... yea ._.'  To conclude,  Get this game if you're fan of Suda51 / the character action genre / aesthetically pleasing titles. If you're just a passerby, approach it with caution (wait for sale)."

261350,Steam Bandits: Outpost, Early Access Review
261430,AION Free-to-Play,"Pretty good mmorpg, but looks like the steam version is barely optimized... YES it took me +200h to realize XD "
261470,Distant Worlds: Universe,"First off, this game more than any other makes me wish Steam would give reviewers an option to rank games on a numerical scale rather than 'yes/no'.  This is not a bad game... it's just that the vast majority of gamers will not like this game; but not only will most gamers not like this game, even a large percentage of strategy 4x gamers will not enjoy this game.  Are people that say this is the greatest game of all time wrong? are they nuts? No they are not. This is an absolutely amazing game if you are a certain type of gamer; question is though... are you that type of gamer?  I would describe this game as 'The World's most complicated Real Time Stratagy Game'; as in many ways this game plays and feels like a RTS with 4x elements tacked on. Some of the 4x elements feel incomplete like planetary management while others are very well done (custom ship design being a good example).  Now that's not to say that there is a lot going on with this game; the galaxy map is very much alive; zoom in on a developed star system and you will see a game which is very much alive in terms of activity. One thing lacking in many 4x titles are the pressence of interactable civilian units, they are very much a noticable part of the game in Distant Worlds. The galaxy is full of mining, trading, construction, and other non-military vessals traveling between planets, moons, and other star systems; and those civilain vessals? They can be targeted and destroyed by enemy nations and pirates. The map as a whole, it's very much alive, moons orbit plantets, planets orbit suns; and best of all it's all interactable; planets and moons can have colonies and outposts built on them, asteroids are mineable, even gas giants and nebulas make for vital fuel resources.  Which brings me to the fuel system, which really symbolizes what people love and hate about this game; it's complex and no other game handles ship range and fuel quite like it. In Master of Orion 2 range and fuel was super simple; your tech level and ship design decided how far your ships could travel away from your colonies and outposts, that was it, simple. DW:U decided to go with each individual ship having their own fuel storage, so basically each ship warps around the galaxy, using up fuel with each FTL jump, they run low on fuel, and then they have to head back to a starbase or fuel extractor to refuel; oh! and it gets even more realistic! Each starbase and fuel outpost can only carry so much fuel, now THAT is realistic. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! There are actually mutiple types of fuel based on what type of reactors your ships use, making finding the right type of fuel in the galaxy vitaly important. BUT WAIT THERE'S EVEN MORE!!! There's a type of ship you can construct that acts as a mobile fuel depot; it's an ingenius unit that is vital to fleet operations behind enemy lines.  Sound great right? Well at this point now you find out what kind of gamer you are. At first no matter who you are the fuel system is pretty cool when your little scout ships are out exploring the glaxy, when your being attacked by small pirate fleets, and when you send small fleets to counter said pirate fleets.  And then war happens. The Shakturi are invading the galaxy, the galaxy needs you as it's savior, you need to assemble a super fleet and destory and stop the Shakturi from conquering the universe! AHH YEAH! Wartime baby! Super Fleets! Big Awesome Space Battles! Everyone loves Big Awesome Space Battles! So you build a super fleet, and you order the majority of your warships to assemble at one of your systems at the edge of your empire and create an armada that will win the war. They're all there, except that some of them are now low on fuel, no problem you order them to refuel in the system, but now the starbase is out of fuel, so now you have to disassemble your fleet and micromanage each ship and find fuel for them in nearby star systems; if you don't want to deal with the logistics of keeping your fleet fueled you hit an automate button... but now the automation completely disassembled your armada and it turns out that you are going to have to deal with the minutiae of keeping your fleet fueled... and then you think, 'you know what would be awesome? if you could just hit a little button and have all the ships in the fleet share fuel with each other.'  TIME SPENT ON TASKS DURING A LARGE GALACTIC WAR: Attacking and defending outposts with small fleets: 49% Micromanaging the logistics of keeping your fleets fueled: 50% Big Awesome Space Battles!!! : 1% SOME people actually like this. MOST do not.  Oh and remember the ship I mentioned that works as a mobile fuel depot? It's really awesome when you find out it's bugged due to a corrupted save.   I could write a novel on every litle thing this game does right and wrong so I'll just quickly mention a few other things cause I've already spend way to much time writing this review.  The Good: As I said before, the galaxy map is a very detailed and rich environment; it has a truly 'Epic' feel to it. Lots of customization, ship customization, map customization, heck even game mechanics are customizable. An amazing modding community that really picked up the ball in areas where the devopers came up short. The diplomacy system in this game could be worse. Good music and effects, overall good audio. Many of the empire mechanics can be automated.  The Bad: If you think that a game as customizable as this would have a race creator, you would be wrong. The diplomacy system in this game could be much better. Have I mentioned it's rather buggy? Dated graphics. While automation in certain areas works well, in others it's terrible, and sometimes you have to either choose to have something completely automated or not at all (your miltary fleet is the ultimate example of this).  The Ugly: The User Interface.  The main reason I can't recommend this game is because not everyone who likes 4x strategy games will like this one; sure there are people who consider this the greatest 4x of all time; but those same people aren't bothered by chronic micromanagment. 7/10"
261510,Tesla Effect,Thats a great game i enjoyed every moment of it. :)
261530,Lifeless Planet,"Lifeless Planet has an alright story, but you spend too much of your time running through repetitve obstactles and terrain for a small piece of said story. The few puzzles you encounter are also very simple. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this game, if you're interested wait for it to go on sale... And set up a macro for 'W.'"
261570,Ori and the Blind Forest,"Ridiculously well done little metrodvania-type platformer. It has great graphics and atmosphere, a good soundtrack, and excellent gameplay. It is one of those games that is so polished and good looking you feel like you are playing a piece of art. I highly recommend it."
261600,Basketball Pro Management 2014,"What a piece of trash. Takes forever to even get into a 'game' and there's basically nothing to do. And when I say 'forever' I mean the game starts with asking you to 'delete leagues' ('the more the faster the game will run') and then stays on that screen for 15 minutes. What kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design is that?   Stay away from this waste of time. If this is in a bundle it would be a reason not to get it, just to make sure the developers don't get anything for this."
261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"  After doing one run, I can really find This game ALOT of fun. I have all the DLC, (I have yet to Acess them though)  To be honest this is very fun, But rather short.    The Basics"
261680,Journal,Beautifully illustrated visual novel game about a girl dealing with personal life troubles. It is an interesting world to walk through as you go through the days of her life and the journal she records it. You primarily follow the story by walking around her home town with occassional dialogue choices. If you like the visual novel approach this certainly would have appeal to you.
261700,Eryi's Action,"Plays like an ice level (slipping and sliding everywhere) yet expects precision.  If you want something that'll kill you over and over and make you  enjoy  it, play Super Meat Boy or I Wanna Be The Guy instead."
261720,Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead,"What a massive pile of ♥♥♥♥. Very annoying music, sexist, crappy unresponsive controls, poor virtually none existant tutorial. AVOID at all costs. Worst game I have ever purchased on steam. Unistalled never to played again. Complete waste of time and money."
261740,Humans Must Answer,STAY CLEAR! no mouse support and from what i've seen on the forum they are too lazy too make it work. their excuse is 'our game is different'. as if. I wouldn't play this even if a was paid to do it  This developer goes on my stay-away-from list
261760,Lichdom: Battlemage,"This game has had great potential. Using Magic feels powerfull and fighting enemys is a lot of fun. At least for the first few hours and the game also doesn't look bad,  But after 13 hours i had enough.  These are the reasons why i can't reecommend this game:  -The system for finding Spell Fragments and crafting Spells from it is absolutely obscure and more then badly explained.  -The crafting system doesn't really make much sense or at least you can't make much of it because information is obscured by a terribble, fiddly Ai that hides every bit of info, makes it hard to understand what does what, makes it a chore to compare different elements for crafting spells and barely if at all makes it possibble for you to logically follow the process so that you can aim to craft anything specific you want.  -The game is SUPER BAD ar explaining everything. For example: after beating the fourth boss i still have no idea what the blue bar under the boss obvvious healthbar actually means or what causes his rising and falling and what that means for me.  -A lot of the in itself interesting forms to throw magic around are utterly useless. for example the Lob where you throw a magic projectile in an arc. But you have no real idea where it is gonna land and the rays or better the aimed projectile with a slight homing abbility will ALWAYS be better.  -The levels look nice but are empty and liveless. Aditionally they are badly designed. Surfaces that look like you could walk on them are in fact an instant death. Wich makes no sense because you can't juimp nor can you really bosh enemys of ledges so why have it there at all?  - Checkpoints are terribble. As mentioned before i more then once died because i tried to avoid enemy attacks onto a surfcae that looked walkable. That often then meant that i had to play the last 20 to 40 minutes of battles again because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoints are so far away from one another. You also can't save anytime and have to rely on those.  -You will fight the same enemys again and again and again and again. Repetition is the big word for this game.  -Especially Archer, that can hit you instandly and in quick succesion and are going to be the bain of your fun.  -Seriosuly, the designers obviously know this too, since Archers are THE ENEMY you are gonna have to fight the most BY FAR. Increased diffculty in battles often means, how many more archers are gonna spawn at the same time?  -I mean seriously SERIOSULY. It often feels as if the designers thought: 'Hm that boss isn't challenging enough lets spam Archers with throw down effects so it's a bit more difficult.'  All in all, if you can get it for around 5 bucks, sure throw a look at it.  But i would not recommend the full price or even half the price."
261880,Corporate Lifestyle Simulator,The game play is repetive and like a flash game. Some wonderful inventive wepons but achingly dull level design. Seems like a gimmik with no end product.
261900,The Real Texas,"This is a fantastic open-world sort of... Zelda / adventure game hybrid? It's hard to pin down. It's a bit like Ultima 7, if you remember that one, and it doubles down on being weird in a lot of awesome ways. You MAY need a walkthrough at points, and the shooting is hard to get used to, but it's absolutely worth snagging regardless just to experience it."

261940,The Mysterious Cities of Gold - Secret Paths,"I purchased this game on Kickstarter having grown up with the original series. After also watching the first series (30 years later) my 4 year old son was super keen to dive straight into this game. He loved it and probably would give it like a billion stars. Here is my slightly more objective review as played through with a 4yr old.   Pros     A fun game for kids. Starts out quite easy but gets much harder at the end. Nothing a gaming experienced adult could not do fairly easily. The thinking puzzles are probably harder than the timing/movement ones as the former could not all be done without my help.    A great game for teaching kids mouse control. To begin my son could hardly use a mouse, by the end he was dodging pirates as well as I could (despite the hit area problems, see below)    The story was decent despite not having seen the second series of the show. Cut scenes were good.    Cons     The hit area on many of the buttons and triggers (PC/Steam version) was really poor. Still playable but the arrow often had to target the ground below the button rather than the button itself. This is clearly an issue of the touch device/console port which does not cater for much finer mouse precision.    The puzzles are fairly repetitive basic game mechanics (click this button to open this door to grab this key, etc..) and are not realistic to the storyline in any way, just there to make the game playable.    In the final cut scene the   ghost of MU says 'none the less there is something else you must know...' GAME CREDITS!  ... what what!? I guess I will have to watch the show :(   Overall good game for kids but probably not for adults even if they are die hard fans off the show."
261960,Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love,It's good if you like games that don't make any sense
2620,Call of Duty,"It's a good game when it works, but I've seen some of the reviews about the graphics of this game, you have to understand when this game came out. Really the only part I like about this game is the Russian campaign of storming the Reichstag. I'd wait till a updated version is released. I beat the game before but now I can't make it past the 3rd level before it crashes.   7/10"
262000,Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers,"I've never played the original gabriel knight games, so I'm new into the storyline, but I gotta say, if you're a story driven gamer Like me, you should give this one a go. Basically, Play it for the marvelous story, the gameplay is good, not great, but if the graphics are an important factor in your gaming experience.... steer clear of it.  First the good:  The Story is interesting and develops at a nice rate, and draws you in with every chapter - or day - you play through. You follow gabriel Knight, a writer that investigates a series of murders with voodoo roots in New orleans in 1993 with the police department for his supposed best seller, and then the story grows deeper. I found it quite charming that they didnt try and modernize it, quite refreshing. The voice acting is quite good, and the scripts are witty and enjoyable. 10/10 in this part.  Now... the bad: being this a point and click you wont expect QTEs or car chases, or fighting segments, But the characters could move in a really disturbingly clunky way. You need gabriel to go to on side of a room to get... a pair of scissors. he will crawl there, take the scissors, say something and then, there's a pause. Its a couple of seconds in which the character stays still, you cant control it, or order any actions and you just have to wait for it to pass. Its as if you took the scissors, and then needed to look at them and think 'oh these are scissors, Scissors cut stuff. NOW i can move on'. This was a recurring thing and it broke down the flow of the game more often than it should.  Another thing, that really disappointed me, was the appearance.   It was a bit all over the place. I'm not obsessed with graphics, but its a bit of an eyesore that You're playing a remaster issued somewhere between 2013/14 and the models seem to be out of the sims 1, with clunky animations and odd textures. This by itself isn't bad, but you have beautifully painted backgrounds and lovely cutscenes in a painting like style. THEN you had another style of art in the same game, when you interacted with NPCs. Two drawn portraits would appear over the game with facial animations that sometimes cutted down the drawing on the lip or brow area and that had Nothing to do with the cutscenes Nor the game models.   I would love love love to see it in some sort of animated style like... I don't know, any of the daedalic games, consistent and according to the marvelous story."
262060,Darkest Dungeon®, Early Access Review
262080,Iron Soul,I recomend it because the graphics on the game play is great better that the clip scenes and the fighting is dificult with nothing to aim with but with a bigger chalenge the funner the game gets and i really dont like how the persons face pops up in the corner when there talking and its kinda glichy with the peps talkin u know what im sayin ok so i recomend it :D
262100,Trench Run,"Great game, very fast pased and fun, great pixel art, the only problem is no one plays it. :/"
262120,Toy Soldiers: Complete,"I played the game on Xbox, both the original and cold war. And was gifted this by a friend, I wish i could return it for him...  Deciding to complete the WWI campaigns first I played threw them, i was a bit surprised at first finding how this versions units had changed. Mortars were no longer AT weapons but now gas launchers, There were anti tank guns too, Armoured trucks functioned like cold-war APCs and the AI vehicles took a lot more interest in destroying turrets. Planes and tanks now needed battery charge;  Not bad, it was clear though espeically with the bostgame they'd more or less reskinned the Coldwar game for the WWI game...  Then came the first boss, the TSAR tank, or, more likely then didn't come... It simply rolled out, entred the main battlefield and froze. not shooting, not deploying troops, it was just pelted by my artillery emplacements...  I decided to retry it, probably on my end right? Nope same thing again...  After that i got the AA gun mark II, which atleast in player hands is massively inferior to the MK I, it shoots like a shotgun, your turret AI can machine gun it liek crazy, while humans can't... the original AA from TS was much better, a heavier MG.  Then came a mission in the Trainyard, bombers turned up the they circled away from my turrets dropping bombs and either died or flew off. Next some elite troops spawned, got stuck on the traintracks running in circles and died to artillery fire... And then finally came the helicopters. The original ones were slow sorta derpy, durable, these ones jsut dashed my box, one getting through, while machinegunning my turrets...  The next level was it though. the MKIII AA, basically the MKII but does more damage and fires slower. it doesn't produce a flak-cloud like the ould game... Oh and your turret AI is useless with it. It can't aim and hit fighters, meaning i had to manually control it but lsot to fighter spam, that's when i decided i was done.  Don't by the game, Don't gift the game, Don't play the game.  It's broken, very much so, and based on the top reviews, most of which are negative, the devs have little intent to fix it either, with more bugs further in the game.  play the originals, do not play Complete."
262150,Vanguard Princess,Lame versus fighter
262190,Zombeer,this game has beer what more do you want
262210,Last Knight: Rogue Rider Edition,"No-Vysnc Control in game, massive tearing. Ignores CCP forcing vsync, must live with tearing. There is no excuse for somthing so basic missing, and can't find the correct ini file to force vsync. Everyone I tried in the games dir v-sync still gets ignored when set to true.. No excuse for this, esp in a UNREAL based game."
262240,Suguri,Extremely fun and Hard to beat due to high difficulty and unfair hitboxes and yea that's it.
262260,Jets'n'Guns Gold,awesome music - awesome game
262280,Dungeons 2,"'War of the Overworld' is a much better Dungeon Keeper rip off... this is just weird, with slow weird animations... nothing like Dungeon Keeper.  If you've not played DK you might enjoy this as a new experince.."
262300,Tsukumogami,"This game is completely in vietkong language, I don't know what the heck I am reading and clicking..."
262390,Cloudbuilt,"I thought i would love this game, but its pure crap game play. You have to pray to RNGesus just to make sure the game READS YOUR INPUT. is it really to hard to ask a devolper to make a game that doesnt bug out 24/7.   Also love the extreme low res when i have settings at max. thanks alot."
262410,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,Waiting for next discount on the access :D great great game but a little bit expensive for me
262450,Dead Man's Draw,There are many great card games when you can play vs real human. This not that one. Play vs big brained AI all the time and found yourself wasting time.
262470,Rollers of the Realm,Like the concept but way too much dialogue and story for a pinball game.
262490,Manga maker ComiPo!,"Although this program is quite nice for making comics, you can barely use it for any animations. With the base program you can only create GIFs with 32 pictures. The program and it's DLCs are totally overpriced, you can get game development software for the price of comipo. pros : english, 3D adjustments, high quality graphics. cons: the price (if you don't need it dont buy it, or wait for a sale), only a few options for the arms and legs, very hard to visualize characters in motion.  It's not easy to say but. 4/10"
262510,Crimson Room: Decade,  A first look for crimson room decade. Not sure if you would call this an adventure it seems more like a puzzle game to me but the point of the game is you wake up inside a room and you interact with items inside a room to get out of it. Cheap and the story seemed interesting (at least for the first 20 minutes that i played).    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mkVKEltgNA 
262550,Gunman Clive,"This annoyed the hell out of me, purely based on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game-mechanics, of the game-breaking kind. This would only attract the kind of player that loves to face impossible to near-impossible timing-issues.  The game suffers from inability to run fullscreen on PC's with certain GPUs, and can't scale to high resolutions. Nor can it utilize the power of a PC, being developed for tablets and phones I presume.  This can't be recommended, but if you enjoy your job as a Fakir or take pleasure in pain: go for it."
262590,Chuck's Challenge 3D 2020,Great Little Puzzler. Challenging but not frustrating!
262610,Liquid Rhythm,"Conceivably this is a good program but I haven't been able to run it. Emails to the developer go unanswered after 2 weeks. Quite possibly the worst customer support I've encountered in 15 years of computer music production.  I'd love to recommend it, but it does not launch in any capacity on my machine, and the company does not seem to care enough to provide adequate support. Stunningly awful."
262630,Tom vs. The Armies of Hell, Early Access Review
262650,RaySupreme 3D,Update: After the new patch is bugged. 64bit version starts with dll issue. Many many crash. We need more patch and faster fixing. Or its useless! :(
262690,Little Racers STREET,"Very underrated racing game! For a low price you get a nice experience that reminds me a bit of old Need For Speed games (mostly Underground), once you change the camera view from isometric to following the car. You can race in 5 car classes (the higher you get, the bigger the challenge), on numerous tracks utilising same city maps (much like NFS MW), earning money to buy or upgrade cars. It feels very satisfying!"
262750,GoD Factory: Wingmen,"I played the weekend alpha (before it was on steam) when it came out a few years ago. It was the most fun I have ever had in a game like this.   Sadly. when I opened the game today, I saw that I was the only person in the world who was playing. The complete lack of players is depressing..."
262770,Freedom Fall,Simple and cute. Fun concept that is fun to play as well.
262790,Our Darker Purpose,"I wish that I could recommend this game. Much like other twin sticks, such as Binding of Isaac, there is a casual feel to a game which becomes difficult as you make it into the depths.  I liked some aspects of this game such as the level up system. It gives you two options for each level up, giving the illusion of choice. In the end, most of the skills make very little difference in the game. Like one or two of the skills makes a huge difference, but those come around at times when the game seems to know you won't have time to use them. Which is a reason I have to give it a thumbs down.  The boss sequence seems to just be built about prolonging the game. You beat the first chapter boss, only to find that you've been sent back to the menu to restart for a second attempt. You have to beat it a second time to progress to chapter 2. Each chapter sends you back to the start to grind through it again. This was a big downfall for me.   I finally decided to not give a recommendation when playing some of the bosses. Some of the bosses are just ridiculous and tedious (such as the Disciplined King and Cyndar's Timekeeper). There is nothing enjoyable about the boss mechanics. It just becomes how long do you want to dodge before stopping and just finish the fight by taking hits. The second chapter boss literally had me thinking, 'Did the developer just want to see how much ♥♥♥♥ they could put on a screen at once while you're rolling around!?'   Although I finished the game, I would go back and spend the money on something else. It could hold you over until the next big twin-stick game, but there are other games out there that provide better entertainment."
262830,Crimsonland,"This game is an ok Smash TV-alike. But the developer is also active on it and fixed a bug that I reported, so I've got love. Check it out."
262850,The Journey Down: Chapter Two,super cool and super fun waiting on number three i wish the game was longer
262870,Recovery Search and Rescue Simulation ,"Absolute garbage, stutters every 3 seconds, babbys first graphics, walking sim hypetrain, just no"
262900,Smooth Operators,Pretty sure I got this game for a discount but still think after 3 hours I would preferred to have kept my money.  Pros-  Good concept Potential to be a great game  Cons-  Doesn't seem finished Lack of intuitive menu navigation Lack of statistics Lack of adequately optimised game mechanics Lack of human interaction required Lack of depth of options  3/10
262920,Super Chain Crusher Horizon,"Would love to play it since Im a huge shmup fan and it looks fun. Unfortunately the devs decided not only to not include customizable resolution but to lock the game at a high revolution and not bother to let people know they wont be able to play any lower. Im glad I got it cheap in a bundle, not worth the full price if you are on a laptop or a low rez monitor."
262940,Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse,"I was one of the backers for this game, and absolutely was not disappointed!  Broken Sword 5 goes back to the same type of style as 1 and 2, and even allows you to have the classic subtitles and UI, which is a bonus. The art in this game is gorgeous, and George's voice actor returns for another great performance. The game responds very well, which is good for a point &amp; click adventure, I've never had it hang or crash on me either. The game has an autosave feature, too!  The game does a great job of keeping you hooked in the story with all the twists and turns. Just when you and George think you got things figured out - it's not quite what it seems! A fantastic adventure with a very satisfying ending. Hope Revolution will keep this series going, because they've found their footing again for sure!  One tiny little thing, however, is that I don't believe you can actually die in this. Whilst there was a lot of dangerous shenanigans going on, it's impossible to get yourself hurt - which is slightly disappointing as death was a very real danger in previous games of the series. Of course, Broken Sword is no Sierra game - deaths were few and far in between in the series, but it was definitely a missed feature in this game.  Let it be known that Broken Sword 5 is a great example of a success Kickstarter project!"
262980,C-RUSH,Was able to play with 360 controller w/o any problems. OK 2D arcade shooter
2630,Call of Duty 2,the is nice but why is in german? ans why i cant play multiplayer ?
263020,STARWHAL,Nice only one big thing i dislike no multieplayer 
263040,Bot Colony, Early Access Review
263060,Blockstorm,"Gotta say this game is pretty sweet. I love how the environment is so dynamic during game play, it really adds an element of creativity when playing deathmatch.   Key strats: Spam MG Shoot through walls Listen for footsteps  Spam MG Get higher on the map for vantage points Have a steady hand with sniper, one shot one kill! Spam MG Use a camo skin and hide in the trees  Spam MG  but the most useful strat is to just spam the mg, easy mode gg."
263100,9.03m,Yes well... nice.
263120,LUDWIG,"I tried to give this game an honest go, spent 2 hours playing trying to push through the 'tutorial' until I realized that's what the game is like all the way through. The game non-stop bugs you with walls of text every 30 seconds, it seems not quite properly translated to English, the missions are very dull, and both tutorial messages and the characters are incredibly patronizing to the player. I got fed up of it and uninstalled."
263140,Postmortem: one must die (Extended Cut),"I really love the game. It's  like  an RPG in the way you have dialogue choices. There is almost nothing else but talking but...I dig it.  Basically, the game is you are Death (one of, not  the ) and you are assigned to go and take a life at a party. You are assured that it does not matter who you kill but you can talk to them and rind more about each person and the situation they are in, as well as the world. You can base your decisions off that or just pick at random. What they didn't tell you is that your conversations can influence what the survivors do afterwards.  As a result your actions DO have consequences. After you could make the situation in the world worse or improve it based on what you do and who you kill. You get a little wrap up on your impact after you finish your mission in the form of newspaper headlines.  The game does not take long to play so you can try out different things and see the results. I believe this to be a really neat idea. The game is dirt cheap and it offers an interesting idea. It may not hold your attention for long, but I think it's worth playing."
263180,Squirt's Adventure,"This game kicks ♥♥♥. I am not even kidding. The octopus is NOT messing around. He will straight suction-cup-limb you, son. And that crab, losing his eye and rocking that hat and ♥♥♥♥? Come ON. Buy or die, people. This is GTA V how it SHOULD HAVE BEEN. At this rate, I might even let my kid play it."
263200,Signs of Life, Early Access Review
263300,BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger,One of the better alternatives to Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat on the market. Better than Continuum Shift imo.
263320,Saturday Morning RPG,"An enjoyable RPG with a not-so original plot, but with a fun fight mechanic and a cool mix of 2D pixel art in a 3D environment. I was a little sad about how short it was, but nevertheless it was still fun to play."
263340,Continue?9876543210,"The wasted potential of  Continue?  is disappointing but not very surprising. It checks off all the typical mistakes of fresh developers making 'art' games.   Sluggish control during minigames against enemies that can move at any angle. Also, controls can't be remapped.   No option to reset a level in progress. If you end up in an unwinnable situation, you can restart the entire game but not the most recent level.   Core gameplay completely given over to the Random Number Gods.   Ponderous transitional cutscenes that can't be skipped.   Here's some advice to indie developers who aspire to make art through the medium of video games.   If the medium of art is the video game, make the 'game' parts fun and engaging on their own.   No developer has anything so profound to say that players should tolerate poor gameplay just to hear it.   Developers who can't or won't make their gameplay fun should develop a visual novel rather than a video game to make their art.   Finally, the forced analogy between human mortality and software processing is somewhat awkward. Exacerbating this awkwardness are incoherent metaphors to 'lightning', 'prayers', 'storms', and 'shelter' that have nothing to do with computers or software. If developer Jason Oda had simply replaced 'Garbage Collector' with 'Thor, God of Thunder', the result would be otherwise identical."
263360,3089 -- Futuristic Action RPG,Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!  This is a wtf game.    Interface/Menu/Settings
263380,Driftmoon,"This game is fantastic. It is a cheery game that was really good. I wasn't really dissapointed at all, and I hope that the develepor makes more games like it."
263420,Probably Archery,it broke instantly. I wouldn't recommend it.
263460,Girls Like Robots,"Cute puzzle game but the difficulty is not well balanced. Some chapters were quite easy and others I really struggled with. I would have enjoyed this game more overall I'd been allowed to place and switch squares as much as I liked. Call it easy mode if you like but some of the movement restrictions, while I understand were part of the challenge, felt more frustrating than fun. There is a complete walkthrough available which helped keep my puzzle rage in check.   I don't want to give this a negative review as I found it a charming puzzler overall. Just keep in mind that you will probably be reaching for a walkthrough in some sections. And if you're better than me and don't need the help you may find it a little short. I would recommend waiting for a sale to buy this one."
263480,Final Rush,"A great concept that clearly took inspiration from Call of Duty Zombies and the Killing Floor series. Graphics aren't shabby. Gameplay is very bland, guns are unsatisfying and unbalanced. Devs abandoned a few years ago, so don't even bother purchasing. Really wish I could still get a refund, because when it first launched on early access it looked great."
263500,Dragons and Titans,no maybe button; anyways i guess its a good game i just wish i had a way to set the controls to none. the reason for this is i lost my mouse so i went and got joytokey and wanted to use my steelserise controller but the default joystick controls kept getting in the way and whenever i tried to change them so they did nothing..my controller did nothing
263520,Enola,This is gonna be a short but semi in depth review  now for the list of pros  1. Great puzzles  2. Great sound work  3. Great Voice acting  4. Game has a creppy fell to it  5. Great Story  6. Overall Very Fun Game To Play  now for the only main con i run into its not big at all its just me nickpicking  the only con is after a cutsence the game lags for a few secs  I Give this game an 92 / 100  Its a game worth buying
263540,Villagers and Heroes,"I don't get why people say that this game is bad. Sure, it might not have dated graphics, the Cashshop is too expensive. The thing is, you don't need anything from the cashshop. (I bought a Mount for like 9€ to be honest, but i think it supports the developers). If you like grinding, this game might be for you. This game is atleast worth a try!"
263560,Paper Sorcerer,Seems great but hurts my head with a super contrasting colour scheme and lots and lots of dialouge. Also everywhere looks the exact same regardless when you are inside.
263620,Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae,"Why havent i played this before ? This game is amazing ! If you want a beat em up that features mechanics, anime-like style, katanas and tons of mobs to kill then THIS gem is for you. Also note the price !"
263640,CDF Ghostship, Early Access Review
263680,Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta - Episode 1 - Gold Edition,I played the game for 10 minutes. I shot the electric box and the guy teleported into the wall. I was laughing so hard i was crying and coughing. I had to quit the game and write this review. 10/10 I would best $4.99 ever.
263700,Muffin Knight,Please fix the glitch in santa's level bisites that its a great game and ferry adictif sorry im dutch
263740,FootLOL: Epic Soccer League,Is it a bad thing that I like this game?
263760,Turbo Dismount,There just isn't any replay value. It loses it's charm almost immediately and there is no sense of progress. It is also sold for way too much for what it's worth. I do not recommend this game to anybody.  EDIT: Re-review.
263800,Spaceforce Constellations,"couldnt really figure out the game play, and wasnt good enough to keep me in long enough to figure it out. tool tips wasnt that great either to make it a pick up and play type of game."
263820,EvilQuest,Decent budget quality action game.
263860,SPACECOM,"  If you want a 4x type space game that you don't need to learn a whole manual, and you just want to get in and play for a short time instead of knowing you have to invest at least 20+ hours in one scenario, then this is a great quick game to play.  It has quite a few challenging missions that teach you the game, then you can play on an assortment of maps (some will take an hour or more, others could take a few hours). A good game to just get in and start taking over star systems. Computer AI will take back systems that you do not protect so do you leave a few ships behind to protect them or take a chance and use them against an all out attack further up the map. Maybe you have a hinge pin system that you think best to build a battlestation and maybe even a shield but that takes away from how many total ships you can have. Each normal sysem you don't spend the time capturing means one less maximum fleet you can have but there are better systems that provide healing to your fleets (shipyard), or producing raw materials to speed up building more of your fleet.  If the game is on sale and under $3 then you would be crazy not to get it, but if still in doubt then download the demo. Hey, you can even play against your friends and soak up all their tears! MadMyke bought this for me, thank you."
263880,Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender,"Fun fast paced game that challenges you.   Downsides Crashes occasionally. No support for 3440x1440 resolution, it's skews the image."
263920,Zombie Grinder, Early Access Review
263940,Red Baron Pack,"IF YOU PLAYED THIS IS 1990 AND LOVED IT - DONT BUY IT your childhood memories will be soiled  If you want an oldschool plane sim - DON'T BUY IT... this is simply not worth it.  the old version stinks as bad as he original, it was cute back then 26 years ago, controls sucked back then too, but it is just some of he lamest plane controls ever, you can at the max use 2 keyboard keys simultaneously, so either steer 1 way and shoot, steer 2 ways, steer 1 way and change speed. you litterally can not go up, right, shoot at the same time...   2 keys max, if yo press a third, only the first key pressed works... so better remember that if you buy his   and unless you play without taking dmg... you die mission one, over and over coz you crash, get shot down or crash...  the new 3D version is no good either, you can not control the plane at all, for some reason you can not do anything,  there is also nowhere to look up the controls so good luck finding out what to do to fix the issue. even if it was due to controls fat chance you can change those controls  there is a 'Manual' well, a 243 page long PDF full of maps and historical data, but no way of finding out how to do anyhing relevan in the game  The worst part is, the original is 26 years old the 3D version is 18 years old, whoever re-released this had as long as it takes to raise a baby to adulthood to improve this and didn't...  DO NOT - I R E P E A T - DO NOT BUY THIS!"
263960,Wyv and Keep: The Temple of the Lost Idol, Online Multiplayer is Broken
263980,Out There Somewhere,"I purchased this game during a recent sale and paid about 49 cents for it. The game is most definitely worth that price, but I cannot say it is worth the full 2 dollars.   The Good:  1. I always have a soft spot for the pixelated, nostaligic graphics and sounds.  2. The sound track is amazing and does tend to be stuck in ones head after you sit down the controller.  3. The physics and animations were well done, basically perfect.  4. I did like the merger of the side scrollinger shooter and the planetary exploration/platforming. I found them to be very complimentary to one another in this game. 5. Personally, I liked having to avoid the enemies, relying heavily on the telportation gun. I liked the puzzle aspect oft his game, though it was a bit easy.   The bad:  1. The game was too short. My first play through, and not in any particular rush to beat the game, took 40 minutes. this is taking into consideration the time I spent trying to get some of the extra items.  2. The developers said this game was directly inspired by Cave Story and Super Metroid, but I fail to see much of those characteristics in this game. It is possible that I am not looking or thinking hard enough. I expected more weopons, different abilities that would allow you to progress, etc. This game did not feel as atmospheric or epic as metroid and was not long enough to qualify for any kind of story, like Cave Story.  3. The puzzle aspect of this game, while I love it, is wayyyyy too simple. Once you get the hang of the fact that the teleporation gun conserves momentum, you have beaten the game.  4. Not a whole lot of variety. I disagree with the main character when he says that 3 types of beam obstacles are too many. They are not enough.  5. One could argue that this is trying to turn the game into something its not, but: I wanted to see more than one planet. I wanted more intermmediate shooter levels and more planets to explore. I'm not suggesting a re-write, but the simple addition of more content that is already within the bounds of the game engine. 'I'm sorry, but Grigori is on another planet' would have been an accpetable transition between levels.   Overall:  The game felt less than half completed, like a teaser trailer of itself. Imagine the first mario brothers game, on the NES, if the princess was really in the first castle. That is this game.   I think this game could be great if it just expanded on the content a bit. I am not suggesting anything revolutionary. A few more obstacles and perhaps some variety to the planet (or add more than one planet). Achievements do not do it for me and did not add to the game.     For &lt; 1 dollar, this game can be recommended. Not for the full price."
2640,Call of Duty: United Offensive,"Decent FPS from another generation. Works on Windows 10.  Like the original CoD the best missions are part of the Russian campaingn at the end. The bggest drawback is that there seems to be even less of a narratove than the original CoD and instead they throw you into as many set peices as possible.  Don't play on Veteran difficulty. The msot fun is to be had when its played as if you are part of a movie rather than taking the time to peak around every corner, especially since there is infinte spawning of enemies until you move past certain points.  Overall, worth a couple bucks if it goes on sale."
264000,Son of Nor, Early Access Review
264020,Geekbench 3,"Sadly disappointed with buying this for £10.99.  I had (wrongly) assumed that for this money there would be a good selection of features, tools and tests.  There are several FREE utilities out there which offer much greater value for money!  If the developer decides to increase Geekbench 3's capabilities then I will rewrite my review."
264060,Full Bore,"Full Bore is a platformer/ digger with some small puzzle attached, style of game, with very limited low key story attached. The elements of platforming in this game are limited, and do not allow you to jump or try to get where you want as you want. They manged to make a game that is about jumping and digging feel liner in jumping and digging. Your choices in what you can do are already made for you when you enter a area. If you mess up in any way or die its easy to undo it with no consequence, your actions don't matter in any way. With how much depth this game is lacking I found it a bore to play, and while you may not, recommending this game that is going for $15 at time of this review is impossible. If you really want it then at least wait for it to go on sale under $10. Thanks for your time check out other reviews here.  https://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho           YouTube™ Video:  MOB Review: FullBore&nbsp;"
264080,Vangers,"Just an AWESOME Game I wish there was a Remake, (Graphics sometimes DO matter)  Was one of my first games ever and i bought it when i saw it on Steam so i could have it forever and without the problems of installing an old Game on newer Windows.  Vangers got a nice Story, a funny combat style and a lot of different Roads to take on. Its not a Need for Speed or GTA of the modern days but it does not have to. You are the Vanger - Merchant, Slave, Roadster and sometimes a heartless Killer. (Don't worry, you wont be the killer as often as u play that sneaking oneshot archer in Skyrim ^^)  The Story still amazes me, the Characters are well designed and the different Worlds are beautiful.  Today...i long for a remake. With more Maps, more Cars, more Weapons and more of all that amazes me since my childhood.  "
264120,Victory: The Age of Racing,waste of ♥♥♥♥ing time your game is a POS
264140,Pixel Piracy,Sometime I forgot which way I sail. Enjoy the game so far.
264160,WazHack,Oh ♥♥♥♥ I got surprised this game is pretty neat.
264200,One Finger Death Punch,Gave my fingers a good exercise! 90% of doctors hate this game because what it can do to your body!
264220,Mr. Bree+,"This is basically Take a good concept and drag it on way too far: The game.  - There are very few different hazards, far too few to keep 60 levels varied - Several hazards rely more on the player not seeing them than actually being dangerous, making for some quite cheap deaths - The story is pretty unique, but like the levels, it's stretched way too long - Several parts of the story are easy to run past, and they don't respawn if you run back  On the other hand, the graphics are beautiful. And the soundtrack is absolutely stunning, I can't praise it enough.  Instead of buying this game, I recommend buying  the soundtrack  [mattschiffertawstudioentertainment.bandcamp.com] , then playing  the free Mr. Bree - Returning Home  [www.kongregate.com] ."
264240,CONSORTIUM,"A good game, but kind of short if you don't get it on sale."
264260,Global Outbreak: Doomsday Edition,"Global Outbreak is worth buying if you like managing a world in crisis, and don't mind combat that is very repetitive. At 13 dollars and a 10 hour length for the campaign, it definitely has a good price.  Video showing what Global Outbreak is like:(Video was done in early access, but the game is still 99% the same)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgRqelHo_No "
264280,99 Levels To Hell,I bought it for a meme and actually like it in an un-ironic fashion 7.5/10 not bad
264300,Guns'N'Zombies,The ♥♥♥♥ing uninstall button works better than this game.
264320,Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle,"Fun point and click game. The artwork is beautiful and the game overall was pretty enjoyable. There were a few quirks with the puzzles, but it didn't take much out of the game. Some of the comments from the characters are pretty hilarious and allow you to get more tidbits out of the game. I recommend the game, it was very stress free experience and gem of a game!"
264340,Major Mayhem,"If you enjoyed Time Crisis, there's a pretty good chance this game will be right up your bullet-hole ridden street."
264380,Narcissu 1st & 2nd,"It touched my heart, and now it will touch yours."
264400,Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery : Episode 1,"  I haven't finished it but it is a great puzzle game. Akin to Puzzle Agent, this game has tons of little puzzles scattered across the path the discorvering to mysteries. It's a nice game for $5 and it's seems like you get what you pay for (which isn't saying it's bad). I suggest you play this with others, it will make everything better and solving puzzles with your pals 'ish da best'. Thanks to Supreme Nazi Commander Elite for buying me both episodes."
264420,Comicado,Pretty good... could be better though...
264440,Children of Liberty, Early Access Review
264460,A-men,"This game does have its charms and faults, but I decided to give it a thumbs-up because it actually not too bad. If they fixed most of the bugs before releasing it, it could actually have been alot better though."
264540,Platformines,"The game simply gets old fast and becomes much harder at the very end just because why not. I am perfectly fine with games being really hard or having a learning curve, but it feels as though the late game enemies were arbitrarily chosen to have ridiculous damage when you have no more health upgrades."
264560,Quest for Infamy,"I read the reviews that this is similar to Quest for Glory, and bought it for my daughter to play. It is NOT like the quest for Glory games of my childhood. This is best for 12yr old and up.  As an adult - I see where it is amusing, but the analogy others reviewers are making to QfG are a stretch."
264580,Lost Civilization,A visually nice game but I have to agree with the comments about it being 'empty' and too guided. There are no real options and no thinking to do. It's a pleasant enough experience but lacking as a HOG. 5/10.
264690,Coin Crypt,"A fun game to play imo, the one i enjoy the most it the devil character, giving them the damage coins makes me feel good inside."
264710,Subnautica, Early Access Review
264730,Deadly 30,"This game is mediocre at best, and I wouldn't recommend it. First of all, it's pretty boring after an hour of playing - there's nothing to do except for wandering around and killing zombies. There are only five screens and each of them doesn't give you anything new. Since all you need to do is collect parts to buy upgrades there is no point in going further than the screens that are closest to your base. The furthest screens do not offer more loot but contain way more zombies, making returning to the base harder.  The most annoying part for me was getting the achievements. No one told me that all achievements must be completed in a single playthrough and without dying. For example, 50000 parts must be collected at once, and if you die or exit the game the counter is reset to zero, so don't even think about getting these achievements without playing for three hours straight. How the game calculates time that was spent playing is beyond my understanding. I spent more than five hours playing it and I still didn't get the 'Cant Stop Now!' achievement.  The difficulty is very high and becomes higher every night. If you make mistakes customizing your character - well, say hello to 'New game'. Savefiles are overwritten after every night and there is no way to replay certain nights.  The optimization is very bad, the game lags when there are many zombies in one screen, making you accidentally kill yourself and (of course) after dying, as I mentioned, all counters are set to zero.  Considering the fact that this is an amateur game it cannot be criticized harshly, but there are so many typical game design mistakes that you will spent weeks trying to understand how the developers didn't think of some simple tweaks that would make playing 'Deadly 30' much more enjoyable."
26500,Cogs,"I hate slider puzzles, I dont know why I got this game, I knew it would be slider puzzles, but I did it anyways, and I have reaffirmed my hatred for slider puzzles.  come to think about it I probably got this game in the humble indie bundle...  I HATE SLIDER PUZZLES.  then they added a 'fewest moves' and 'lowest time' measure to my slider puzzle hatred, and made it impossible to advance to more slider puzzles unless I exceeded their standard for slider puzzle solving.... I had to efficiently beat slider puzzles to unlock more slider puzzles. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate slider puzzles, you couldn't pay me to go back to this game."
265000,FORCED SHOWDOWN,This game is awesome if:  - you love Skylanders - your favorite character is Bouncer - you never want to play any other character except Bouncer - you love announcers that sound horrible  Please keep downvoting me fanboys
265170,Acceleration of Suguri X-Edition,I don't know how to play this game
265210,Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage,this game is awesome and cheap
265240,Crazy Machines: Golden Gears,"Ugh, this game sucks."
265300,Lords Of The Fallen,From someone who had beat all the Dark souls games ... this game is still fun to play and got pretty graphic.  But i must warm you ... You will encounter annoying bug and if you are unlucky they will be game breaking.  Worth the purchase if on sale.
265330,Gomo,Finished the game in 73 minutes. I only bought the game because it was on sale for €0.49 and not sure it was even worth that. It seems like it was trying very hard to have the charm of something like Machinarium but failed. Its fine but was very bored by the end. Save your money and get something batter.
265380,Grimind,"Conclusion: +Captivating graphics +Good sound design +Good creepy atmosphere +Some good puzzles  -Game mechanics can get relatively tedious -Story is very meh -'Puzzles' that rely too much on platforming  Buy it on a massive sale if you really like indie-puzzle-platformers.  End of conclusion.  I'd start by saying that Grimind is by no means a bad or a terrible game. It's a somewhat interesting indie title, which is clearly not done with a massive amount of money, and I tried not to raise my expectations too high. And I didn't. But it still wasn't that good, and towards the end I just wanted it to end already. And that's not a good sign.  Grimind is supposedly a puzzle platformer, and there are plenty of puzzles indeed. Some are really good, but some are based more on the 'platformer' thingy and the game, meaning that it depends more on you're timing and pressing the right key at the right time, rather than you're puzzle-solving skills. The controls of Grimind were basically alright but not 100% fluid, and this fact together with some level-design decisions made me often get to a point of feeling nervous and irritated as I simply couldn't get through a certain section of the game, again and again and again... Until it stopped being and fun.  I could forgive this, though, but unfortunately there wasn't much to keep me intrigued and motivated to actually want to finish this game, aside for a slight curiosity about how the story would end, and my terrible tendency to finish whatever game I play even if I don't enjoy it.  So, I did finish the game, and unfortunately I didn't reach any satisfying conclusion to the game. Found out the I missed one secret and that finding all the secrets in the game would grant me an additional ending. Went to look for that missing secret, made it to the ending again, and got an even less satisfying conclusion.  Grimind presents you questions and wanderings throughout the entire game but leaves you with no answers, no real conclusion, no real story.  So, unfortunately, awkward story + awkward gameplay equals not such a good experience.  And that's a shame, because Grimind does show potential, there were some entertaining moments, the game had a brilliant sound design which fit the creepy atmosphere, the graphics are very simple and yet captivating, dark and gloomy and yet colorful.  This indie title does have some good features and could be really enjoyable if it only wasn't getting so tedious as the game progresses. It is rather short though, so you could probably get it on a massive sale if you really like this type of things."
265550,Dead Rising 3,"Was decent mindless fun. Wasn't expecting anything more. Than it, out of nowhere, deleted my 15 hours of playing it. All my progress, saves, every ♥♥♥♥ing thing. Seems that this happens to a lot of people. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, man. Any small joy you may get out of this is not worth the frustration. Save your time and money. ♥♥♥♥ Capcom."
265590,The Red Solstice, Early Access Review
265610,Epic Battle Fantasy 4,"Epic battle fantasy 4 was actually the best game I've played all year, hands down. Balanced but challenging gameplay, witty humor and a ton of innuendoes all thrown together into one RPG is a once in a lifetime game. I really enjoyed the strategy to it, especially the weapon and armor system. In EBF4, There isnt such thing as endgame armor or weapons. Its all balanced. The sword you start out with on matt will be useful for some battles, but not all. Likewise, a shiny new sword from a hard dungeon might be great at taking out certain foes, but not much else. The same goes for the games armor. Overall I give it a 10/10, and I highly reccomend it. Easily worth the cheap price tag. To be honest I'd say it worth much more. If you like a fun engaging game with a lot of references and jokes, pick it up!"
265630,Fistful of Frags,A game which you play as a cowbow version of Jason Vorhees
265670,Imagine Me,"i used to be good, but later they updated it, and it got bad. Such a waste"
265690,NaissanceE,Awesome i recommend it but buy it on sale.
265750,Secret Ponchos,"sadly its dead. Good game, but dead. Should be free to play. AVOID."
265770,Cannons Lasers Rockets,"I have a few points to make about this game. 1. Nobody bloody plays it. 2. The controls handle like a car with one wheel. 3. Microtransactions everywhere. 4. No skill required, just shoot. -10/10"
265790,Residue: Final Cut,"Residue has an intriguing setting and concept, but it's not much of a game. Progress is slow and linear with only arrow keys and a space bar to control what passes as gameplay. Controls frequently don't do what you need them to and progress from point A to point B can be torturous. You'll spend the majority of your playtime trying to manipulate the characters into simply progressing forward to where you need them to be. I can't say if it's worth the trouble -- I only lasted about 20 minutes."
265810,The Sandbox,It's kinda tight. God is a naked baby and you play the sand game.
265830,Monochroma,Monochroma is a lovely platformer with great atmosphere.  If you liked 'Limbo' this game you will definitely like Monochroma aswell.
265870,Alpha Kimori™ Episode One ,"I only idled this game for trading cards. Normally I wouldn't review a game that I haven't actually played, but this game has WAY too many positive reviews for something that looks like a cheap RPG Maker ripoff of Secret of Mana."
265890,Hexcells,Amazignly addictive little puzzle game. Totally worth your time and money.
265930,Goat Simulator,"Like Surgeon Simulator, this was another flash in the pan gimmick game that's almost made exclusively for YouTubers to react over and gain a ♥♥♥♥ load of Ad-Sense money on. There is no point to this game. All it is, is just destroy ♥♥♥♥ and 'LOL SO WACKY AND RANDUM'. I hate this kind of comedy in a video game and I could probably do a better game in an Unreal Engine 4 GMod clone. Good thing I only got this dirt cheap in a bundle because I have no clue why anybody would pay full price for this thing. Oh yeah, and I know you people are going to downvote this review to hell because 'You don't get it!' and this has a cult following with an Overwhelming Positive rating, so ♥♥♥♥ you too."
265950,Ether One,"The game is trying to do something, but doesn't do it very well as many others have already done it before and better. I played for about an hour before I noticed it and took a guess at the what the ending would be. A few hours later since the game was very dry and slow with some puzzles only being hard because of silly reasons, I'm looking at the bar on this one, I told myself if I looked up the ending and if it was what I thought it was I'd stop playing. I stopped playing."
265970,Worlds of Magic,This is one of the most enoying Bug factory i have tried and not CLOSE to the old GOOD game. every litle thing takes to long time to load and every battle is a gamble couse the game frezzes or crashes 50% of the time. facing a battle whit low threath indication and you loose if you chose auto combat ...... Wtf how does that even work ? . I think i have reintstalled and tryed playing after every patch but it just keeps getting worse and i gett ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so iam uninstalling it every time. If this was a indevelopmnet game i would fell better about it but what i can see it should be done. (sorry if the english is bad)
265990,Rogue's Tale,"I have died more times than I can count. Now I will go ahead and die some more, dont expect to finish this game if you are a sane person though."
266010,LYNE,This Game is great to just sit down and relax to some music! If you are into games where you have to use you're braincells a little bit this game is perfect for you!
266030,DRAKERZ-Confrontation,What an utterly useless waste of time.
266050,Into the Dark,"So buggy it's unbearable. Constant clipping, enemies glitching, jittery mouse movements, and inability to change any controls in the main menu. Some controls don't even show up in start up menu (such as melee attack); I didn't even know you could melee attack until level 3. Every time you respawn, your character loses some life because the character model gets dropped into the map a few feet above the ground. Sometimes, the cursor would randomly slide downwards or my character would walk backwards without me pressing any buttons. The so-called 'voice acting' is atrocious and there are a lot of times where you must listen to their cringy dialogue and you can't even move around. The graphics look like from 1998 and the gameplay is like from 1994. Don't bother with this one, it is so BAD that it is just simply BAD."
266090,Starlite: Astronaut Rescue,"It's a good short story and definitely not a bad game, And i only wish there was some space for exploration, an open world"
266110,Tower of Guns,One of the best rogue-like FPS's I've ever played
266130,Breach & Clear,"tl;dr Just buy Door Kickers instead. If you really want this game, buy it on mobile, its cheaper and easier to play. Seriously, buy DK or buy the mobile version, this version is flipping $16.99 full price while the mobile version was something in-between $0.99-$3.99 (pretty sure it was $1.99 when I bought it).  This is a port of the mobile version which I also own. I've played the mobile version for countless hours. If there is one thing I dislike about a lot of mobile games is not implementing some form of cloud save. It'd be great if they did and it allowed you to transfer mobile progress over to the Steam version but nah, that doesn't exist and even if it did, screw you, play through the entire game again. The game is basically a 3Dish version of Door Kickers (which I absolutely love btw) but with less freedom in terms of movement, controls, actions, and planning. Its not too bad IMO but its not as great as DK. I think I rated the mobile version as 4 star. Steam version is 2.5 star max. Seriously, don't spend $10.99 on this game. Either get it on sale or buy it on the App Store.   Pros:   - Various Special Forces to choose from all with different stats.  - Weapon customization (at some point during initial release of the mobile version the customization was really good but after a few updates that wasn't really the case).  - You get to choose body armor/uniform. Basically character customization on a fairly basic level.  - Characters Level up individually (i guess that's a good thing?) which allows you to put points into whatever stats you choose for each individual.  - You get to choose what role your characters are (Breacher, Fireteam Leader, etc.)  - The cool top-down to sorta top-down camera switching feature.  - When you watch a replay of your last move you can watch it from the Operator's perspective via over-the-shoulder camera.  -Mobile version requires you to pay real money for 'premium' headgear/face accessories. Steam version? Only in-game cash is required.   Cons:  - If you played the mobile version, well obviously no cloud save/transfer as expect so RIP progress  - Not as much freedom during planning stages  - Something about the character movement doesn't look right to me  - Attachments from initial release (on mobile) have been removed  - Controls aren't that amazing since this is a port of the mobile version.  - THE PRICE! Steam version is flippin' $16.99, meanwhile on mobile it was either $0.99, $1.99, or $3.99. Either way, its cheaper to buy it on mobile.  - It uses a stage-based system if that makes any sense. In DK you can fly through the mission in one swift plan or plan on the go. B&amp;C you get to move a certain distance, and within that distance you plan everything. Once planned, you press the 'breach' button and your guys carry on with it. Once they've all moved, you go back to the planning stage and repeat process.  - The amount of 'steps' you can take is fairly limited and when you have heavier body armor on, it gets limited even further.  - Once you've chosen a class/role for a character, can't switch. I guess that's a bad thing? It is realistic in the sense that you're trained in that role and that is exclusive to you. You decide weather that's bad or good.  All honesty the game isn't that bad but the Steam version at most is a 2.5 star in my books. Mobile version IMO is 3.5-4 star."
266170,Windforge,"This game is fun, and the only bugs I ran into was my screen occasionally having a white bar across the screen.(maybe once every several hours) I'll also note that in the temples after a lot of enemies spawned it slowed down my pc, merely saving and reload fixed this issue, which happend once every temple visit. However, I imagine pc specs play into when the slowdown happens. My specs -&gt; AMD FX-9590 Eight core, 32 GB Ram, Nvidia GTX 970 Graphics card."
266190,Astral Terra, Early Access Review
266210,One Way Heroics,"meh. games decent, good graphics. kinda difficult to figure out what to do. but hey, ive barely played the game."
266230,Last Dream,"Last Dream is just...generic. If it had anything that stood out positively or negatively, this review would be much longer. You know that younger sibling or cousin of yours who tries to imitate a celebrity, only to get the most basic aspects of them down and nothing else, and then when you tell them their impression is inaccurate, they say, 'It's totally spot on!' or something similar? This game is that younger sibling or cousin, and the celebrity it's trying so desperately to imitate is Final Fantasy. Just get a classic Final Fantasy game instead. There's like 6 to choose from."
266250,Procyon,"There are hundreds of games on Steam that play exactly like this one. I've played dozens of them that have been dumped into various super cheap bundles, and none of them are fun, including this one."
266270,Gridiron Solitaire,"I just wasted 4 hours of my life. This game creates a frustating illusion that you can influence the outcome. Well Im here to say you cant, you will lose at least half of the time period... Your not building anything your not creating a team your not doing anything related to football your playing a matching card game. BTW the Big play button is extremely slow reacting with the text and over 70 percent of the time you get stopped. I hate to complain about difficulty but seriously on rookie a guy should be winning alot not losing more than winning.. JUST SAYING.."
266290,Helicopter Simulator 2014: Search and Rescue,REALY GOOD BUT one problem the mouse controuls are inverted please fix please
266310,GameGuru,:) :)
266330,Ethan: Meteor Hunter,"This is a bad game in the most common sense. It starts ok, but its difficulty soon becomes so high it's impossible to enjoy it. I almost finished the first world, and at first the game seemed interesting but the last levels... My god they are horrible. I could have finished them in some time, of course, but the mere thought that this was only the first world made me give up. The precision with which you must make every single step is unbearable."
266370,Calibre 10 Racing Series, Early Access Review
266390,Farm for your Life,This is a perfect game if you're into playing relaxed cozy games. You like farming games? This is for you. You like restaurante games? This is for you. You'd like to like zombie games but they're a bit too scary? This is for you.  Overall it's just an amazing game.
266410,iRacing,"Like sim racing? Love competition?you want the most realistic tracks from nordschleiffe to Le Mans well then look no further than iRacing.  Yes its expensive to start with but this game/sim pays you to play you can earn up to $40 a year just from racing regulary, with this in mind it cost me around $40 a year now for an ever updating evolving sim, you do not get this with many other sims, iv'e been a member for just over 4 years now and I am still not bored of it."
266430,Anarchy Arcade, Early Access Review
266490,Lili: Child of Geos,"I liked the storyline and the visuals alot... but this game is too repetitive and extremely short. The touch and drag style of fighting also does not translate well to the mouse.  I mean, I like this game. I do. So pretty, and cute, and even a neat idea.I just can't recommend it."
266510,Hand of Fate,"If you put action combat in a card game, either do it well or don't do it at all. We have a good and somewhat boring card game with a terrible, awful, uninspired combat sequences. Game throws too many cards at you, too many to care about what they are. And regardless of difficulty (which is easy anyways) you end up drawing cards and playing guess-the-card to win (or loose). A touch of game progression redesign (and maybe even removing combat sequences, or making it scripted, e.g. pc resolving card game outcome in a spectacular scripted fight) and this game would become amazing gem."
266550,Spark Rising, Early Access Review
266840,Age of Mythology: Extended Edition,"Age of Mythology and AOM: The Titans stood the test of time fairly well before the re-release of the extended edition. The graphics were good for a game of its time, but what really satisfied me was the mechanics; it's simple to learn, hard to master. The original and Titans expansion campaigns are well-made and could easily last you over 20 hours, depending on your playstyle and difficulty. Freeplay with bots is good, with AI being fairly strong at higher levels, but not understanding how to cross water very well. There is a scenario editor which I seldom use, but the potential is there to create a custom level/scene.   Now for the extended edition. Multiplayer servers are far from stellar in responsiveness, but they're free, and multiplayer is great fun with friends. The devs added hilarious cheats that are a blast to try out, would highly recommend it. The graphics are enhanced, but it's nothing to go crazy over. I found this had a much better feel than AOE II, but was still similar (if that's your kind of game). I would recommend this game on sale."
266940,Alex Hunter - Lord of the Mind,I have played a ton of these hidden object games and this has to be the laziest one to date. Sadly this is one of the few HOG games I have every given a thumbs down. I find a lot wrong with this game and they annoy me to no end. The worst offender was a chalkboard puzzle that the game refused to auto solve for me. Grrrrr really?? Click on the hint button and it tells you to look in the journal and I just never did get the crummy drawing. I had to go to youtube and see how exactly they wanted me to connect the dots.  Their is a walkthru for the game that is contained on the two feet in the lower right hand corner. I found it by accident another annoyance. The timer is sllllloooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww its just slow. I just didnt care for this game. The story didnt grab me. Some women comes in and your off to solve the case.  The graphics while they look good they never did draw me in to want to play more of this world they created.   The problem is that the bar is set very high for these types of games. This one just feels very lazy compared to other games that I have played. House of 1000 doors is a lot better and has a better story to boot. Nearwood is another great game.   I am skipping this one. Just cannot be bothered. Feels like work instead of fun. Spend your hard earned dollars on some other more deserving hog. This one sadly is just weak sauce.
266980,The Labyrinth of Time,"It took me quite a while to decide whether or not I'd recommend this game. I like it, let's be clear on that, but I love this type of game in general, so that is certainly affecting my judgement. But many other games do this better, and this game engages in some prime sins of bad point and click adventures.  Pros:  Gorgeous artwork Nicely varied locations Decent puzzles Good music  Cons:  Counter intuitive control scheme Repetitive Mazes No settings access  Sins:  1. Looking at an object should never result in the message 'Nothing Happens.' Everything you look at should have a description, and if you're looking at something that was never programmed to be looked at, the message should at least say something more like 'This isn't anything important.' 2. You can work yourself to points where you are stuck, but not dead. This shouldn't happen in this type of game. You should always be able to progress, or, if you can't, see that the game has ended. 3. There are many items which you can pick up which serve no purpose in the game. If they do, and I just don't see it, then I apologize, ignore this complaint, and in small doses this is okay, but during the course of the game there were more items in my inventory which I did not use than those that I did.  4. There is not much to do compared to the amount of area you can cover. I've gone through huge mazes that had nothing important inside them (for example, the hedge maze) and may as well have been one room. it doesn't encourage the type of exploration a player will want to take part in.  Verdict: If you're REALLY jonesing for a stroll through the adventure games of the 90s, get it. it's cheap. I got it on sale, when it was REALLY cheap, and for the price, it was worth it. If you want a good point and click game from the 90s though, I could better recommend:  Myst Lighthouse Shivers The Journeyman Project Series  Check those out first, they're all a lot more fun, if you can get your hands on them."
267060,Gravity Badgers,"Unoriginal slingshot game with objects that push or pull the projectile and portals that teleport it around all so you can collect three stars and get to the end. A $1 phone game that has the gall to be on pc and charge $5, and only a single looping 30 second track that will drive you up the wall."
267220,Line Of Defense Tactics - Tactical Advantage,"For this price, I really expected a more sophisticated game. Instead, it's less deep and well thought out than other mobile games I paid five dollars for. The story is not very developed, actions have very little motivation, and the whole thing just feel disjointed. It seems more like a coffee break game, in bite size. And even at the current 50% off it is way over priced."
267340,Beware Planet Earth,A nice little jem of a tower defense game. Much more depth to it then shows in the screenshots! One of my classic favorite games now. Closer to 8 or 9 hours play time. Rest was computer idling.
267360,MURI,"The game itself is well made, featuring old-school graphics and sound design. If you're looking for the nostalgic early 90's DOS era, you'll feel right at home.  However, in my humble opinion, it doesn't feel like it has a good gameplay for today's standards. It's hard to say -exactly- what is wrong about this title. The gravity, the airborne controls, they FEEL wrong. Anyone expecting a game with kind of a 'modern' quality gameplay with old school graphics, I think you should avoid it. Some game types requires a good story, some others require good graphics, this one requires good gameplay and in that aspect it kinda crushed my expectations. That's the reason I'm not recommending this game, as I think that this kind of game requires perfect gameplay controls for a good experience."
267490,Batman™: Arkham Origins Blackgate - Deluxe Edition,"  Static camera angles make moving around difficult. Combat is not smooth like the other Batman games where it gets confused as to which target to attack, and if it should block. And on that combat, I've realized it is 2D, so it auto targets the wrong person constantly."
267530,The LEGO® Movie - Videogame,"If you've played a Lego game made by TT Games, you've pretty much played this before."
267600,Airport Simulator 2014,  Me and my friend challenged each other to gift a game we think the other person isn't going to enjoy. Needless to say we both lost.
267610,Woodcutter Simulator 2013,Do I Recommend This Game You Ask........Hell Motha ♥♥♥♥ing Nawl I dont recommend this ♥♥♥♥. This isnt Wood Cutter Sim 2013...this is Stare at Tree Simulator 2016. Graphics remind me of Tetris 1991 Edition on Max Settings. You spawn in and try to look around but find out you cant because you have to right click to turn your fat ♥♥♥ neck. Imsick and tired of this. You can even cut down a tree because you get the 'Your not in the right position' error over and over. You have to cut the 'marked tree' I didnt know you cant cut specific tree. This is Racist Tree Simulator 2025. Someone please tell me how to refund a steam game.
267670,Realms of Arkania 1 - Blade of Destiny Classic,Way too oldschool. Feels boring and lacks action.
267730,Ground Pounders,It only took a few minutes to see that none of the normal conventions apply and the learning curve is more than I want to invest .
267750,Shadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown,"I've been psyched to play this game from when I first heard a dev team was working on this. It was a dream come true! I remember anxiously waiting for 2 years for a multiplayer shadowrun. I been a long time fan of shadowrun since i first discovered it during the 90's. Naturally everything I say will be positive of anything shadowrun related.   This game however had a bad first impression as people began flooding into the servers on full public release. The dev team could not fortell how badly people have been wanting to play this, and thier servers could not handle the strain of so many people flooding in. Which made the game hub very laggy and unreliable.   The graphics are not on par with most big title games, but visuals never mattered to much to me. And today you could probably get on and find the servers almost barren save for the average shadowrun fanboy/girl. the skills are not perfectly balanced but its still fun to try different character builds out. it lacks any character interaction with the story other than the end where they let the players take a global survey which choice will be canon in the next installment.   I still like to get on and try to make a meager existence in the boston lockdown, so see you in the shadows chummer!"
267900,Guilty Gear Isuka,  I received this game as a gift so I would be expected to complain less but I still will. Pros -Good representitive of the genre. -Good attack moves. -There is a okay choice of characters. -Visuals are pretty good for the time this was made. -Soundtrack! Cons -Hard to use without a controller. -There are better games of a similar price range. -Locations aren't great. -A lot of cards required to make a badge.  Side note I installed this thing 3 times and unistalled it also 3 times because I know this is a decent game but it just can't be played without a controller.
267920,Gun Metal,Loved this game back in the day. This is an underrated game.   The only downside is that you'll have to tweak the controls and settings before it works. The campaign should last between 2 and 3 hours.   Great game.
267940,Glacier 3: The Meltdown,"  Graphics are truely amazing, Its a real challenge! I"
267960,Hyper Fighters,  stellar gameplay  
267980,Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising,THATS MY GAME :)
26800,Braid,One of my favorite games of all time: an art puzzle platformer.
268050,The Evil Within,"The Evil Within feels like a mix of Resident Evil with Silent Hill monsters. What I like in this game is the stealth system. You can stealth kills certain enemies from behind to conserve ammo. The difficulty is challenging, but the hardest difficulty is just very frustating. (You need to unlock it first) Some things I don't like are the quick events which goes like this: If you don't know what the devs want you to do in a certain time frame you will die. So in order to learn how to survive you need to die first.   Good:"
268200,Antisquad,There are many squad based tactical games available today. This one got lots of humor and a nice stylized art style. After giving it a twirl I never found myself drawn into it. Rather I stumbled around with the clunky crafting and all the premium hooks.
268220,Meltdown,"Played this game with my friend in stretches of a couple years. Like a day or two in a row every couple months. Then one day playing it suddenly had a realization that this isn't a game, it's just mobile game mechanics with decent graphics and edgy hip music. There isn't a game here. Just get it for the mechanics or be smart and don't get it.  Wait I wanna be funny ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ trump cancer memes, I want to die"
268240,Mechanic Escape,"Mechanic Escape was a game that I got in a giveaway from IndieGala. At first I was doubtful it would be anything near high quality, but it was Okay saying it was free. I would not pay 5 pounds for this game as I feel the content is repetitive and somewhat boring. It is very rage inducing, and is similar to Super Meat Boy (Just not as good). It has an average concept; but I think that they should develop at least some kind of story as to why he's running round like a headless chicken looking for mechanical parts.  Good Things- Interesting Concept. Enjoyable   Bad Things- Repetitive Rage Inducing No Storyline. Boring."
268260,Let's Sing,"DONT BUY! Its not karaoke, you just hear the song recordings with the artists singing loudly. NO instrumental tracks, NO effects added to your voice. Save the money, play a youtube video with subtitles, its basically the same thing."

268340,High Strangeness,"1. Too Short 2. The cats voice gets worse 3. Would become supreme leader of creepy shadow cultists from the hood again 4. Nothing can satiate my lust for power, except those pesky crystal skulls 5. I could've beaten those enemies right before the jail compound, no problem, easy 6. Why can't you marry the chick from the record store.... 7. Plot twist that no one expected VERY SURPRISING, VERY ORIGINAL (mars does actually contain life, thx jacob) 8. Sumerian Epics, Watercolors, and something about pink floyd 9. Too many cut scenes, not enough secrets, a little too linear 10. ^SPOILERS ABOVE^  How i got here  C H E A P  D I N O S A U R S "
268360,Krautscape,"Great to play with friends. I wish people played online more though. One thing the dev could add is while you are queing for online play you can play with a bot in different gamemodes.  Btw the best gamemode is ping pong, the others are kind of broken."
268400,Panzer Corps,"Very very simple turn based strategy . With nothing new to it.  It starts straight away with idiotic concept. You units on map represents regiments.. heheh but for example there was no panzer 2 unit only, or one type of AA/Arty/Ship/Plane. IDIOTIC.    Game for 15 year olds and lower. It gets boring very quickly. At least its not ugly 3d graphics. "
268420,Aura Kingdom,Don't play this game if u are not active or u would get banned like me just bcz of inactive ???? wtf is this. just 16 days cuz i study . u want me everyday keep play this game and ignore the life fk no! yeah this game are too op but the management are the worst i ever play! w8 another company or other server to c8 this game and i would play it if have free time  Warning  Play everyday or banned if want play on this server!
268500,XCOM 2,"I got more then my money out of it, plus I own all of the DLC it offers. Yet, the game can be very frustrating at times because it uses an artificial suspense system that keeps interjecting forced decision-making throughout instead of letting that happen by itself. I guess that's because the game play isn't dynamic enough on it's own. A lot of the missions will also have a time limit imposed on them to again generate artifcal excitment or to put pressure on your decision-making. Thus, why the whole experience always feels forced and fakey.  I don't think the AI is clever enough on it's own to challenge a human, so they limit your choices and cramp your decision-making with frustrating time constraints. I logout from this game more times then not, pi##ed-off!"
268520,Orc Attack: Flatulent Rebellion,It just won't start. Don't buy it!
268540,The Whispered World Special Edition,"In general, I really like this game. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times to figure out the different solutions, but it all is solvable, given a bit of thinking and a few hours of try and error.  Where it gets to me is the part where the solution is a random sliding puzzle. I have no problem with try and error, but a sliding game that's just sliding tiles around for hours on end... That for me was a real game-killer. Every other puzzle was fashioned in a way that you could get it done either with a bit of leg work or exploring a bit more to look for the stuff you missed. But this sliding ♥♥♥♥♥.. After looking at the same plate for just 5 minutes, I was allready tired of trying to solve that part. And it's randomized as well, so every game presents a unique solution to this.  I like puzzles, but I don't fancy spending my spare time sliding around tiles, possibly for hours and hours..  On that basis alone, it kind of ruined the rest of the otherwise brilliant game for me."

268710,Zero Point,"WARNING: Problems if your computer isn't a recently built gaming system  Zero Point will not sync video and audio if your computer cannot run the video decoding at the full 75fps.   If the decoding is not fast enough, the audio will keep running at full speed while the video feed slows down to the speed your computer can decode and display the video. This results in the audio getting ahead of the video. When the Audio finishes, the video freezes, so you will not ge to the end of the show :-(  The show is very good. However, I wanted to post this warning so that buyers were properly informed of the limitations.  PS: Recommendation is a 'Yes' if you have a fast computer."
268750,Magicite,"Game breaking glitch-- Cannot clear the game.   The final boss, after beating him, crashes the application. This has happened 5 times in a row, and as well for a friend.   If you look through the discussions, there are many that have the same issue. And.. I don't see it being addressed. So...fun game, but unbeatable due to programming bugs."
268810,Paranormal State: Poison Spring Collector's Edition,"At first I kept playing the game because it seemed so bad with the expressionless faces and bad voice acting that I just wanted to see how bad it might get. In the end, though, the mix of hidden object and puzzle solving (along with a very useful hint system) actually managed to keep me engaged and entertained. And you gotta admit, the location artwork is fantastic. But I would only pick this up if I were a big fan of HO games."
268850,EVGA Precision X1,"Installed latest version of this application as I just got an EVGA GTX 1050 ti sc (which I love, by the way). Since the card idles at 23 degrees and doesn't really go above the high 50s under full load, there's defnitely some room to mess with overclocking. Anyway, I installed &amp; ran this program (knowing about it from previous versions but only just now using Steam to obtain it) and it crashes immediately. I tried running it 5 times. Each time it crashed within seconds of opening, before I could do anything. I then uninstalled it and installed the stand-alone version which I obtained from EVGA's website. That too crashes immediately in the same fashion. A cursory search of the internets seems to suggest that the GTX 1050 ti sc may not be supported by this application (along with other 10 series cards). This, frankly, is BS. Please update this application so that it actually runs &amp; functions. I'm using Windows 10 x64, by the way. If and when this app functions without crashing (at least to a reasonable degree) I will change my review to reflect that."
268870,Satellite Reign,"I wanted the game to be good, I found it to mediocre at lauch. I figured it was my old crappy pc and forgot about it. Now that Ive build a more high-end machine I thought Id play it again. The experience didnt really change; low framerates and bugs are still ruining the experience.  If you are starved for a syndicate fix grab the originals they will provide a lot more fun for your cash, this will leave you sad and dissapointed for what could have been."
268890,Masters of the World,"I like this game i really do, but it funny to know that i cant even play it for over 2 minutes with out it crashing. Its just to the point where i have to warn others about this game!!!!   This game has a great basic and god knows it could be in the $60 ~ $70 range to this day if it was maintained (regular managment, getting back with complains, solutions to solve crashes, fixing crashes, and all that jazz) point blank the basic requirements for releasing a game.  *****NOTE: This game doesn't work the same for everyone different computers have different results - even still there will be crashes it just differs wether the crash is a majorly bad on or not.  *****NOTE FOR DEVS (dout you'll see this): This game has the potintal to go places, make a but load of money, or whatever your reason for making it - Basiclly fixing what has been broken will bring more people more people = more money, more money = creation in next of series, and Creation in next of series = more buyers than previous game = MORE MONEY AND FAN BASS FOR ANYTHING ELSE YOU COULD PUBLISH!!!!! Also you should know that releasing a defective product like this is asking for one of us american to sue you, because that one of the thing we do best......  *****LOVE THE GAME - NOW START ON THE WORK have a good day/night/whatever =)"

26900,Crayon Physics Deluxe,Fun game that takes me back to my childhood. My little one loves it too. Beautifully crafted soundtrack as well.
269010,Science Girls,It's a very slow start. Tons of grinding. I don't even know why they bothered with a story or artwork.  Gotta find them donuts.
269030,The Yawhg,"I find this shallow but a great proof of what could be done. I bring it to parties all the time and 4 players at a time get to have a great short roleplaying game, only issue is after a handful or two of playthroughs you will see events you have seen before."
269050,Year Walk,  Playing through this game was a very interesting experience to say the least. The story was captivating while the visual art/music kept you immersed in the world and folklore. Make sure to play through twice to get the real ending!
269110,Super Motherload,Why on earth would you not make this game co-op online?
269150,Luxuria Superbia,"Luxuria Superbia is…well, I’m honestly not sure what kind of game it is. My first thought upon playing it was, “What is this, Oviduct Racing Simulator?”. The gameplay itself is a sexual innuendo.  I have no idea who this game would appeal to. Most of the positive reviews seem to like the strangeness of it, but is that its sole draw? Not my cup of tea. "
269210,Hero Siege,"Very interesting game that caught my eye and I bought it. Played it and I was confused AF, so then I realised it was kinda like a binding of issac deal so after you get the swing of things its a really simple and enjoyable game to play"
269230,Aces Wild: Manic Brawling Action!,Absolutely blastastic!
269250,WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.01,boring
269270,LOVE,"IF IT'S ON SALE, then you might wanna pick up Love. I got this for about $1, and it's totally worth getting for that price if you want an extremely simple, no-nonsense platformer with spot-on controls. No boring tutorials, no tedious story, just pits and spikes and you jumping carefully over all of them. Being able to manually place checkpoints wherever you want (at the cost of some score) is a great idea too.  However, unless you're really into speedrunning and practicing for flawless playthroughs, you won't be playing this one for long. I beat the main game twice, as well as the Remix Mode, and it all took me less than 45 minutes.  So yeah, a streamlined good time, but it absolutely doesn't last."
269290,liteCam Game: 100 FPS Game Capture,Its good for what i got it for the money that it ammounts to but it could be better quality. I still love it and will still use it for clips i want to record.
269310,Infectonator : Survivors, Early Access Review
269330,Chronology,This game is a quick but clever little puzzle platformer. I enjoyed how both the inventor and snail time mechanics played into each other. It is a fun little game that is definitely worth a playthrough!

269370,Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman,Nice one ....
269430,Burning Cars,"While the game supports 4K resolution, the developer never tested it, the common 'undersampling' of the screen area means you can only move the mouse in the top left hand corner. This makes the game menus impossible to negotiate - basically the game is unplayable."
269470,MorphVOX Pro 4 - Voice Changer,"The audio quality is choppy, and it hardly even works. I was expecting a better product for $40."

269650,Dex,A potentially decent cyberpunk story gatekept by clunky combat mechanics and obscure or non-existent choices.
269670,BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition,The background art is really nice and fascinating. What a shame that the actual game takes place not there but in a black silhouetted foreground. The gameplay seems enjoyably simple at first but soon becomes frustrating in it's lack of precision. Maybe this was a decent phone game but I wouldn't bother on PC.
269690,RymdResa,"I honestly have no idea what the draw here is, for me. Perhaps it's the fact that it only requires the mouse to control the ship. That leaves a hand free for beer. Yeah...  First thing, there's absolutely no Pew Pew for you. None of the player ships have weapons, to my knowledge. This doesn't necessarily take away from the game - but it would have been nice to fire back at some of the infrequent enemy ships.  Other than that, it's a 2-D exploration game with semi-newtonian physics. Most of the dangers involve avoiding suns, and various bits of debris. All the while there's a kind of relaxed randomness to the environment.  For the stat heads and RPG folks, there's a bit of ship customization and a wide range of items for such.  I managed to beat it, not 100%, in under 10 hours. So yeah... it's a short game if you just want to plow through it. If you're a completionist, I would imagine this game has at least 30 hours of play in it.   Not a bad buy, if you want a weird semi-casual game."
269730,The Golf Club,December 2016. I recommend waiting till it's on sale for $15 or less. In that sense I recommend it.  PROS:  It's kinda fun if you have enough patience to get decent at the swing mechanics and can overlook the cons.  Graphics are adequate I suppose.  It's one of the best of the bad selection of golf games on steam.  It has course creation.  Probably fun with friends.  CONS:  Sometimes green lines lie!

269770,Secrets of Grindea, Early Access Review
269790,DreadOut,"Ever since the first demo was released about 3 years ago from now I planned to ignore DreadOut completely. I was never a huge fan of Fatal Frame, but always had respect for that series trying to keep some of it's identity and some of the core of the classic survival horror concepts, instead of devolving into a simplistic jumpscare fest. Which DreadOut is. I suspected it after the demo. And now, after deciding to give it a try (I mean, they supported the game for so long and even made a standalone expansion, there HAS to be something?), I can say that with certainty.  DreadOut, from the very beginning, until *almost* very end is the same kind of game most horror themed products on Unity engine, ever since SCP and Slender games got popular, is - a linear jumpscare fest of BOO in your face moments with loud screaming. It has the most basic of mechanics, quite clumsily taken from Fatal Frame, sometimes has 'puzzles' and sometimes even has an item you need to take. So exciting! But most of the time it's very guided experience that holds exactly on one thing - on trying to be spoopy, because freaky ghost, baby. But butsin doesn't make you feel good here. Because it's barely a mechanic, unlike the complex system in Fatal Frame. It's here just to give an illusion of another mechanical layer and make sure you have first person view with limited visibility to do jump scares more effectively.  The only good things the game has are, amazingly, in the very very end - there's one actually pretty interesting in concept (but boring in reality) boss fight, another good in concept, but more frustrating than hard boss fight and actually good with visuals and some concepts final boss fight, which is, however, terrible mechanically. It actually feels as if the developers finally realised how games could be made right as they were finishing it. Shame they didn't scrap the entire game and make a new one, though.  Is DreadOut worth it? Well, if you're playing horror themed games just for spoops and video/streaming scarecam silliness, you will be able to get some enjoyment out of this. If you want anything more than have jumpscares at different intervals... Hell, if you want the game to perform and not glitch, you better look elseware. It's not like there's a shortage of horror themed games on PC lately."
269810,Spate,"Like a hybrid of Limbo and Dear Esther completely gone wrong. This is a sheer abomination with laughable gamplay, trying-too-hard atmosphere and poor dialogue."
269890,AR-K,"Skip. Harkens back to the very worst of the 'click everything on everything' era of adventure gaming. The controls/interface are an unintuitive mess. You have to revisit locations and click items that you've already clicked before, with no cues that they'll behave differentlythis time. Plentiful typos in what is a sometimes confounding translation. The storyline is gibberish. They've also managed to come up with adventure history's most relentlessly unlikeable protagonists--I think we're supposed to think she's 'cool,' but she's just a sarcastic jerk who makes terrible life decisions, then blurts them out to total strangers. Even the voice-acting is obnoxious. Game is just not good."
269990,Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars,"A fantastic and enjoyable roguelike with a lot of replayability. Easy to learn, hard to master. Definitely deserves some wiki love."
2700,RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum!,"This game, which has (terrible) visuals that any potato should be able to run, has trouble keeping up even on the lowest settings on my rig that's more than sufficient for most any other game. It stutters and stalls in response to the most basic commands, making what should be a fun game a frustrating chore to play. All because I have an AMD graphics card with the latest driver. I don't want to have to roll back my freaking drivers every time I want to play this game, ffs.  It's incredibly disappointing. I really like this game, I've racked hundreds of hours in it just dicking around in free mode, but now it's pretty much unplayable. I can't even believe I'm saying this, but don't bother unless your rig is equipped with an NVidia card. Just get the first two, they're better anyways."
27000,The Path,"Slow and boring.  Everything is slower than it should be. This starts when the game first begins and you watch an unskippable 30 second opening sequence (repeated every time you restart). After that it's similar to The Stanly Parable (tells you to do something while implying something else) except the world is huge and devoid of content. It took me 10 minutes to find the first memory and 30 more minutes to find the wolf. In between, you literally run through a forest for most of the game.  But even for a game about running through a forest it lacks. The controls are clunky. You can't look around using your mouse, the longer you sprint the worse your view gets, speed is painfully slow and turning is a nightmare. At certain points the camera angle changes and you become even worse off.  But then there's the story. It sucks. Each girl (this isn't told to you while playing) requires you to find a collection of memories and a wolf. The wolf represents a situation where the girl fell to temptation and lost their innocense. Memories and hidden rooms help you peice together how it happened. Its not obvious how you interact with some things (I've left wolves mid-sequence because I didn't know I was supposed to wait), and the stories are simple and boring (see tale of tales wiki to read them and save some time)."
270010,Time Rifters,this game was AMAZING so much fun i loved it i even played it as a party game one person puts on the oculus rift plays then swaps it off its some AMAZING fun with friends not too expesnive either and even a workshop!...but it no longer supports the new sdk for oculus rift so you can no longer play it in the oculus rift so its worthless to me now because it was a game for the oculus not a game just to play in my spare time. a shame really a solid 10/10 to a 3/10
270050,Quest of Dungeons,"Lets face it. This is a pre-teen roguelike rpg game, a great introduction into genre. Simple mechanics and plenty of stuff to collect, kids love it. For more experianced its undemanding mind-off resting game from heavier titles.  As said, this is good place to start your journey into dungeon crawlers, rpg and roguealikes."
270070,The Girl and the Robot,"While I do like the game in theory, I ran into a number of issues. There's falling damage, where if you jump from a slightly higher spot to a lower spot, you risk killing yourself. And wrestling with the camera sucked out a lot of my interest in it. The camera was slow, sticky, and would only follow on its own if you were running. Overall, I think it's a charming game that would have been made much better if the camera followed you automatically."
270090,N.P.P.D. RUSH - The milk of Ultra violet,"This is a very strange game to say the least,never got very far due to it being,in my opinion,boring.Probably wont ever come back to it"
270110,Block Story,"Its not a great game, Its like they tried to add extra mods to minecraft."
270130,The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed,"A splendid departure from the typical wave shooter format, and a nice narrative in its own right. I do wish it was a little longer, as I finished it in roughly two hours, but that's just the nature of episodic games. All in all, highly recommended for those who like exploring and solving puzzles."
270150,RUNNING WITH RIFLES,"Great game. Easy to learn, hard to master."
270170,Depression Quest,"I attempted playing this game months ago and couldn't get myself to read through the first few pages. I ended up throwing in the towel. After a friend of mine suggested this game to me, I made my way back.   This is a game that you have to give a fighting chance to. It has a rough start, but once you get into it, you realize how important it is. It allows you to view depression from the perspective of someone suffering. It's an eye opener.   If you enjoy reading and can stand to read a short novel- you'll really enjoy this. It's a bit depressing, hence the title, but it's a good story that keeps you engaged."
270190,1Heart,"Horrororiented puzzle/adventure game. I found the game rather challenging, especially since it was quite often hard to figure out what was next (alot of it just seemed illogical to me - and too many times the objective was hidden in the graphical representation of the game).  If you like very hard adventure games with a horror-theme, this could be for you.. otherwise there are, in my opinion, many other games out there I would recommend over this one."
27020,The Graveyard,"This is not a game. The 'story' itself takes just a couple of minutes and all you do is walk with an old lady through a graveyard, to sit on a bench, hear a song and then die... or you could pass away even before reaching the bench. I've given less money for fantastic games. I'd go as far to say that this is just scam."
270210,Melody's Escape,"It's basically what I would expect from a flash game or a mobile game. Even Vector, a FREE mobile game (of the same theme) is better than this. If you really want to get it, get it on sale"
270230,Prominence,"Straight out of the eighties. Keeps all the clumsy parts of old point 'n clicks but none of the charm. Dull sound design and empty, uninspiring environments. Did we really wait years for this?"
270270,Frozen State,Excellent graphics. Excellent crafting and exploration. It does get a bit repetitive per block and structure. Alos a few glitches; like the pc portal at my base becoming airborne. I could no longer continue with the mission.
270310,Dominique Pamplemousse,This game is my new religion.
270330,Ku: Shroud of the Morrigan,"Couldn't stand playing for more than about 10 minutes of this game. The first 5 minutes I've noticed some bugs like the steam pipes which were supposed to throwback your character, could be walked above without throwing the PC. Also the animations are badly made, like half of the frames were missing.  The movement is clunky, the dialogs are silly and from the little time I've played, seemed that this game was supposed to be something like Bastion, but it doesn't get any close.  I was sad when I played it because I was following this one since greenlight and I had good expectations. Too bad the game looks like it's unfinished and its features aren't well implemented, like the glove thing. Could be more fluid but it's a pain to control it.  "
270430,Cypress Inheritance: The Beginning,oculus rift support mid 2014 nearly 2016 payed money off steam for that reason
270450,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,"  My Friend bought me this game which was so kind of him, so here's a review on the game :P  The Game doesn't take much to run. It will run at around 40fps lowest, and around 400fps at max, really. The Soundtrack is one of the best ever, and very catchy, I guess.  The game is quite easy to get a grasp of, and once you've played for half-an-hour you'll be a pro :P You can play with friends, Singleplayer, Local play. It would be fun to play with friends (Haven't tried it yet) but singleplayer is good enought for now, and provides good entertainment :D You should definately give this game a try, even if you won't play it too much."
270490,The Forest of Doom,Nice little story.
27050,FATALE,Don't EVER buy this... I don't mind the lack of interactivity as usually the story or environments make up for it. Sadly in this case there was neither there to make it a worthwhile purchase.   This has to be one of the worst experiences that I've ever had to the displeasure of interacting with. The visuals are neither pretty or interesting. The story is pretty much non-existant. There's some poorly rendered words that appear on screen as an attempt to give some context but instead is confusing. The only interactivity in the game was a strange candle section where you had to light them all. I don't know what the significance was but it was awkward to navigate and not at all enjoyable.  Please don't waste your money on this. Even if it goes on sale. Stay away. It's really not worth it.
270510,EPOCH,Too expensive for the content. Still a nice little game. Would recommend if on a sale. Just a linear 3rd person shooter. Good against boredom. 5/10
270550,Yet Another Zombie Defense,It's a zombie survival game so as many other it have no story. The graphics are great. The gameplay and controles are good. The soundtrack is just perfect hyped fast tempo at night and sad at day. The multyplayer mode works smoothly without any problems. It's pretty fun to play with your friends so why not giving it a try.
270570,Reversion - The Escape,"Not bad. Short but sweet, almost makes me want to play the sequal"
270590,Long Night,"Oh hey lady! Wait don't kill me!  (Also, where are those 2 episodes??!) [I know, they closed down]  + : great artwork, ok sounds, playable graphics (not great tho), weird story, gamepad supp  - : it will never be finished, camera stupid af, sometimes buggy, bad controls  Buy at your OWN RISK! 2.5/10 would ask the killer lady out again (died 100% worth it) [nah lol run away]"
270630,Haunt the House: Terrortown,"This game has really outstanding audiovisuals - it reminds me two of my favorite Double Fine's games: Psychonauts and The Cave. Hence, art-wise, it would rank it 10/10.  However, game-wise - which, unfortunately, is the most important point of view here - it just doesn't play well. Gameplay is somewhat chaotic, there's really no information about how to scare people effectively, and it is just repetitive. Achievements here are also a weak point - they are almost exactly the same for each level, demanding just to interact with every single item possible in every available way.  I am really sad to post a negative review here. Especially that few years ago I have played flash version of this game - which included only Mansion level - and rated it 5 out of 5 on Kongregate. I think that what was a good idea for an original flash game just doesn't seemto work very well for a little bigger standalone game."
270750,Realms of Arkania 2 - Star Trail Classic,Waste of money
270760,Realms of Arkania 3 - Shadows over Riva Classic,"Wow, terribly crude &amp; dreadfull playability. Extremely primitive, dull boring. Just downright awful. What a waste of money, amazing something this bad is actually being sold on steam, Zero out of ten."
270770,Etherlords,I got 4 menu clicks in. What a ride. Crashed so hard that I had to reboot my computer because there was no amount of closing/alt-f4/task manager that could handle it.
270790,Etherlords II,"An All Time Clashic!   After so many years of its creation, I still come back to this game for a kind of unique experience. Its similar as good as playing Magic the Gathering, but with many features making it different from a traditional card game. The turn-base abilities are actually like playing cards of MoM, there is the deck-building aspect that I consider mandatory for these kind of games, and there are artifacts you can trigger in a turn etc. The variety of cards is as needed to maintain interest, and since I played this game also before getting the steam version, I have gladly finished two of the races campains twice. The AI, one of the most important aspects in this kind of games, is 'clever' and challenging, even if at some point a specific enemy could be strongly specialised to one kind of attack-approach.   Even if the game is really old, the visuals are not at all annoyingly audated. Dont expect fabulous light effects etc, but the graphics are still pleasant to the aye, and not a big deal at games like this in any case.  The original CD version allowed for LAN multiplayer, and Steam version allows for multiplayer via a loby. Note that the loby is actually empty-abandoned, so you need to phonecall a friend so the both of you get in the loby to multiplay. But even if multiplayer is now harder to achieve, single play experience definetly worths the money on this game. I had and still will have many-many hours of fun with Etherlords II.   Definately recommended from my end!"
270810,Jones On Fire,"I bought this game beacause the witcher II gived me a 20% sale off ticket, and it was fun in the very begining. But there is a only way to play this game.Just keep running and avoiding all stupid slumber or fire or more annoying slumber. I have to admit cats are really nice and the sound effects are cute.But it's just too easy and I get really tiered about this. But there are the achivements I can not give up.I have to keep palying. It's really painful to collecte the cat, beacause you only can collecte 5000 cats and 50 golden cats in around(maybe just beacause I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I can only collecte this.I don't know.). But if you wanna get the achivements.Trust me, It will take you a lot of time.   And I don't know, have this company concidered to put this in ipad?  This game is too time wasting:("
270830,Global ATC Simulator,"This is a great ATC simulator in the since of it’s user friendly interface and is so easy to set up. You can just enjoy the simulator as is. But unlike ATC2 and ATCpro, it does not have voice control. This would be the best ATC simulator if it were only equipped with VC. So you get pretty bored after a few hours because you are continually typing commands, rather than just saying it. So for the price of this Simulator (which is ridicules) I would not recommend buying it. Rather save up and go buy ATCpro or ATC2 which is more advanced and provides what EVERYONE wants, voice recognition."
270850,Car Mechanic Simulator 2014,"I attempted to run this game on my Mac but the screen froze every time at the loading screen. I know CMS 2015 is quite a fun game, so I would give it the benefit of the doubt, but that relies on my being able to have played the game in the first place. (I also had the same issue with CMS 2015 regarding the screen freezing)."
270880,American Truck Simulator,I love this game a lot!!!!! I can't stop playing it!!!! I would recommend this game to anyone!!!!!!!
270950,Ski Region Simulator,"This game is made by the makers of Farming Simulator, so I thought I would love it. But there really isn't a whole lot to do in this game. Its mostly just grooming the hills, which consists of driving a machine up and down, up and down, and up and down again. This is basically all you do, plus plow some snow once in a while. Even though it was cheap, I would say its (in my case) $10.99 out the window"
2710,Act of War: Direct Action,"Singleplayer is OK, multiplayer on the other hand is very unbalanced. Once the AI finds you they will attack nonstop until their wallet is empty and after that they will do nothing. Yes, you can be out of money very easily if you spend on wrong stuff or if you cant capture enough oil fields. Every game feels like capture the oil fields because that is the AIs main goal, you are secondary. The US army has fun and useful units, the other two factions are useless nd boring. There are too many steps until you can actually start making useful units which is very boring. There isnt enough maps and not enough modes ad youcant change settings either."
271240,Offworld Trading Company,"If you have no technical issues with the software, great, it may be an enjoyable game. If you do have technical issues, good luck getting support. My three posts in the support forum (starting from about a month ago) have been met with complete silence - not even a 'we can't help you'. Looks like Sorenson &amp; company have taken the money and run, leaving behind an abandoned piece of software."
271360,Industry Giant 2,"I have more than a thousand games and never have I had a problem with a game that most of people having technical troubles with. Well, this game is the first game I came across that my computer was not able to run. The game simply crashes at launch. The developers don't seem to care so buy it at your own risk."
271370,Transport Giant,"don't buy it. seriously, just DON'T BUY IT.  first at all : I LOVE THIS GAME. spent countless hours, hundreds of them, dozen nights playin' the TG GOLD. really, really love it. and i still love this game. so i was happy to see it at 2 eur and smth on sale. took it right away, start playing it. and the sad truth is that is not worthy of your time. why?  - FLICKERING. despite what the devs might say, the flikering is unbearable. no way you can play it without headaches after 15 minutes. the devs are claiming that they fixed the issue, but on my GTX 750i video card, it is driving me crazy. at almost each other second, flickering. almost black screens. it was impossible to support it, no matter how much i've tried to ignore it. - FREEZING. it's almost dying and unresponsive to anything. after 1 minute or so it starts to do whatever you've clicked when it was frozen. also a mood killer like the flickering. - TG Config is not working. i've tried to modify it for larger resources, and is not working. which is also killing the game because on logs/forestry/planks you have very limited resources and once they're gone, they' re gone for good. I was never able to modify the forestry, but i wanted larger mines. nope, no matter what i've changed in the config, the game uses what he wants. so, sorry, but this is not what I WANT.  - LOW FP RATE. like in none. on larger resolution, yeah, is nice to see a big part of the map so you can plan your transport and so on. but nothing is moving. NOTHING.   so.. i am trully sorry to say NO. DO NOT BUY IT. DO NOT TRY IT EVEN FOR FREE. if you care of your eyes and time.  until at least the flickering issue is solved for good, no way in hell i am gonna play this one again.  and this is too bad because, despite ancient graphics, i still consider this one better than the new launched Transport Fever ( which is a shameless rip off of TG )."
271500,Sniper Art of Victory,"I play csgo on 32 tick servers, this is better than csgo."
271550,Tribloos 2,Dood little game for casual gaming
271570,Space Farmers,"I thought that this was actually a fantastic game. I will say, however, that I wasn't able to complete it as I originally intended, as an online co-op experience. A friend and I completed a handful of levels, but then the lag between us became excessive. We play other games together fairly regularly, so I felt that this is likely an issue with the game itself. We only finished the game after meeting each other in person. The other issues include a strange mission-selection system that forces you to replay levels you have already beaten to unlock additional content, and a laser turret segment that is next to impossible with standard mouse sensitivity. However, with all that being said, very few games are well-designed from the ground up to be cooperative experiences like this one. On some occasions one player will unlock walkways for the other, one player may have mines and the other a detonator, or one may be able to see certain enemies or obstacles that do not appear on the other's screen. All of these require coordination and communication to execute. However, the soundtrack is totally goofy and may need an overhaul."
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,good game. i cannot play online for some reason. whe i select my character the game closes
271640,Humanity Asset,"This game is bad. It's riddled with bugs and issues. It seems like an unfinished game or an early beta.  I got through the training level and halfway through level 1 before it crashed. The game crashes every time you click outside of the game window. Such as my other monitor… It wasn't worth continuing besides idling it for cards and then deleting.  I'll just list off some things I noticed:  +The framerate is uncapped and had to force VSYNC on so I wasn't running at 500+fps +You can't slide from a standstill, you must be moving first. +Level design is horrible +Dialog is very amateurish +$10 asking price is insane.    1/10  Terrible "
271670,10 Second Ninja,"I really enjoyed this game! If you like speedrunning, you'll buy this game. Hurry! You're 10 seconds are almost up!"
271730,Light,"While the core loop is fun, the game is very simplistic in design, audiovisuals, and narrative alike, and the levels suffer from a number of rookie mistakes in level and game design. There are better stealth games out there, but if you want one that cuts to the core, and you can live with its janks, Light may be worth a try anyway."
271760,Dungeon Lords Steam Edition,"played it last about 6 years ago great game to play with friends over LAN and now that it is on steam over the internet. Also pro tip save often game is still unstable and can randomly crash. Also if your playing multiplayer the host has all save data so when you hit load char and it says lvl 1 dont be scared, if you save the game in multiplayer that is only so that you can host the same savefile as well."
271820,Card City Nights,the game leaves a warm fuzzy feeling inside with a nicely built atmosphere but many aspects fall short of which the most prominent is the fun in actual game play. it may be worth a try but I cannot bring myself to progress in the game.
271860,Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection,i am a fan of unique and diffrent and this game is a bullethell with a twist. math. if your really good at match you'll have no problem with this game but if you're not you are gonna grow to hate this game really quick. there are a few issues with this game first is making math a key. it's so diffrent in modern society that it could actually kinda throw you off a bit because you would think they are just power ups for your multiplyer and wont pay much attention to it. but in reality its numbers multiplication and additional that's it so far. the game is overall an ok game the soundtrack is pretty awesome but the gameplay is lackluster at best. don't go into this game expecting something big and for the price they want for it on the steam sale i would say at regular price it's worth 3 at best but for what it's worth on the steam sale i say go for it but don't expect a lot from this game. overall i say 2 out of 5
271900,Hexcells Plus,"  You might be wondering if Hexcells Plus is worth getting if you've played the original Hexcells and found it a bit short - it is. It took me about 6x as long, in fact.  The original almost feels like a demo compared to this one; it doesn't reach the full potential of Hexcells, in my opinion. So, you're really doing yourself and the game a disservice by not getting Plus."
271920,Worlds Adrift Island Creator,My computer dose not work for it but it's probably cool
271970,Hero and Daughter+,Great game for those who love the thrill of a good grind and the doozens of possibilities from creating your own unique party. With dozens of girls to choose from and tons of growth potential from each character it really can get crazy. My only complaint would hav to be the random crashes that occur from time to time. With that in mind still a great game to play.
271990,Dreamscape,"OK, I have to admit that I was fully prepared to hate this game. It came in a bundle, and the description made me cringe. I went through every other game and decided I would give it a try. Turns out, I'm glad I did.   This is the only game I have ever been tempted to play through a second time! Mechanics are easy to follow like most RPG maker games. Money isn't wasted on constantly buying potions etc because of the drop system. Story and characters are a blast! It took me roughly 17 hours to play through, so definitely worth the bundle price I paid for it. If you like Aldorlea Games, you won't be disappointed in this one."
2720,ThreadSpace: Hyperbol,"This is how 'abilities' should work in a game, none of this lock on insta hit spam spells or +12 damage aura garbage. Every skill has to aimed or placed in position, creating many tactical possiblities. Plenty of weapons/defenses with upgrades, if someone just spams hyberbols at you there are plenty of ways to bounce them back into thier face. Best space tank game ever made. But you shouldn't buy it since theres no one left to play against."
27200,Summer Athletics,I want a refund because the game was fun but after a couple day all of the events didnt work like when I tried any jump events the keys would not work. So You all need to fix it.
272010,Aveyond 3-1: Lord of Twilight,even tho its a small part of the full game I really enjoy playing it.. I really love all aveyond games soo much ;u; &lt;3 I really would love it if aveyond 1 and 2 also comes to steam &lt;3 I would love to keep it in my liberary *0*
272040,KAMI,"Not gonna lie, I loved this game. It's a great, relaxing little puzzler. Good way to spend a few minutes here-and-there figuring out the paper arrangement. Definately worth buying for the price."
272060,Serena,"A surreal experience, a twisty little treat."
272270,Torment: Tides of Numenera, Early Access Review
272330,Shadow Blade: Reload, Early Access Review
272470,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II,"I guess I must be doing something wrong. Playing on normal as an arcane mechanic and I am dying left and right. Sometimes I stand in the middle of a lage mob, and nothing happens to my health. Then all of a sudden it drops to zero in one second.  There is a ton of skills and it is unclear to me what benefit one over the other has. Reskilling was cheap, but I can't see any difference between a lvl 10 flame thrower or lvl 10 spider.  Item drops are boring as I seldomly find something that is better than I already have equipped.  I could also do without the soldier mini game, read mission description, read 4 comments by your commanders, guess buest commander, click send."
272600,Detective Grimoire,"In the interest of full disclosure, I got this game during the winter Steam sale for $1.39. To be honest, I think it definitely is worth full price but I am happy that I got this game basically at a steal.  To start off, I love the game's art style. It's got an almost storybook charm to its setting and world that I can't help but fawn over. The cuteness translates over to certain mechanics like making the titular detective draw out what he thinks is happening in his notebook complete with snarky little word bubbles like “I have a stupid nickname” to add character. The voice actors are great and if you're familiar with internet voice actors you might recognize Detective Grimoire's voice actor from the old Trapped series of flash games and the voice actor for Agent Folder from literally anything Arin Hanson has done. The actual mystery is pretty interesting but if you're anything like me, you'll call who did the murder right away. Regardless, I still really liked how suspenseful the story was and even though the actual murder didn't get me the side story does. I'm being intentionally vague here so as to not spoil anybody.  My only real issue is a mechanical one. In the beginning of the game there's a feature where you can switch to “walk mode” and go to different areas. I like the idea because I can examine everything I want without having to worry about clicking on a way out accidentally. However, a little under half way through the game, I had unlocked all the areas and was using the map feature to fast travel from place to place. I think the only times I even clicked on the walk mode button again were misclicks. While I understand why it was there in the beginning of the game, I think the walk mode mechanic was ultimately useless and I think unlocking areas could have been done slightly better.   Aside from a very VERY minor complaint I really enjoyed this game. The characters were fun and interesting, the voice acting was great, the story was engaging, and the art style is lovely. I heartily recommend this game full price or no! I eagerly await a Detective Grimoire sequel! In case the developers are reading this, I have a title for you. 2 Detective 2 Grimoire!"
272890,Vertiginous Golf,"  Could not get into this game. I found myself bored trying to enjoy it but then again I was never into golf games, so."
272990,GAUGE,"I'm genuinely confused by the positive reviews, because there's nothing appealing or fun about this game. It just gives you a headache and nothing more. I guess you would enjoy this if you're completely f***ed in the head.  On top of that, the developer is just a sh*t person in general. His attitude sucks. The amount of people who actually support this game and/or developer is actual insanity."
273030,Pro Rugby Manager 2015,"If you paid full whack for this game I understand your disapointment. For me personally though, paid just over £1 for this game so can really complain much. It's basically just copy and paste from pro rugby manager 2 which was by no means perfect back in the day but I enjoy this. Yes it's miles (or even galaxies) away from the more polished management games but for just over £1 it makes me smile."

273500,Over 9000 Zombies!,   This review is created for   My Curation Page.  
273600,Descent: Freespace - The Great War,"Absolutely terrible. I read everywhere that this is on par with Freelancer, but in fact it is nowhere near. I'll take a good story over graphics any day, but this is just unplayable, especially due to the poor controls. Should be free to be honest... even then I wouldn't bother."
273620,Freespace 2,"Nice game BUT the age is really starting to show off. This game was released more then 10 years ago and if you are looking for a nice game with many details this is not it. But if you are one of these '90s' kids that played this game when you were young i can recommend you to do it, bring back the memories. Making this game start is also a pain. So in conclusion, no don't buy this if you are after something good, buy this for the 'old game' feel."
273730,Driving School Simulator,"An awful, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Horrid damage, and just not that good graphics."
273740,Extreme Roads USA,"The best way to describe this game is Big Rigs between the first two patches, because you have collision with AI and guard rails and /some/ of the buildings. You can easily drive through forests without the branches even trying to stop you, you can drive through solid buildings, you can drive through water... okay, hold on. Imagine thick woods, with squirrels playing, deer prancing, and a truck made out of tinfoil staring menacingly from the shadows. That's this game.  This game is worth it for a laugh and that's it; I spent $2 on a bundle with this game and it was KIND OF worth it.  Also the game uses up 2 cores and 3GB of RAM because it's a leaky mess, runs in debug mode for some reason, and on top of that, will begin to drop frames and stutter. Considering what others said, I had it run okay, considering it didn't crash."
273750,Formula Truck 2013,"This game is amazing, in every aspect, sure a few years old but the physics, the sound, the graphics, and of course Gameplay are all fantastic. This game is so optimized and well made that i am able to run it on my AMD Radeon intetgrated laptop graphics card on my HP AIO at 30-40fps. The boys @ Reiza Studios are now my heros!! :)"
273760,Towtruck Simulator 2015,"Hahaha They had to add loud music to the trailer to hide the fact that theres no in-game sounds whatsoever! Also, This game is awful When you play it at least 4 times, Then go into the game and drive out of the station It crashes. This game is not worth 11$"

273830,Aviator - Bush Pilot,"This Guy here copied my original review I guess he has copied quite a few other people all his reviews are from other People I guess he just likes pretending to be with the cool guys.  http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteveSK/recommended/273830/  I think this could be a nice little game it takes a little while to figure out the controls, really nice frame rate (50-60) good graphics for what it is. play it a little bit before you judge it. this was my original review up here.  This is Very High Graphics 3620x2263 Resolution just over 40 FPS        this screenshot very high graphics 3620 x 2263 resolution I think it says over 40 FPS wow&nbsp;"

273890,Arctic Trucker Simulator,"i only have hazy memoies of watching ice road truckers on the history channel years ago, but the fact that some old canadian trucking veteran has endorsed this no-budget simulator made by a bunch of germans is hilarious to me.  at least this game is optimized compared to extreme roads usa. that game runs like a mud fetishist going through a bog."

27400,Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble!,"I originally bought this game when I was in college, directly from Mousechief. Years (and 3 laptops) later, I found it again on Steam. I was so excited! This is such an adorable game, and while it can get repetitive, it's certainly worth a playthrough. It's beautifully designed, has fun characters, and an interesting story. If it's on sale, I'd definitely recommend trying it!"
274010,Ship Simulator: Maritime Search and Rescue,"I like the sim but can't work the throttles or wheel without the cursers. They either are full on or full off for the throttles or hard right or hard left for the wheel, and the mouse is not the best way to manouver in tight quarters. Maybe I'm missing something but because of this I'm not sure it rates a thumbs up."
274130,Rambo The Video Game,"Rambo got his face beat with an ugly stick. If you loved playing time crisis on your ps2 back in the day, then dont buy this. At least not for anything above $5.99. There hasn't been 1 word from the devs since launch back in February, meaning the game will never get updated ever. the action really isn't that bad. Enjoyable in a point and click kind of way. Would be better played on a tv with a light gun, except there are too many controls to accomodate a light gun, and light guns aren't supported. This would have been great on consoles in 2004. In 2014 on pc it's SH!T    Edit April 2016: So by now the game is only 12.99 regular price and has a few extra levels free of charge. I'd reccomend picking it up on sale to anyone looking for a few hours of mindless fun."
274170,Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number,"Overall, it pales in comparison to the first game.   Hotline Miami  mostly took place in tight corridors and was focused on melee combat, there were firearms but they were more limited and the placement of enemies with guns was far more deliberate so that it added challenge without being faux difficult.    Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number  however has a lot of large open levels with the majority of the enemies having guns, so a lot of the time I ended up being shot from off screen. This meant a lot of the time I was playing far more cautiously because I couldn't run through the levels quickly like the first game and trying new strategies for getting big combos. Because of the randomness of the gun enemies I kind of just went from room to room hoping the enemies would be in the right position so I wouldn't get shot, so overall it was less fun than the first game where you could get very precise. It was very annoying being shot through a window because an enemy had moved there when you fired a gun and in the last death he wasn't there. The first game was challenging but it was also fairer, because it felt like when I died it was my own mistake in mistiming, whereas in the second game I often died because I got shot by an enemy off screen had shot me, often through a window and I had no way of knowing they were there. The large level design doesn't help that I get shot from off screen and enemies can you see. Its just really cheap compared to the first.  The storyline also felt was misguided in that it overexplains things that happen in the first game and was too easy to follow. I liked how the first game was simple in the plot and the second game adds a lot of characters and lore that I felt didn't really work with the first game. The ending was cool though.  However the music and aesthetic are just as good and you can still have some fun with it at times. Its not a bad game, its just overshadowed by the first in a lot of ways. If would only recommend it to fans of the first game who want more levels, for anybody else I would say just play the first one."

274230,RONIN,"A simple and quick game that is fun for its ingenuity and style. Don't buy this for the story, there is none. Buy it for the gameplay, which consists of some stealth, and lots of dodging bullets."
274250,OlliOlli,"Game looks great, good concept, music is ok, controller compatible.  Terrible controls! Maybe some of you feel fine with them but I just don't get it. It took me so many tries just to finish the tutorial and I'm not having fun at all."
274270,NOT A HERO,"This game was not half that bad but it was sort of lacking.  Pros:  - Colourfulness  - Good feeling of that sense of victory  - Quirkiness   - DLC: You get to play BunnyLord  Cons:  - Low amount of levels.  - Really quick levels (if you are just aiming to complete the objective)  - Really long levels (if you are aiming to complete objective plus side objectives)  (alot of the time I was searching for some missing item/creature to get the extra stars which defeats the purpose of it being fast-paced)   - DLC: Only 3 levels and pretty easy.   I got NOT A HERO: GLOBAL MEGALORD EDITION for $4.99. Is it worth its original price: $19.99? No. Is it worth $4.99? If you enjoy a quick and colourful game, Yes."
274290,Gods Will Be Watching,Interesting game but just not for me. Excellent art style but overall frustrating levels that require alot of trial and error and frustration. The levels sometimes drag along for a bit.
274310,Always Sometimes Monsters,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The interface is super cheap and buggy (e.g. forcing you to open the general menu to access your inventory, or being unable to get a proper full screen mode), the game makes a big deal of 'life choices' but is actually painfully linear, and the mini quests are beyond boring. I gave up after a few hours, even though I had high hopes for this game."
274350,Dropsy,"I loved this game! I came in thinking it was goin to be creepy and crazy, but it ended up being a real sweet adventure filled with hugs, kindness, and adorable animal companions. Some of the puzzles were tough to figure out, but I was able to beat it without a guide, so props to the developer for giving the players the tools to solve it's puzzles without making the solutions truely out there. I also didn't expect such a nice twist ending. It didn't come completely out of left field either, so it was honestly a believable ending given all of the information you come across during the game. The music for this game was especially well made as well! Very relaxing adventure that wasn't afraid to get depressing and creepy at the perfect times. I look forward to hopefully seeing what the developer makes next~"
274480,Drox Operative,"Drox Operative can be described as an Action RPG. It has all the elements of an action rpg, for example you have a character(ship) who has attributes that both increase the overall stats of the ships in obvious categories, such as damage, or speed, and which allows you to equip the items you loot from the dead, provided you reach the minimum level in the required stat. The items you collect from the vanquished correlate in many ways with the types of items you would find in an average RPG sporting a normal human(or whatever) character. You have weapons and armour. However, the ship nature of your main character quickly makes its presence known because you have alot of item types which you will not usually find in an average RPG sporting a humanoid.  An Action RPG, but not as we know it  You quickly need to become accustomed to a range of items such as power plants, crew, thrusters, computers, shields(of the energy and regenerating kind), cargo bays, batteries etc. It's not difficult to come to grips with, it will just be quite unfamiliar for a while. The range of items is relatively small when you first start, but the variety builds up over time, so that you can make a ship built of quite an interesting set of equipped items. The flexibility comes from that fact that the item slots in your ship are only limited by the size class of the item. So you have light, medium and heavy components. And you can fill up those heavy components with any heavy components you want. Obviously some things are essential, but it’s not like you specifically need gauntlets of strength to complete your build. If you can’t find those Gauntlets of Strength, just put on another Helmet of Strength, or 6 helmets (you know what I mean). As the item diversity increases you will find that that Heavy component power plant you absolutely needed might be able to be switched with a medium component solar panel, and some other heavy component switched in. Though I will say here, while this sounds great, you will be very limited in terms of choice in the early game. And by early game, I mean the first 20 to 30 levels.   Manipulating the Galaxy for fun and profit  The game goes further away from the mould in its most distinctive feature, which is its constantly moving universe. The typical Action RPG has a level of random built into it. While it has its specific quests and overall story and backgrounds, the enemies are probably selected randomly from a selection of enemy types for the area.   Drox Operative has no specific story or quests. It is a simulation of sorts, whereby a randomly generated galaxy will be built, and a selection of the possible aliencivs will be placed around that galaxy. The aliencivs will then start playing their 4X game, or in other words, they will start building their empires by exploring the galaxy for planets, building colonies and ships, possibly building alliances and killing each other. You are but one ship, but you are very powerful in comparison to one ship of an alien civ. You won’t be singlehandedly destroying large civilisations, but your help can certainly turn the tide.  The quests you receive will depend on what the alienciv currently wants or needs, based on the random elements which make up the galaxy. So quests can be generated by war, where each side will ask you to help kill the other side. Or quests can be created because a plague has spread across a planet.  To be fair, the actual task of the quests won’t set the world on fire. They are usually something like buy this item from this planet and take it to this planet. Or kill 4 of this enemy. Or kill this enemy until you find enough of these parts. The two part that differ are that you won’t get the same quest every game, and the results of the quests are not predetermined. The first point, that you won’t get the same quests is pretty obviously explained at this point, but here I will explain the result not being predetermined in better detail. Of course the completion of a quest will result in such and such experience points and such and such money being gained, but it also affect relation points. You will gain relation points with an alienciv. But this also means you lose relation points with an alienciv that hates them. The aliencivs have relations with each other as well. So you may see aliencivs that don’t really like each other coming to like each other because they are both at war with the same enemy. And they like seeing the other civilisation killing their enemy.   I didn’t mention this before, but the enemy ships are also a faction of sorts, the level of faction similarity depending on whether you have the expansion. Without the expansion, the various monsters fight each other and the alienciv, they grow stronger by winning, they build various installations and make raids on the alienciv. This opens up another set of quests, which become more important as the game goes on, as the aliencivs need these various menaces taken care of. And if you(or the alienciv) does not destroy them early, they will become more powerful over time. With the expansion, the monster ships can also colonise planets and become another alienciv vying for control.  Win or lose? It’s how you play the game!  There are five ways to win and three ways to lose. You can progress towards multiple win states at the same time, but some win states are somewhat detrimental to getting other win states. Your every action can contribute to one or another win state. They can also contribute to a lose state. For example, if you are trying to be diplomatic and get everybody to ally up with you, you may end up provoking one alienciv while trying to gain the favour of another. You may end up with a win, but you may have had to kill off a number of aliencivs to accomplish it. And killing aliencivs doesn’t help with you legend status, though it certainly helps the galaxy fear you. And while it may seem that a military win, where you just have to be allied to the last surviving race, is easy, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. You can pick an ally, but end up losing them. And you will find yourself the only one left in the galaxy with that bitter enemy you fought tooth and nail to kill. You may be still alive, but your conquest of the sector has failed, and you will need to move on.  The randomness can be highly customised by the player at the creation of the galaxy, with many features and elements able to be turned on or off. You will be creating many galaxies, because you will probably win or lose a galaxy in a few hours at max.   I recommend Drox Operative. It has some polish issues, but it is certainly very unique, and worth perservering with. Also, it has online coop, and I assume that is fun. I certainly recommend trying out the demo if Drox Operative sounds interesting."
274500,Brigador: Up-Armored Edition,"Brigador (a.k.a Robot Warcrimes Simulator 2016) is an amazing game. You'll pick one of many different vehicles (mechs, tanks, Mad Max-style bikes, anti-gravitation vehicles, oh and a A TOWER-SIZED ROBOT MADE OUT OF CARS AND GUNS etc.) and arm it with two guns and a defensive system out of a really big and diverse arsenal, and proceed to warcrime your way through the city of Solo Nobre.  The game supports a variety of playstyles - scoot and shoot, stealth mofo, big strong independent robot that don't need no cover and MAXIMUM CIVILIAN WARCRIMES MODE, among others. While there's a campaign mode, where every mission (basically one big puzzle) can be tackled with four different loadouts, the real meat of the game is Freelance mode, in which you'll spend your hard-earned cash to buy new pilots, mechs and warcrime devic- I mean, weapons, to tackle a succession of up to 29 maps in a row.   The beautifully-crafted environment is fully destructible which means you will literally and figuratively make your own path through every scenario. Brigador's graphical and gameplay deparment aren't the only standouts - the writing is excellent and the music is really effin' good.  Did I mention the devs are still putting out free content and helping the community mod their game EVEN THOUGH the game did poorly at launch and had next to no media coverage? Yeah, these dudes rock.  Anyways, I hope you'll give this game a chance. It's got one heck of a skill ceiling if you're interested in a challenge, and it's got plenty of stompy robots stomping around if you just want to turn off your brain and channel your inner robot-loving sociopath for a bit."

274880,Jet Car Stunts,"The game is fun and simple and a great car speed game to play quickly, i made a video playing the game so here is some gameplay :)   https://youtu.be/KbB9tQiPZEI "
274900,Murder Miners,"  I got this game for free - I was lucky.  Intially I really liked this game. The idea of combining Halo and Minecraft was cool. The execution wasn't. What I got was what looked like a really lazy game.   What is there to like about this game? Quite a lot, actually. What's there to hate? More then there is to love.  Firstly, the art style. Graphicly the game isn't much, and that's supposed to be the draw. It's supposed to look like Minecraft. But the thing is, it's doesn't have that charm that minecraft has. That consistency. Certain block textures look really great and textured, while others look plastic and plain. In a way, I feel like the minecraft style was chosen because the devs were too lazy to actually make a unique art style for the game. The player models look glitchey and strange shape wise and texture wise. There was much to like about map design, either.  Next up, the community. The community is dead. No one plays the game anymore, and if they do, they either hack or won't legitimently play. It's difficult to find a real server. As a matter of fact, it's difficult to find a server at all.   Finally, gameplay. This is the only saving point of the game. The gameplay is straight forward and simple, but hard to master. Each weapon is pretty unique, but some of them are unbalanced. (For example, a battle rifle vs a pistol.) Combat was essentially halo, but added lots of other factors like parkour and strafing. In the end I liked it, but not enough to get me engaged. I played the game a few times when I wanted to burn some spare time. Maybe it's me as I've never been a halo guy, but I didn't enjoy the game enough to invest time in it. I didn't want to get better and climb the leaderboard.  I understand that this game is an indie game, and for indie devs, I applaud their success. I also understand this is an old game, but it was released for steam in 2014. The developers could've at least remastered it for a PC port.  I  will  be giving murder miners another chance. But for now, here is my first impression."
274920,FaceRig,"Great fun to use and very easy to get up and running, Love It!"
274940,Depth,good luck have fin
274980,Influent,"As a vocab primer, it's fun. My Spanish is OK but I never knew the word for stapler... until now!  As a tool for actually learning the language, it's useless. You can wander around someone's house and tell them how to say 'light switch', but then when they ask you about literally anything outside the home, you won't even know how to say 'what?'  While this is a nice idea for immersive learning, and it's fairly well put together, it's really not the 'Language Learning Game' that it advertises as, because language learning is about so much more than vocabulary. Put it this way: in the Spanish version, it's optional whether or not to include noun genders. You can't learn Spanish without knowing the gender system. So it doesn't teach you the language. It teaches you some words. That's it.  Get DuoLingo if you are a beginner. It's free and a million times better."
275060,Alone in the Dark: Illumination,"I didn't totally believe the bad reviews so I bought this game on sale, and now I do belive them. As I write this, I'm already planning a refund. The game is simply not fun, not scary, lots of stuff to fetch so it also feels like a chore. The physics are awful, you can tell this just by the melee and jump action... I'm so not playing this."
275080,Post Master ,A neat indie-game that is somewhat easy to learn but lacks stuff like sorting terminals and overnight logistics. Kind of fun to play. Recomended as it is cheap :)
275100,Shelter 2,"Shelter 2 is an open world survival game where you play as a lynx raising her four cubs. The game encourages you to explore with it's vast open world. The art style is gorgeous and sound design relaxing. Saying that I never really found the survival aspect of this game particularly challenging. The lynx mechanics are fun, but repetitive, and for those with a short attention span, this may not be the cat simulator for you.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEM8sgVJ1kk "
275180,Costume Quest 2,"Starting this game I was immediately skeptical. The first Costume Quest held a special place in my heart. It's sequel had a lot to live up to.   From the get-go I was not impressed. The game's storyline seemed loaded, time-travel - really? Despite the graphics retaining their similarity with the original there was a lot of added 'detail', it felt cluttered. To top it all off the fighting mechanics had changed. From playing the original to this in a short span of time, the altered fighting style was jarring and uncomfortable.   But the costumed kids had provided me such joy in the past, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and stuck with it.  After some groaning and grousing. Some frowning and some grumbling. The storyline began to unfold. Familiar faces resurfaced and a smile was gracing my lips. The world you explored had deepened, the hidden bonuses for exploring were genuinely rewarding. The battle system, especially as it expanded became just as enjoyable, if not more enjoyable than the original.   By the end I was thoroughly satisfied! The antagonist was a great blend of bizarre and entertaining and entirely appropriate for the game's Halloween-themed setting and the cotumes were, as always, fantastic to see in battle-form. (Of particular note was Jefferson's 'Declaration of Destruction.') The strengths and weaknesses mechanic was also a nice detail and the ability to upgrade your costumes, which in turn, changed their appearance, was kind of awesome.   Unfortunately, the game felt much easier this time around. Much more forgiving, especially later on in the game. The water fountains were never an issue, as you could eat candy on-the-go to keep your health in check. I didn't use the cards a single time, only after I had finished the game to farm the achievement. The only tedium I found was exploring the little overworld's your character's traverse, as the maps were almost entirely useless and a few secrets and a hiding kid or two drove my patience to it's limit.   Nevertheless, I would highly suggest this game for it's charm, maybe not at full price, mine was bought at a discount, but for the original I shelled out the full price, here and on my old ps3. It provided me with quite a few hours of enjoyment, it is an exceptional sequel and I would definitely buy another installment. I've always had a soft spot for Halloween. :)"

275330,Anmynor Puzzles,"It's terribly funny!! For me it has been a complete surprise, because I didn't know nothing about this game. It has some problems with the audio, but the music is funny too. There are level that are very very devilishly."
275350,Sentinel 3: Homeworld,"This is a good tower defense game. The towers, mobs and maps are well-designed. Also the scale of the maps allows for decent sized towers and mobs that are easily distinguishable, i.e. you are not looking at dots on a huge map. I also like that there are many building locations -- I don't like the games where you only get a few preset locations for builidng towers. There is some repeatability because there are different modes and levels of difficulty (and different loadouts of towers and commander abilities to choose from), and your commander unit slowly levels up."

275570,Summoner,love the game still holds up.
275670,Space Run,"FYI I did not finish the game.  Space Run is a tower defense esque like game. I said esque because you need to control some of the defense turrets (shifting their angle), operating some support system (generate backup shield, extra power supply, boost the speed). Your mission is to get as many stars as you can for each of your trip (scoring highest point). This can be done by ensuring your goods arrived intact AND you use the shortest time possible (there are three ranking for speed/time).  I like it because I like tower defense. I like how you can configure your defense to your preferred style. However, the control takes a bit too much (need more micro managing skill) which takes more effort to play. Further, some of the mission it is difficult because they enemies attack you from all angles and you need to react quickly with your limited supply of money (money is required to build turrets).   I think I left probably 5 more missions or so but I decided I do not want to grind the game anymore. I do recommend it though (casual at the beginning, but now things gets tough, I AM BAILING!)"
275810,7 Wonders of the Ancient World,"Match-3 games are still found in plague like abundence roaming wild and hunting after whales on the brutal seas of the free-to-play smartphone market, but on PC this once successful genre lies in ruins. This game stands a monument to that time before the genre found its true home. Sadly such a monument does nothing but reinforce why this genre died out on PC. It is, as such, of archaeological interest only."
275830,7 Wonders: Magical Mystery Tour,"I bought this game to just have something to play to kill a few hours. This game is great for just that. It is interesting enough for a match 3 type game to let you kill some time and play through the 'campaign' for roughly 5 hours on normal. You can then always go back and replay, but I probably won't do that once I'm through."
275850,No Man's Sky,"No Man's Sky is a game with many problems, the first being that it seems to promise so much in what comes off as very little. The game, promoting itself as having near infinite replayability due to almost infinite variety, more or less can show you all of it's content withing 3 hours, as a result of it being very repetitive. While I do have 13 hours of playtime on the game, about half of it is from being AFK in the menu while taking care of other tasks in the background. Only about 3 or 4 hours of it was me actually enjoying the game, while the rest consisted of me trying to milk my short attention span and tell myself that because I payed $60 for this game, I was going to enjoy it- and it turns out that I didn't. The free roam exploration runs dry very quickly when you soon realize that every planet gives you more or less the same experience, and while there is a 'linear' path you can take, it essentially leads nowhere, as reaching the center of the galaxy, which the game advertises as being the big finale of the game,    literally just brings you to another galaxy, ultimately relaying the message of this game, as a whole, being the sheer essence of repetitive gameplay.    Overall, No Man's Sky is a lazy game not even those with a short attention span like me can enjoy for more than say, 4 hours. The game's cycle is essentially go to a planet, find things on that planet, grind materials to get off the planet, get off the planet and travel to a new one, only to find the same things you found before and repeat the terrible mundane and overall bland process. Not even considering all of the content Hello Games promised and then silently removed, this shouldn't be something you get from a $60 game, and overall shouldn't be expected from any game promising as much as No Man's Sky did, and for that reason, I'm giving this game a bad review."

276240,My Vet Practice: In the Country,Another way to waste your money. Doesn't work on my Windows 8.1. Graphics are okay at best.   Pro's: + Nice music + Graphics are ok  Con's: - Too long and no way to speed up - Doesn't preform necessay actions - Mweh menu
276300,My Riding Stables," https://youtu.be/vZaSmVZr-VU   No matter how skilled at horse care and maintenance children should not run a stable alone without adult supervision. Tend to horses, guests and day to day ranch work with this light management sim, but do it slowly. Very Slowly.  The pacing of this game never breaks out of a trot by requiring players to idle around waiting for progress and meters to fill up. Compounding on that is the fact that time only pass in the location the player is in further reducing the quality of the simulation."
276340,My Riding Stables: Life with Horses,it was fun those 5 miuntes I could play before the game broke my screen. Now my computer is broken. :(
276360,Riding Star,"An great game. I know it from my Childhood. It includes Show Jumping, Dressage Country, and it is making a lot of Fun! No matter how old you are ... ;D "
276380,My Pet Hotel,"This game doesn't even work on my PC ( windows 8.1). Do not pick this up, in any shape or form. The graphics and textures are really bad, it does definitly shows its age.  Pro's: + Might have some drawbacks to your childhood  Con's: - Bad graphics - Poor options menu - Some actions you have to preform will not work - To long and no way to speed it up  "
276430,My Pet Hotel 2,"While I generally view myself as a patient player when it comes to SIM games I was sorely disappointed as I tried to find the joy in this game. Got it in a bundle, was excited for some mindnumbing hours of clicking on artificial animals. Instead I barely played half an hour listening to vague instructions and wondering why the screen was so darn bright.   The animals, the ones I have seen, were cute but aside from that the game is too slow and does not live up to the '2' in the title. If this is two, how bad is 1? (I would not know, it doesn't start on my laptop for some vague reason).   "
276440,Kingdom Tales,"No Brain Game, no taktik needed to beat the game."
276460,Tales From The Dragon Mountain 2: The Lair,Could have been a simple but after all quite entertaining game. But my version doesn't work and I got no help from editor despite of precise issue reporting. Seems that many other user bot stuck at the same scene of the game yet no update...
276730,Tango Fiesta,"Long story short, this game is an overpriced, junky flash game, at least at the time of this review.  The game has its humor and it's clearly visible what it wants to be, but it completely falls on its face. I can give it credit for its humor and the nice art and all, but mechanically, this is a complete mess. I've been waiting until I was finished the campaign to write this review, and it was an honest pain. Bugs a-plenty (This isn't Early Access, and is $12.99 as of this post), locked aiming to only cardinal and diagonal directions (I don't care what your ♥♥♥♥-poor reasoning behind having it be this way is, it sounds more like an excuse than an actual reason), glitchy as all hell UI (Ammo literally never showed correctly for me what my current magazine was, as well as a bunch of times where dialogue windows would cover the game), and just poor balance (Difficulty is easy in the first world, ramps pretty high in comparison for the second, levels off with an okay ramp-up for the third and fourth, and then just out of nowhere becomes absurd on the fifth). Most of the bosses just seem lazy, especially the Killionaire and Ghoul Squad ones. The champion enemies that drop health and ammo have a crazy-high health multiplier to the point that it takes several mags to destroy one if the wrong enemy happens to get it, and in the case of the last world, if the floating head enemies are a champion, they have health equal to that of a miniboss, and still never actually drop their equipment. Melee is a completely useless function for the most part, the character differences don't really make a noticeable impact until you're forced to change your playstyle because of the level's enemies, guns don't very well describe how they are in comparison to others, despite their being stat windows for each, each weapon requires you to essentially run around in circles and endlessly kill enemies to grind for the money to buy them, instead of just being accomplishment rewards, or having the prices be within check. I haven't tried the multiplayer, but if it's as bad as the singleplayer is with its glitches and problems, I dread to think about it. There's so many issues for a game that's supposed to be finished that it'd be laughable if it wasn't so frustrating and disappointing trying to, in vain, have an enjoyable time with it.  Honestly, for the price, just get Nuclear Throne instead. At its price, this game is most definitely not worth it. I probably wouldn't even recommend it on sale. You could find better browser-based games of the same ilk for free."
276750,Fritz Chess 14,Good program but the absence of a pdf manual is a real downside.
276810,Mordheim: City of the Damned,"As you can see by the many hours I've put into this game, I find it to be the most fun game I've ever played, at least on PC. And I'm a quite a very active player.  As many others beofre me have stated, this game is very punishing and you need to embrace that, or it's not for you. The RNG isn't flawed at all, it's just that because the game can be so punishing, having some bad rolls can make you quite frustrated and think the RNG is broken. That's because most people don't understand statistics. They think two missed 90% rolls is a conspiracy in a gamewhere hundreds of rolls are made per mission. If you have 10 warriors each hitting twice per turn at 90%, there should statistically be two misses. But when it happens, people think RNG is broken.  The game has some DLC but they are not needed to enjoy the game, and the AI will play all DLC races against you even if you did not buy them. There is a lot of grind to be done in this game, adnd I am not even close to be done with all the hours I've put in, but noen of the grind is necessary at all. It's just a nice added incentive to keep going while you develop your warband.  TI haven't even done all the story misisons, but they're pretty fun. Some can be very hard though. For me, multiplayer is where the real fun is. I am an admin of the currently only active MP league, called the Mordheim MP Permaleague. We have a great system for doing fair matches and anyone can join with a new team and play on equal terms against others. What's fun with MP games is that there are tow modes. Exhibition games without permanent effects afterwards, or Contest games with permanent effects. The league I play in do Contest games. So any loot you grab off your opponent you get to keep and they lose it, any injuries you suffer are there to stay, and so on. It's great fun if you can accept that you WILL suffer losses. But league players also get AI games that they can use to recover in when needed.  Unfortunately this game lacks a server based matchmaking system, and that is its biggest flaw.  Pros: - Best Games Workshop game adaption to date with its awesome fantasy and lore. - Awesome an helpful community. - Devs stays in close touch with the players and do balancing changes based on community feedback and they have a great sense of humor and a genuine interest in the game. - Many different warbands that all have a very unique playstyle and spellcasters (if you own all DLCS, base game has 4 warbands which still is enough for many many hours). - Very long replayability because there are countless of diffferent viable skill builds to make and toy with for each class and race. - Lots of skills to choose from, where most of them are quite useful. - Procedually generated maps and many different deployment types. - A lot of different runes to discover and enhance your gear with. - Generally a good economy system where you'll find yourself in short of money for a very long time unless you're quite skilled and know what you're doing. - The become a 'pro' player you will probably need hundreds of hours and understand how to work the RNG in your favor, which is a good thing!  Cons: - Punishing and unforgiving, can cause serious ragequits. - Poor AI pathing, especially with Impressives often getting stuck. An issue that's still not been resolved after a year. - Some very annoying bugs connected to ambushes, stairs and obstacles on the ground, that can cause desyncs in MP games. - No MP matchmaking system. If you want to play MP you need to find friends, ask in the forums, or join a league. - Some skills are pretty useless, but they're thankfully not that many and with a lot to choose from it will not impact overall gameplay. - Devs go very silent between DLCs/patches, and become very active and communicative weeks before such a release. Could be more consistently visible on the forums. - Lack of customisation options for your warband. There are some, but generally fairly limited. Doesn't bother me much, but for many it does. "
276870,Dwelvers, Early Access Review
276890,FATE: Undiscovered Realms,my curser will not go down enough in-game to click anything other than 'continue'
277110,Return to Mysterious Island,Ok......so where do I start with this game. Well I have 7.4 hours on record for this game which turned out to be 7 hours too many. This game caused 7.4 hours of argurments and anger in my household. As a female game player I typically enjoy these types of games but after probably the first half hour found out that there was no logic whatsoever to this game. You have to be some mad scientist MacGyver and craft items that make no sense at all. This game was sooo irritating and I continued to play to see if ultimately it would make any sense or at least have a good ending. But alas neither logic or a good ending came and at the end i was just left with far too many hours invested and a hugely disappointed ending. So if you enjoy the type of game that you could be totally mindless and rely on the help of a trained monkey then by all means enjoy this game. If not do not get this game (unless you have a smart phone or tablet readily available).
277270,Return to Mysterious Island 2,the thing is with the first game is that it totally seems like a casual ordinary experience. it isn't until the last third of the game things start to get creepy. well this game expands upon that last third x100. ♥♥♥♥'s cray. overall a much more interesting game but people tend to say it's not as good as the first. it's kind of hard to judge when the game mechanics are so simple.  7/10
277390,VIDEOBALL,"Decent game, way overhyped in the reviews/media I read and saw about it before purchasing. Online Mode is a waste, nobody is ever on. Totally baffling they have that as a selling point, do these guys not realize you have to have OTHER PEOPLE online to actually use the mode? Arcade Mode is nothing special, fun at first but gets repetitive. If you know a ton of people who'd like to play and have extra controllers then Local Mode could be fun."
277430,Halo: Spartan Assault,"This Game Is Amazing! Believe It Or Not I Have Never Played Halo. So I Picked It Up TODAY And Its Awesome. I Have Never Been So Hoked To A Story In A Game Like This Before. I Also Bought HALO Spartan Strike (Came In The Bundle) Which I Wiill Play When Finished With This Game. I Saw The Reviews For Both Games I Was Like, 'You Know What **** This Take My 5 Dollars! And Now Look Where I Am. Playing THE 2 GREATEST SHOOTER GAMES UNDER 5 Dollars! You Just Gotta Release More Halo!...."
277450,Imperial Glory,Nice! this game is original totalwar game but its amazing!
277460,Praetorians,"Go read the full review.  This game sucks! Don't buy that piece of trash! Although it's an old game, and many people say they like it, because it was good back then, it is not good today. Thos is a review about if and why I recommend or don't recommend this game. I don't recommend to buy it at these days!"
277470,The Book of Legends,I didn't touch this game yet. 10/10!!!
277490,Battle Group 2,"Very simple fun game, like tower defence or something but very addictive. Worth the price."
277500,Farming World,"Please do not buy this game If you are looking for a SIMFARM type game... This is not it! OMG! I really wanted to like it, I really did. It is not figured out! As in I Bet my life on the fact that the creators of this game have never tried playing it.  If you buy animals you have to sit next to them during the entire game to fix broken fences. Most hated is the fact the whenever ANYTHING happens, you get an alert and lose your fast forward.  Crop planting is ridiculous..... Just dont buy it. It sucks...... Moving on to find something else..."
277510,Shiny The Firefly,"Horrible horrible horrible port for PC. The mouse movement is very sluggish, the game often confuses the player and does something else.. Just avoid this poor thing of a game.."
277520,Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space,"Fantastic game, more puzzle based then fighting, but to many errors, way to many, and the controls need work. so I have to say no."
277540,Tales From The Dragon Mountain: The Strix,"I give this game 2 out of 5 muffins. For the most part, the story is extremely disjointed and this starts in the opening scene. It feels almost as if they are re-telling a story that you are supposed to know. Most of the puzzles are unexplained and easily solved by just randomly clicking.  Not worth more than $1.59"
277560,Where Angels Cry,"This game is really short, two hours to get all the collectibles and finish every puzzle without skipping through any dialog. The backgrounds are pretty, but the characters are most definitely not, standing there absolutely still like statues. The voice acting is really bad for the most part, a couple of characters are kinda alright but nearly every character had me wanting to just read the text and jump to the next line. The music seems alright at first, but the high points are distorted and hurt my ears, had to mute it.   All of this is fine, especially for an indie game, the main problem is the stupid puzzles. For example, there must be 7 times through the game where you need to pull nails out of wood with pliers, but you have to find a different set of pliers every time because your character is a complete idiot, they just vanish from your inventory. I've had plenty of puzzle games remove items from my inventory once they become non-relevant, but the pliers stay relevant all the way to the end of the game, shovels and hammers are repeatedly needed too, they're removed just to force you into more needless scavenger hunts. The puzzles  The areas change in a weird way, at one point there are numbers carved on these pillars as clues, the next day they're just gone, the pillars are still there, carvings are not, I started to think my character hallucinated all of the events of the game."
277590,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"It has a nice background for AC series. Recommend if you are an AC fan. However skipping all such and alike issues, I spent 6 hours in the game and felt I'm done. (Perhaps because I came through all the previous games in this series and I needed some time to recover my interest in such game) Hope the '6 hours' provides some idea."
277630,Panzer Tactics HD,"No No No! Could be fair enough for some handheld console but not for PC. Panzer General 3D has 15 years and looks better. This so called HD is joke, same sound for shooting aircraft and infantry...? Game has some good ideas, and some making it dumb. But still I'm 'NO NO NO'."
277650,Kult: Heretic Kingdoms,Amateurish is perhaps the most favorable description I would apply to this game. The background/world has a permanently blurred appearance. The controls are crude and don't follow the usual convetions for games of this type. I readily admit I didn't get very far or give it much of a chance beyond the first 5 minutes. There was simply nothing about it which compelled me to go any further.
277680,"About Love, Hate and the other ones","Released on iOS in 2012, and Steam in 2014, About Love, Hate and the other ones is an underrated should-be classic. And by underrated, I don't mean 'a game I like that no one else does'. Most people who play it love it. It's won several awards, and for good reason too.  So why am I reviewing it now? Because it deserves an audience.   Gameplay"
277700,On Rusty Trails,"Its short and sweet. I imagine pretty replayable. Its animations are smooth, design is fitting, and music very nice. Adds up to a pretty nice atmosphere. Its one of the rare games where the story and themes are benefited and represented through the gameplay. For that reason alone this game should be praised above most others. The gameplay is constantly fresh and kept surprising me with various new ways that they could use old mechanics. It has a few things that could be polished a bit but that is really nitpicking. Buy this game."
277850,Sportsfriends,"There should be a disclaimer for people purchasing this on PC. It should be written at that top that this will not work with just a keyboard. I don't play games very often, so I never even thought that it would require the use of a seperate controller. The game was very fun on PS4, but I'm very disapointed that I spent $15 and can't play it."
277870,Diehard Dungeon,Very frustrating but so good.
277890,Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut,"Shantae is the longer sister of Shaq genie that must restore his basketball playing ablity or be and destroyed.  I cannot recomend because Jin, are spawns of the devil and Allah does not promote witchcraft, magic or any of that nonsense!"
277910,Mars Colony: Challenger,"To be honest this is most likly the worst game I have ever played. The concept looked nice, and this building junk ,but I never really got into it. It just seemed terrible borning.  So once I got the game I basically exected it to be a whole lot more entertaining. Building stuff with people, managing  supplize, and so one. Though after about four hours I just quit. One of the reasons is that everything was so outdated. The look seemed more like a production of 2001  It seemed like a very good idea ,but someone must of felt tired of going on ,and just stoped.  -Graphics are really poor, There really isn't any physics. Though I bet it was because it was to give the space feal.  Though the miss one thing in that is that your on mars, there is gravity people  -The sound wasn't very good either. I known its in space ,but come on almost every space game has more sound than this.  -The Intructions wern't very good. Often times I would find myself half-guessing just because the instructions wern't clear enough. For example I was just try to manage the oxygen for ten minutes, finally ending up getting it. Then I notice that I was using up unessary upkeep as well.  -Finally the last thing that really told me to stop playing this is that its so DREADFULLY borning. I think I even got a headake because of it. I felt most of it was just place this here, turn this knob, refill something repeat. There hardly was anything exciting in the game.   -To be honest I hoped it would be a great game ,and I wanted it to be that. Though it was just a big disapointment when I got there. Though so much for those five dollars. Take my advise ,and buy a diffrant steam game when it is on sale.    "
277930,TUG, Early Access Review
277950,Deadbreed®,"I love the gameplay and the new updates.Graphics are good and it's pretty enjoyable and simple to play for newcomers .You should definetely try this game ,especially if you enjoy MOBAs,The only down side it's that it's not so full of players like Dota or LOL,sadly,but overall it's a pretty good MOBA and unique and now is free to play!"

278080,DYNASTY WARRIORS 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition,"Having played nearly every game in the Dynasty Warriors series and similar 'Warriors' spin-offs, I was surprised to see that after 8 official installments, not a lot has changed. The gameplay and game feel are identical to the first time I remember playing the series which is both good and bad. The cheesy voiceacting, the terrible AI (that either stands around not hitting you or stands around doing nothing but blocking so you can't hurt them), the huge amount of playable characters and weapons to use, and the countless of men you will kill effortlessly usnig magical special attacks etc..  The biggest gripe I have is that right from the very first battle and right from the very first moment in the game you have about a million weapons to choose from. Many of the weapons have full compatibility for no reason at all which means that you can basically make every character identical in stat if you wanted giving no preference to certain weapons on certain characters (Lu Bu doesn't need to use a Halberd at all for example... there's no added benefit).  The game is best played from lower difficulty up, starting with normal and working from there... if you jump straight into hard mode, you'll be horrified to learn that your own character is not adjusted to the difficulty and will die very easily. You are essentially forced to play a lesser difficulty to level yourself up, or simply grind levels again and again to prepare yourself for final stages.  On harder difficulty, the enemies AI is so bad that the officers simply block for days making it a game of patience, however the fact that there are 20 of them on the battlefield definitely doesn't help you out, and you realize quickly that your own officers are SO BAD at fighting that they will die. You spend most of the time in hard mode running from one side of the map to the other saving your own generals from death because of their lack of ability. Failure to do so will result in having to do campaigns over and over again as you watch your own generals die in rage-inducing simple battles. 'What's that? Lu Bu is whining about needing help on the other side of the map? There aren't even any officers around him so he can handle it. I'm fighting 5 officers right now personally....... wait... LU BU DIED? I have to start this campaign over again?!'  The other struggle is typical of ALL Dynasty Warriors games, in that the story very quickly becomes as repetative as the background music. Once you do one campaign, you've basically seen the story unfold, and are then forced to do the same story but win for the other side or win for an ally in the same exact way.  We're still lacking a very fluid jumping motion on characters, we're still lacking in the martial arts department, we're still having to deal with invisible walls and limited battlefields, we're still having to deal with very llawed AI........ still, it's fun to effortlessly kill thousands of men on a battlefield, and that's good enough for me..... but not a game I will go back to very quickly to play again.  If you've played any Dynasty Warriors games in the past, I would NOT recommend this game to you. It's more of the same. If you have never played one, then definitely check it out at least once for an authentic DW experience."
27810,GridRunner Revolution,Buy this now!!!!!!
278100,RIVE,"  This is a fantastic arcade shooter/platformer with imaginative level design and several reasons to keep coming back. Fun to blow things up, so long as you can tolerate the annoying main character, which I suprisingly have!   https://megabadger24.wordpress.com/2017/01/03/my-top-ten-best-games-of-2016-10-6/ "
278190,ACID Music Studio 10 - Steam Powered,where is the serial number?
278360,A Story About My Uncle,"If there was a mixed review option I would choose that, this game is fun and has an interesting story but it felt too short. If you're bored and this game is on sale I'd recommend getting it, but under any other circumstances there would be no reason to buy the game."
278440,0RBITALIS,"This is a very interesting physics based game. You are trying to establish a trajectory that meets certain criteria, either a stable orbit, hitting certain targets in the least amount of time, orbiting through different sectors of the screen and so forth. Some of the levels are very easy, but others are maddeningly difficult. I keep promising to give up on the last level I have to complete, but I keep coming back and trying again. No matter how frustrated I get I keep coming back. This is why I nominated it for the 'test of time' award. Good luck and enjoy this simple yet often extremely frustrating game."
278460,Skyborn," Yea!  Great level design    Decent soundtrack    Story and writting is not bad for an RPGmaker game    No random encounters    Meh!  Combat is very easy, almost no challenge til the very end    When in battle can't tell enemy health with out attacking    Crafting system seemed useless   Bleh!  Steam overlay doesnt work    Can not change the resolution of the game    Last boss is OP, with out going out and completing all side content   Gist: A decent RPGmaker game with a ok save the little people story. The game does not have random encounters but enemies who move around the map allowing you to skip when you do not feel like fighting. Combat also comes off as very easy, where you only have to hit attack with a heal thrown in every so often. And hence the problem with the game since the combat is so easy you can breeze through the game, but the final bosss hits you like a wall in which you might need all the side content to beat, without luck. I do recommend this game but only if you can find it on sale as the price point for whats given is way to high."
278490,Aveyond 3-2: Gates of Night,Played for 11 minutes. talked to random people. skipped all dialogue. didnt know the story. relised that this is pretty much a talking simulator rip off of pokemon and final fantasy. fought a rat. instant death from one critical hit. quit game. uninstalled.   10/10 would talk again.
278510,JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD - Resurrection -,"These are great games. Do not be mistaken by my assassment of this particular port. This review speaks to the product at the state that it was originally relased on Steam. The games herein still play like butter and are highly refined examples of why the shmup/shooter/STG genre is so compelling, fun, and relevent.  However, one of the key componets for games like these is Score chasing. These two games are built around the idea of 'high-score'. All of the gameplay mechanics within are in service to the scoring system itself. If one can agree with this, then one may find the lack of online Leaderboards in this Steam version to be a very huge disappointment. Online leaderboards shouldn't be an afterthought or a missing feature for modern games of this type.   What makes this even more frustrating is that I own these games in their previous incarnation on the Xbox 360. That version, which is what I beleve this port was ported from, has fully funtional online leaderboards. That version remains the superior version, play it there if you don't wanna feel like you've been cut-off from the rest of the world.  So close to being pure bliss it hurts."
278530,3 Stars of Destiny,"Main character is named Random. Big red flag right there. I mean, come on. Random?"
278550,A-Train 9 V4.0 : Japan Rail Simulator,"On the fence but no can not recommend this game sadly, especially at this price point. Some say it's rich and complex, yet when you begin to peel back the layers, at least I find that's not the case. The AI builds randomly in a hodge podge of buildings mixing in residential with industry and industry with agriculture resulting in not being able to build a realistic city; that is without without reserving all the land and placing buildings yourself or building directly in the editor. If I wanted to place all my buildings I'd be playing another city builder that also includes transport, 3 come to mind. Realistic growth is not possible from the AI and that's a shame, in fact it's a game breaker for me. For those that think I did not give it enough time I was a version 3 owner, so familiar with the basic of the game from the start, frankly I had the same complaints with the prior version but had not played it in so long had forgotten why I disliked it.  Scheduling trains and laying out track and roads is where the meat of the game is, but once you realize you have little control over how your city develops all the fun goes away, sure you can supply parts of the city differently with goods and passengers but the ai is still going to build randomly regardless. I'm not looking for simcity zoning here, but an AI that follows my lead at least a little when I place a subsidiary is what I would like to see.   A moderator or dev here mentioned making some videos, should those show my points wrong I will gladly change my review. If you don't mind placing all your buildings yourself or using the editor to build cities then this game may be for you, but if you want your city to grow organically around you in a semi-realistic manner I'd have to say look elsewhere."
278570,Labyrinthine Dreams,"This game tells the story of a girl who doesn't know where she's going in life, and intersperses it with some pretty tricky puzzles. The story isn't amazing, but is good, and the puzzles are solid, and don't overstay their welcome. You'll get about an hour or maybe a bit more out of this."
278590,Heroes of Legionwood,"I have onyl play 20 minutes but the controls were clunky and some of the skills didn't work as they 'should' have done based on their description. e.g. I get poisoned, use somehting to remove poison and it removes some of the poison;'s damage not the poison, meanin a waste"
278620,TinyKeep,"My Review for Tiny Keep shall be as short and sweet as possible.  This is a top-down style dungeon crawler. Its has many rougue-like elements, with perma-death and randomly-selected upgrades for your characters. In terms of how polished the game is, it could have been better in terms of physics and graphics, but besides that the game is as good as its gonna get.  In my travels (only about 2.5 hrs of play as of this review, but growing) i've found every part of tiny keep exciting and fun. I started as a weekling, found some lucky loot, and started slashing my way through hordes of enemies. On my third try, i made it all the wayt to the end boss, only to slip up once or twice and get mercilessly squashed. Thus, i had to start over. While thats a huge bummer and a solid 2 hours of my life i shall never get back, i had lots of fun playing and will definitley play again soon.  Overall, 8/10. Would be higher if there was a bit more to the game, (only about 20 5-15 minute levels). The Pros that give it this high score are: High Re-playability (unless you beat the game 100% on second try like i almost did. depends on the skill of the player) Fun Dungeon crawling interesting upgrade system Solid plot that got my head right in the game.  Highly recommend."
278640,Terrian Saga: KR-17,"Plateforming Shooter Master Game. I cannot put into words of how incredible this game truly is. First off, I got this game for $0.49. 49 cents for a game that is breath taking. It can run on a potato computer. It has amazing graphics for a pixel plateformer, And for the price of $0.49 you can't complain whatsoever. Avalable on basicly all computers weather it's windows, mac or linux. Reminds me alot of the Super Nintendo and the SEGA Genisis. It's just a truly amazing game, even if it's not on sale go ahead and buy it because this is possibly one of the best plateformer I've ever played. It's got story, Characters, everything you want in a good game right here. Go on ahead and buy it!"

278850,Spaceforce Homeworld,"You get whay you pay for... and I got this game for free.  The gameplay is a lot worse than it shows off. Now I lot my retro games, I must have spent at least a good $20 every Saturday morning at the local arcade(which was in a bowling alley) so I knew what this game was going to be like. Heck I still have the original luna lander and that game is better than this.  I won't review the graphics or audio because they are both exactly what they show off... pseudo-80's/90's semi-realistic photos that move. No issue with that.  The issue is the fire button is permanently locked to Left-hand mouse and the shields(missiles) to the Right hand button, yet the movement is keyboard based... what the?!!!  And if you press 'ESC' to check the controls or something of the menu... YOU QUIT YOUR GAME!!!! You cannot resume or anything. You'd think they'd give a warning like 'Do you really want to quit?' but nooooo.  Not worth $5 USD. Maybe $1... if it was better by... I don't know... being able to re-assign the keys!  I'm going back to Luna Lander now or maybe some Sopwith Camel. Either is better than this.  P.s. How does this game take up almost 200mbs?!!! Have people just given up on compression?!!"
278890,Angvik,Oddly I am drawn back to this game a few people have said it is short but the game gets harder and harder so it is very changeling I go back to it again and again I am sick of all the shooters out there so enjoy this fun filled platform game level you weapons’ and gear with the oils and send the birds flying enjoy  Oh yeah and don’t forget the shepherd he shoot sheep and wears pink haha just don’t get hit off your own sheep  have not played in a while but still love it
278910,Interplanetary,"I wasn't interested in playing this competitively against players, so I can't speak to that aspect of the game, but the AI skirmishes are extremely poorly implemented, making the game not very fun, and actually damaging the 'hard sci-fi realism' aspect they were aiming for. The AI opponents have a 100% hit chance with any weapon at any distance under any circumstances, while you are limited to either blindly guessing on trajectories, or relying on a targetting redline that becomes innacurate the INSTANT you hit next turn, as its assumtions are all based on where planetary bodies are, NOT where they will be. Note to developers, for the past several centuries we have possessed the mathematical wherewithal to accurately predict planetary movements, so its probably fair to expect that the targetting technology your civilization is relying on in this game would be able to predict those same movements accurately. TL;DR, its not fun from a game standpoint to get stomped instantly, and you ruined your attempt at realism by failing to do any homework whatsoever."
278930,Gigantic Army,"Well for someone who likes this genre, this game difficulty is like medium-hard and it isn't really long but does it's job."
278970,DiggerOnline,"Got the game while it was free, then it was bad, now it is even vorse couse its pay to kill yourself."
27900,Twin Sector,"You played Portal right? Well, imagine that instead of chambers you have to run through a starship... and finding out that you're not alone in there. Besides you and OSCAR of course.  Fast pacing, interesting gameplay and nice story. Worth playing."

279160,Ultionus: A Tale of Petty Revenge,"Cute game, but the controls are pretty rough (purposely so, but that doesn't do it any favors) and the infinitely respawning enemies are just plain annoying. It has a few fun moments, but the majority of the game is all about dying to the bosses multiple times to learn their pattern.   Game doesn't work with x360ce, it makes every button-press both jump AND shoot. Without x360ce, my PS3 controller's Square button jumped, and X fired, VERY VERY awkward! No option in-game to customize the controls. Did not try playiing with an XBox controller.  The music is the best part of the game, but the artist (Jake Kaufman) has better work."

279260,Richard & Alice,"richard &amp; alice is a game mostly about alice telling richard, whilst they're both imprisoned in an underground jail, about her days surviving a snowy apocalypse with her young son. the nice thing i can say about the game is that it is well-written; the dialogue is believable and the themes the story discusses are handed competently, if not exactly profoundly.  everything else about the game is kind of terrible though. the worst part is the walking speed, which is ludicrously slow. the environments are very small, but it can still take a minute or two just to get from one end of a map to another; this becomes very tedious when backtracking gets involved, usually to fetch an item to solve one of the game's puzzles, if they could even be called that considering how mundane and obvious their solutions are. the only time i got stuck was when i couldn't figure out that a path to another area opened up, and that's only because it wasn't pointed out textually nor visually. multiple endings are usually a plus, but considering that their flags aren't always at the end of the game the busywork required to get them makes them far less appealing.  the game is not very pretty either, with minimal animation and bland maps (despite there being only like, 15 or so), and the music is either royalty-free or otherwise unmemorable. i've also experienced an issue where the audio stutters every time the scene changes; i realize that adventure game studio isn't the best engine, but i've played games made in it that are far more graphically intensive yet felt like they ran better. lastly, there's a cameo that's so hamfisted it honestly feels like advertising for a much better game.  overall, richard &amp; alice kept me interested enough to see what would happen next, but that's it. the glacial pace of its gameplay was annoying, i don't feel like i've experienced anything new from its story, and while the characters and events were realistic, perhaps even sympathetic, i can't say i truly cared about any of them. i've gotten 3 out of 5 endings, including the one that involved the most effort, but none of them were particularly remarkable and i really don't feel like putting in another half-hour of walking back and forth just to get the last two.  i'd like to say i'll end up forgetting this game existed, but i'll probably remember it if only because of how intensely banal it ended up being. so that's something i guess. this is the end of the review. the end."
27940,Dead Horde,"Do not buy it. I mean seriously. Nation Red is 100x better than this. I coul'dve liked it if I haven't tried Nation red before, but it's not smooth, the guns are bad and the gameplay is too rigid. Didn't liked it"
279420,Gardens Inc. – From Rakes to Riches,"Pros  - Doesn't require a super computer to run  - Challenging game-play that doesn't require Superman's reflexes and Batman's intelligence to get past the third level.  - Visually pleasing, doesn't rely on hyper-realism  - The storyline is decidedly not about people murdering each other in a gory war between good and evil  Cons  - Very weak cliche storyline  - There isn't really much time during the actual level to plan what to do and it can quickly devolve into a mindless click fest (Usually to your detriment in later levels)  - Somewhat counter intuitive interface  I rate this 3 moe out of 5 kawaii"
279440,Joe Dever's Lone Wolf HD Remastered,"In this game you are able to type your own story, you can choose between multiple choices and to change your 'adventure's future' by them. The combat on here is an old school combat, you have to choose an attack and then after your player attacks the enemy attacks back, you have to click / drag your mouse in the right time to get the full damage out of your attack.  Honestly I didn't really like the game, im not a fan of this style of a game but i do think many people can love it and play it for hours. So i recommend it."
279460,IHF Handball Challenge 14,"I was waiting for this game.. It was over advertised, took a long time to develop.. but the final result is probably the worst game I ever bought and played. Totally disapponted by this game. And I'm sure many handballers and fans will be as disappointed. It was probably better to make an 'Handball Manager'-ish game, instead, giving the result. Difficult to play, embarassing animations (we're almost in 2015)... I expected something better, since the game has been advertised four / five years ago!!"
279480,Abalone,If only they would fix this horribly broken game
279500,Nicolas Eymerich The Inquisitor,"To put this succinctly as possible, this game sucks and its main characture is of such a rabidly intolorant characture as to make this game a distinct displeasure. If I had met such a person as this Eymerich in person, in real life, I would rather see him dead than suffer him."
279520,Rage Runner,"wish i could get money back, seeing as i didnt like thegame at all. Wasted money."
279540,Pretentious Game,"Fun little game, much like Thomas was alone. Would not buy this game though unless you can get it really cheap from a sale or something. Would rather recomend Thomas was alone."
279560,Dracula 4 and  5 - Special Steam Edition,"★☆☆☆☆ - 'Dont touch it, its not worth your time'   PROS: - Two games for the price of one - Both games actually look okay graphically. - Nice interface - It has a nice soundtrack.  CONS: - Very bad storyline - Whilst graphically decent and some attention to detail the environments still feel somewhat empty - Puzzles are far too easy and tedious  VERDICT?  I quite like point &amp; click games but this did not hold my interest whatsoever."
279580,Devil's Dare,"Bought this game for my mac, crashes on launch. Re-installed, got it to run once, but still crashes on launch. Posted in discussion/ emailed devs, no response. Still waiting to hear back, paid for a game that won't launch. This is the only game in my steam library that won't launch."
279640,The Troma Project,I will try to express how i felt in the game in long story short. The games rating is i have to say 11/10 and i RECCOMEND the game on sany time the price is just too low it shoud be atleasy 70$ i woud say buy and donate 60$  Pros: +Its fun to play for 1 hour.. +Has voice acting :DDDDDDDDDD. +Kill Nazi. +Old time design. +So many good things i cant describe them all  Cons: -There isnt any choices you can make except kill or not kill  -After a while the NAZI take over your brain -When you die you rage quit becouse you get that its too good for you. -there is everything wrong but thats what Overall: The game is so freaking bad it makes the game good and fun in one way.
279720,The I of the Dragon,"I dont recommand this game right now because its buggy on my system.  I know its an old game but they shoudld fix some issue for player.  There is a link below with most of the common fix to play the game, but hope developper will update their game soon!"
279740,3D ParticleGen Visual FX,"Looked like a good software at a price you can not grumble at, however this software is broken and all though I did get a response from the developers they did not fix the problem or offer any help after the first email. Don't waste your money!!!!"
279800,Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan,A very nice casual game in a fairy tale setting. I truly recommend this if you like story rich point and click games. In the beginning of the game you can choose the difficulty mode (amount of hints etc.). I played the casual mode and completed the actual game and the extra adventure in 6 hours.
279900,Soul Axiom,"Now here's an easy recommendation. Beatufil, polished, very original and with decent flow. Love it!"
279920,Infinity Runner,Finaly got it to work consistantly! Customisable controls are apreciated. Your cant slide into that air vent!
279940,The Book of Unwritten Tales 2,How to describe This awesome game this is maybe the best point and click adventure out there and i really recommend the first one and critter chronicles just pure gold.
279990,Bridge Constructor Playground,10/10 ign kinda fast to finish it tho took me under 3 hours to do so... pretty much like the other games get this game if you like silly games else no
280,Half-Life: Source,this game is really fun
2800,X2: The Threat,"When Wing Commander Privateer and Elite II Dangerous came out, they had things called autopilot or hyperspace. It was a simple concept - when nothing's happening and no threats are present, you hit a button and your ship travels through space and simply cuts to the action. It was a great idea, and those games are remembered as great successes. This game, however, prefers to make you sit and wait in the cockpit with the universe's jankiest time compression device that turns off near ships, star gates, stations, random gusts of wind, and whenever it wants to. You can turn up the time compression factor as much as you want, this game is mostly sitting and waiting and sitting and waiting.   In short, this game is incapable of doing something its predecessors in the 90's could do - be fun and not waste my time."
28000,Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days,"Awesome and gritty game. Good story, good charahcters, good fun. Its more of a cinematic experience than a shooter. Also, play it on hard otherwise its just 3h to complete. Althugh, I've completed hard in 5 hours. Still great game, must play just adjust your expectations."
280010,Gunjitsu,   Early Access Review
280040,A Wizard's Lizard,This game is a lot of fun but wayy too easy booted it up again now after quite a few months and cleared it in the first run from a fresh savefile in half an hour. Still though it is a fun game so for those not used to rougelikes id recomend it.
280140,Millennium - A New Hope,"Gameplay was decent, but I quit playing when I found out online that there's a place (the forge) that has to be visited early to get some of the good items or the chance is lost forever. Since I didn't know this beforehand, and didn't feel like going back to and old save, nor felt like missing some content, I just quit. If you know about this beforehand, it's probably not hard to avoid."
280160,Aragami,"I was originally going to give this a thumbs-up review, despite some annoying glitches. The gameplay has been really enjoyable and interesting and difficult in exactly the right ways... right up until the end of the sixth 'map,' at which point the game suddenly pulled a 180 and now MUST elicit a scathing review from me!  This game casts itself as a 'stealthy' (you can go high-chaos, if you please) 'deal with the bad guys' game, with a unique ambiance and intriguing story line. Through the first six 'maps,' I was growing increasingly hooked and thinking that this was similar to Dishonored in all the right ways! Great game. Yayyy!  But, suddenly, and without the slightest indication that THIS is in the offing, the sixth 'map' turns into a very hard 'jumping puzzle' that requires you to exercise a complicated series of fast-twitch, under-duress jumps upward onto spinning platforms, dodging light-scythes, and dying again and again.  And again.  And yet again.  Rinse and repeat until it's just not worth in anymore. Game over.  Look, there are people that are good at these things, and some even enjoy them. I do NOT, and I did NOT buy this game to have a sudden and ENTIRE change to the advertised NATURE of the difficulty, such that suddenly I need a brain transplant to get over this artificial-difficulty hurdle to continue the game. Had ONE WORD been said about 'jumping puzzle' in any description, I would not have paid even the $14 for this game. I HATE jumping puzzles, particularly the fast-twitch versions of them.  I DESPISE game designers that introduce these 'gatekeeper' difficulties into games that, in effect, block the progression of players who either aren't good at these sorts of things or simply are not willing to endure the TEDIUM of working and working it until you HAPPEN to get good and lucky in the same attempt and 'make it' over the hurdle!  Listen, a BOSS fight that is IN CHARCTER with the rest of the game can be irritating, but it totally depends on how radically the difficulties suddenly increase. But when the devs introduce what is entirely ARTIFICIAL (because it's not in harmony with ALL of the rest of the character of the gamplay) difficulty as a mere DEVICE to put a halt to progress, well, frankly that is SO offputting that it takes what was a great game up to that point and suddenly turns it into trash.  I cannot say it strongly enough: Devs, when you do this sort of thing, you are IDIOTS, and you literally break faith with the players that have been progressing through your game and enjoying it UNTIL they hit your artificial wall!  So, if you are a gamer contemplating purchasing this game, BE WARNED! You WILL reach a point at which SUDDENLY it becomes a completely different game, and unless you 'want it badly enough' to be willing to endure dozens to hundreds of tries to solve a stupid, 'gatekeeper,' jumping puzzle, you are really getting between one-third and one-half of a game, because you will not progress beyond this STUPID jumping puzzle.  So, wait for the price to drop accordingly, I mean BELOW what you HAD been willing to pay. Like me, you're going to enjoy a total of six 'maps,' and then it's just not worth it to endure the price you must pay to continue."
280180,Hover, Early Access Review
280200,Eterium,"An excellent starfighter game--reminds me a lot of the old Wing Commander games.  You play as a starfighter pilot aboard a carrier, the U.E.A. Canopus. Fairly straight forward war story with pretty well structured missions and a bit of surprises here and there. The dynamic difficuality thing and game design even means you won't always have the same play through. For example, you might not have to dog fight in an asteroid field or you might encounter patrol boats rather than a destroyer. Good touches! Design is more of a win than the plot.  The game offers both fun and challenge: more so from the mission design than what you'll find from the A.I. at 'Normal'. I especially love that the games combat model balances guns and missiles. Your weapon payloads are fairly realistic, it's not too few to be combat effective and no where near enough to paint deep space in exhaust trails. You carry a loadout not to foreign from real world aircraft of today. It doesn't try to be overly realistic beyond that, those used to arcade games won't be left in the cold.  Weapons are simple and straight forward. Mainly divided by lock type (nearest target, locked target, and forget about it: we don't need no stinking locks). You'll find yourself reyling on missiles a fair bit but with no way out of a scrape without fighting it out with guns. Various gun types differ in range, damage, and rate of fire. Selection of space craft is average.  If you want a serious starfighter game this is about as good as you're gonna find on Steam. Last time I had anywhere near this much fun in such a game: I was a kid piloting X-Wings on a SEGA 32X in Star Wars Arcade, and that was a hell of a long time ago."
280220,Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal,"Very pleasing, creative, sandbox-style tower defense game."
280360,Interstellaria,"I wanted to like this one and loved the amount of work that went into it, but ultimately it seems that I've missed the point. There seems to be a lot of waiting in this game while you tell crew members to do something and then just watch them do it. So detailed, so many cool concepts, but for me, it just didn't come together. I can't say it's bad, but it's probably not for everyone."
280380,Uprising44: The Silent Shadows,another unimaginative 1st person shooter. Left me unimpressed
280460,Pulstar,I played it for 5 minutes but wondered why this game is even on steam. It's basically an ipad or phone game.
280500,KRUNCH,"personally I loved Krunch thought it was brillant, 10/10 was really great"
280520,Crea,"Alrighty. I don't see how I can run Arma 3 at 120+ frames. But on this, I get 30 tops... Optimize.  Other than that, the concept it cool I guess. Pretty much the same thing as Terraria, but with a twist. Terraria is obviously better than this game, but Crea is, different enough I suppose, to be considered a different game... Maybe not. Hostile slimes when you spawn? I, I dont know. I couldn't get that far in the game considering I was stuttering like Eric Maye. Look up Eric Maye. Thats pretty much this games performance in a nutshell... I don't want it to sound like Im dogging on this game, because if that is indeed is what im doing, I also want to point out that this game does have potential. All this game needs is an optimization update. Then I'll be all over this, but till then. I'm putting this guy up on the shelf.  *EDIT* I don't know what you did my man, but the game no longer lags. Thank you for keeping to your word, I respect 'dat. Now, as for the Crea, Now that I've had time to sit down and play. It, is really cool xD So many monsters on the surface? Er ma gerd! Different attacks too! I was running away from one dude, and the guy pulled up an ice wall in front of me, I mean wow. Very cool indeed. Im eager to see what some next in this."
280540,GhostControl Inc.,"Getting this game on sale may be the only time to get this game.  With that said I just about experienced all of the game within six hours. The best pull for me, at first, was the busting of Ghosts. Sadly the charm wears off quickly as you realize things peak with better equipment. Any nervousness goes away and not much of a challenge is left. I believe there isn’t much of a game once you hit that point and nothing to really drive towards with all of the bust and making money.  The best part of this game is the art, music, and honestly the humor. I found a lot of it charming and had fun with it for a few hours.  Mostly I would recommend, as is, if the price comes down. If there was an overarching drive for the player to keep going then I’d feel much better about the game and feel it was worth playing the time I spent. "
280560,Danmaku Unlimited 2, Pretty decent vertical shooter.
280600,BloodLust Shadowhunter,"I tend to like Vampire games, but I seriously could not even give this one a full hour before I just got sick of it, I dont know how long I could play it but between the painfully clunky controls and the lack of a solid early plot to drag you into the story I just cant get into it. It reminds me of Morrowind, Here slave your free go do whatever and hope you find some plot.  I will say I love when anyone includes vampires or Fae in there games and that its the work of mostly just one guy is incredible, someone at a big company should hire him fast.  I actually think the game might run better if it had been full on RPG based on something like the old Bioware D&amp;D games, like a planescape torment but with vampires."
280620,Fiesta Online,"good game i can recommend it to everyone who loves anime mmorpgs, although it's kinda out of date"
280640,Dark Shadows - Army of Evil,"This is a good game, but you control the game at all. It has too many Key board key's to remember."
280680,Krita,"Well, I wouldnt recomend this if you're using mouse or just getting started into digital painting.  I honestly wish I had used the demo before buying this straight up.  For someone getting into digital painting straight from using MS paint and MyPaint I thought I could improve and create images like ones shown on the preview section without having to pay the full amount of PhotoShop.  Heres the list of troubles I've had, not just as a mouse user but as a person just getting into digital painting.   - The opening of Krita Gamini is plain and simple, but at first worried me on what to click.  - It would be really nice if they implemented a 'recent brush / preset use' so that if you're testing new brushes about and accidently click on something else that resets the presets back to the top that you can find the brush you were using.  - I've grown used to using the Right mouse to click and drag the canvas around here it actually removes the view of the mouse and does like a 'quick choice' circle full of brushes which I suppose is good if you want to quickly get to the eraser but it completely throws me off.  - I'm finding the layers very hard to get used to.   - The text option works very weirdly and immediatly puts text in at size 20 which makes it 'omg wtf have I done' and its actually kind of hard to work with the text boxes.  I'll probally edit this later on."
280720,Imagine Earth, Early Access Review
280830,Foosball - Street Edition,A good game. Worked for a while then stopped working
280890,GhostshipAftermath,"Unfinished. Lots of glitches and bugs. I exit the first airlock and didn't stopped at the elevator and the game crashed. Objects go through walls and doors, colisions are not always detected. In the current state, I can't recomend it."
280910,T.E.C. 3001,"For the price it's a heck of a lot of fun to roar through the lovely levels at breakneck speed, although I don't think it will last you very long unless you're an obsessive high-score chaser."
280930,Battlepillars Gold Edition,"In my opinion this game has a fairly original concept, and this game can make you satisfied in a special way in that moment when you finish a level and you know that you have struggled to find the right combination that will pay off and then after you finish it is that feeling of glory.  clearly my opinion is that this game has potential and it would be an idea as a multiplayer system to be worked a little better. Plus a few minigames wouldn't hurt but in my opinion it would *population* more the game  The game is the one with the caterpillar-based strategy PvE.  Analyzing the game overall is a good game and its worth all the money."
2810,X3: Reunion,"This game is a addicting, incredibly fun game, but it has a very steep learning curve, and may not be for you if you dont like space games, or trading games."
281060,Reversion - The Meeting,"Super short and super easy game. I played through it twice. First time very camly clicking everything to try to get submerged into the story, didn't work very well. The second time to get all the achievements, after getting 100% of the achievements I only have 2/4 cards (No walkthrough or similar used). 2 cards are yet to drop and there's nothing more to do in the game.  They game is just way too easy, I never happens that you need to stop and think. This game should not be in episodes, it should be one game with all of them, and the price should be what one of the episodes costs, the combined price makes it superexpensive for the little you get.  The female voice actor (english version) is one of the worst I've heared, obviously just some person reading a paper from top to bottom. Might replay it spanish some day to see if it's better since I still have 2 cards to drop...  Edit: Came back to the game, wanted to do a play though in spanish to see if it was better. Turns out that chaning the language to spanish does, NOTHING. everything is still in english, voice actors, menu's etc everything. Validating files, deleting, reinstalling doesn't help, everything still in english even though spanish exists in the language menu and is chosen... both thumbs down!"
281220,BloodRayne: Betrayal (Legacy),"HORRIBLE Game! The trailers I thought it was a 'clone' of Castlevania ... But unfortunately it is not! Ugly and repetitive graphics, few enemies, linear stages, 'smash button' combat system, bad music, imprecision in commands, poor menus and easy bosses . It had everything to be a good game because has millions of references could be used of other games of the same style, but decided to 'innovate in poor shape' cutting the good things, and when copy do this bad. A total waste of money and time.  Jogo HORRÍVEL! Pelos trailers pensei que fosse um 'clone' de Castlevania... Mas infelizmente não é! Graficos feios e repetitivos, poucos inimigos, fases lineares, sistema de combate 'smash button', música ruim, imprecisão nos comandos, chefes fáceis e menus pobres. Tinha tudo pra ser um bom jogo porque tem milhões de referências que poderia usar de outros jogos do mesmo estilo, mas resolveu 'inovar de forma pobre' capando o que tinha de bom, e o pouco que copia faz de forma ruim. Um desperdício total de dinheiro e tempo."
281240,Adventure Chronicles: The Search For Lost Treasure,the graphics were not so good in this game and the game itself was not that good. Not the best and would not recommend it. It just felt cheap and fast.
281260,Desert Gunner,"Even as a fan of turret levels, this was just a drab, boring and tediously difficult game to endure. My itch to beat every game I start has damned me once again.  The AI is atrocious even for their simple, menial existence. The graphics are laughable. The levels are the same boring stretch of highway for 20 missions and the machineguns sound worse then cap-guns and half-inflated whoopie-cushions.  I bought this for 50 cents, and I should have saved it for the vending machine in my workplace breakroom. I can't believe the chaps who made Beachhead crapped out this pre-alpha of a 'Finished' product."
281280,Mashed,"amazing game from my childhood, never knew it was on steam"
281350,US and THEM,"Not a bad concept f the game, however it was very poorly executed. There, are no directions, help or depth to the game. There is no Instructions that tells what it is that you are doing, or what you are trying to achieve. I would not recommend to anybody, espically for $10.   UPDATE: I have just found the game manual and the toutorial video on the store page, It is not a very hard game to play, however there is still no depth or exciting game play. This was a low budget game that tried to make as much money as possible. I still would not recommend it."
281370,Real Horror Stories Ultimate Edition,"Not that scarry, but a good way to pass the time solving riddles."
281390,O.R.B.,"Wow, Clumsy interface. Plan on reading the manual as there is no tutorial and comands are not intuitive. But it does run on Windows 7, and there may be a good game here."
281410,Ubersoldier II,"This game is great for it's low price tag. Although the AI is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tend to do things that any sane human being would never do, it adds a lot to the flawed charm of this game.  I enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it to anyone, as long as they realize that this is not a AAA Game and has its fair share of goofy issues. I'd definitely call it a flawed gem."
281430,Clans,Worth the price
281450,Disciples Sacred Lands Gold,"It desperatly needs an update for more modern machines. Its like playing in windowed mode with it a 4' window, only its set to full screen and outside the 4' is just black. Wouldnt recomend paying money for it unless youre a sucker like the guy typing this"
281560,D.W.A.R.F.S.,"Uggg. Seriuosly, what a horrible experience. The whole time is like, what the hell am I supposed to be doing? Their basic moves, fine simple, I even got a few things done, but then you're just stuck wandering around hoping randomly clicking on things will do something. And there's no help out there. Walkthroughs or videos are non-exsistent, even here on steam. Just don't waste your time."
281580,Wings Over Europe,don't bother with this game..... Your better off getting Strike Fighters 2: Europe or even all 5 SF2 games. Much better mods and has no problems running on newer OS
281610,Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,"Well, i finished the whole game in 12 hours of game time, on hard. Its a fairly short story-line, good but really short. You dont get much bang for your buck. Its a nice attempt to revive the homeworld series but comes out like a command and conquer type game. It has zero replay value and fairly limited options.   At this time I would not recommend paying 50 bucks for it, its not worth it. They should have stuck to a space sim, since thats really where Homeworld really shined."
281640,The Banner Saga 2,"Super awesome game! Great turn based strategy game. The health and damage system is genius. And the traveling aspect is so interesting. The story is very engaging. Overall, great game."
281750,Munin,"After perfecting the game i can only say one thing great game for a good price.  + challenging, but not unbeatable + great setting (fitting music, nice artwork) + easy to learn, hard to perfect, game gets harder at a good pace  - could be a little bit longer - is missing an editor for custom quizes designed by the community "
281820,Explodemon,"Standard 2D plateformer with amusing gameplay mechanics. Not that difficult given the numerous checkpoints throughout the levels and the short duration of the game. For me, not worth returning a second time, even for the achievements. Speaking of which, I still don't get how to S rank a level. I happened to get one randomly, but I replayed level 1-1 about 20 times, killing all ennemies, getting all items (if you miss one, you'd better restart because sometimes you won't be able to go back in the level), having a completion time of 5 mins, always getting a A rank. Oh and the speedrun achievements are very hard too. All in all I wouldn't really recommand this game unless you're a fan of the genre with money to spare."
281840,4PM,"I like story-driven games, the kind that some people don' teven think of as games because there's no 'winning' or 'losing' or even scoring involved. Ever since I played 'Dear Esther' I've been looking for as many first-person, story-driven games as i can find. '4PM' is one of the best I've played in a long time.   The graphics aren't necessariliy great, but they get the job done without getting in the way of the story or gameplay. The voice acting is better than in most games. I especially liked the option of jumping forward to the next part of the game. If you like minigames like trying to sneak out of the office, you can play thtough them. But if you get stuck in them, as I did in that part, it doesn' thave to stop you from reaching the end of the game.   If there were more episodes or chapters of this game, continuing the story, I'd definitely go along for the ride."
281860,RefleX,"Quite simply one of the finest doujin Shmups, but the fact is that many games are better than this one (such as the Donpachi franchise, Radiant Silvergun or Ikaruga).  It's a really good game, but I would ultimately only recommend it to Shmup die-hards who have already played all the big-name games and need even more."
281900,Indie Graphics Bundle,"Aside from missing a few odds and ends this package already contains an impressive assortment of tools for building many types of games. The space/sci fi kit is huge, it also has things like map builders and 'snes looking sprite' character builders. My only complaints are that the game kits are not fully fleshed out, so you will not be able to get 100% of your resources from this.   With that said, just some amateur GIMP/Photoshop skills and this package will keep you busy making custom game content. It all fits togethers like legos. I literally just drag drop things into my layout editor. I really like it, and I'm excited that they will add more.   Massive space set, great quality, lots of animations, ships, parts, backgrounds, etc all look great at 720p  Assortment of things that are not as expansive such as a map builder, rpg icons, some avatars.   The only downside is that things aren't fleshed out. Sprites have walk only animations and the ground builders do not match the art style. Creating these things would take considerable work for an amateur. The space kits has more ships than necessary but lacks some things like icons for common gui elements or space inventory. You still have to get your elbows dirty if you're looking to complete a game.  If you're sick of being uninspired by using your own programmer art, I highly reccommend this. No worries about licensing, and it's very flexible. At least I'm having fun. "
281920,Splatter - Zombiecalypse Now,"Trash-filled, simplistic top-down zombie shooter. Kinda similar to Shadowgrounds, with the storytelling reminiscent of Max Payne.  Graphics glitched out on highest gfx settings, but setting shadows to 2nd best option fixed it.  Got the game for 0,49€ and it's worth every single cent, probably one of the best bangs for bucks I got on Steam so far.  Definitely recommended."
281940,Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries,"I'm genuinely sorry that things didn't work out for this developer. It's clear that a lot of love and attention went into Woolfe, but sadly, it was spent in the wrong areas. At first glance, it's hard to tell why this game didn't do well. In terms of aesthetics, GRIN 100% nailed it with art and environments that suck the player into a unique setting. Regrettably, the praise ends there, as the game's shortcomings become apparant almost immediately. If half as much care and detail went into this game's combat as went into its cosmetics, things might have gone differently. As it stands, though, Woolfe offers poor controls and sloppy, terrible combat in one of the prettiest, shortest games you'll ever play. Woolfe is worth a quick, frustrating playthrough just for the scenery, but taken as a whole, it's difficult to recommend this one."
281990,Stellaris,A good followup to the original Moo2. Avoids many mistakes of previous attemps. 'Real time' but more like turn based in execution. No control of space combat but great control of everything else.
2820,X3: Terran Conflict,"Not a good game, sorry, but it's slow, cumbersome and too hard to navigate the convoluted menu system (just try and transfer something from one ship to another while you are docked, omg), oh and it forgets to tell you important little snippets of information like how close you need to be to scan, or even how you scan? Let alone the totally underpowered startup vessel you get. Now I see why it was so cheap. No real automated noob starting help system, what keys do you press to do anything? dunno, had to go looking."
282010,Carmageddon Max Pack,"It's not that I don't hate the game itself, it's just that it runs on an incredibly buggy emulator that doesn't even work half the time. I shouldn't have to pay ten bucks for an emulator and a rom I could just download for free. It would make more sense if this was an updated port instead of just an emulated game."
282030,Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now,Best Carma Game of All Time .. I had a Voodoo Graphics Card to play this in 3DFX ..
282050,MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,"game needs to be fixed, I have had reflex for a while and wanted this bc I figured it would be an improvement on some of the issues with reflex but the graphics are actually worse on the lowest settings which i have to use just to get the game to run. the min. requirements are a joke.  mine: athlon II x 4 @ 3ghz gtx 660ti 4gb ram 40 fps max on lowest settings  friend: 8 core gtx 970 16gb ram 40 fps on max settings "
282070,This War of Mine,"It starts of original and fresh, very dark and a good challenge but sadly for me, to keep alive having to do every chore just becomes soooo boring and mundane, for that reason eventually I gave up on it.....the basics should be optional"
282100,Fearless Fantasy,FUN game.. recommended..
282140,SOMA,Really great game. Scare you sometimes and introduce you in a new ways to what to think about A.I. Just an amazing game!
282210,Sid Meier's Starships,"Very good game. Not the classical one what i waited from Sid, but when you have limited time it's perferct to relax."
282350,NBA 2K15,"Do not buy this game or any 2K game for that matter unless you plan to buy them every year. Server support was dropped for this game with no warning. My player that I spent 144 hours trying to max out is now gone. I was going to play a lot over New Year's holiday, only to be met with the message that I could not connect to the online servers. If you search around, this is not an uncommon problem to have due to crummy support, but then found a tweet from their @2KSupport 'reminding us' that the NBA 2k15 servers will be discontinued after today. Therefore, this game is now trash. It was pretty fun to play, but it would be a complete waste of money now, even on sale.  Proof:  https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/5lbs2k/reminder_nba_2k15_servers_will_be_discontinued/#bottom-comments "
282440,Quake Live,"It's got a tough learning curve, but it's very fast paced and easy to jump in/out of. Overall a good game."
282530,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate HD,"If you are looking for a very solid adventure platform with a decent story, then this game is for you. The combat is solid and it feels great to fight giant enemies. The story is well written, and theres very little to complain about.   Pros: Solid Combat Decent Graphics Great sound track and in-game atmosphere Difficult enemies Great exploration rewards  Cons: None that I can think of!"
282560,RollerCoaster Tycoon World,"What on earth is this game. It is TERRIBLE. I bought this as I played the original roller coaster tycoon and this is SO much worse. They always talk about 'peeps' as well... mate, stop calling everyone PEEPS it does my f*cking nut in."
282590,Star Ruler 2,"It's a totally ligit stratagy game. (real time with a pause button, think CK2) can make your own spaceships witch is super fun, and should be a classic 4x game"
282620,The Battle of Sol,"This game is better than I thought is was going to be.The play is smooth and the graphics are great.The interface is well designed and thought out.The ships look cool and fly like a dream.It has a good storyline.If your into Space simulations I think you will enjoy it.I have not played as much as I'd like because of not having the time, But this is one I will play a lot when I get the chance."
282640,LOST ORBIT,"EDIT: I'm changing my thumbs down cause the game deserves some credit. Although very short, it's a lot of fun to play while enjoying the amazing soundtrack. I'd recommend getting on a sale bacause it's really not very long at all. Original review below still applies: Don't get it for mac!!! Seems kindda fun though"
282660,Easy eSports,the instruction at 0x00000000015F2DA8 referenced memory at 0x00000000015F2DA8. the memory could not be read. need helppppp
282680,Warring States, Early Access Review
282740,Organic Panic, Early Access Review
282760,Circuits,   Listen carefully now   
282780,Stick 'Em Up 2,Very good game. 6/10 I recommend this game because it has good quality graphics xD and i rated 6 because it can be laggy if too many things are happening at one time. I have a trash computer.
282800,100% Orange Juice,"A great game with a very friendly community, it keeps gets getting updated on a regular basis with new content despite having been released years ago. It offerss easy to grasp strategic gameplay, yet it's not too serious. It's easy to find multiplayer lobbies, and it's possible to join ongoing games. "
282860,Masterspace,"The new gravity mechanics are awful, and basically just add a requirement when building spaceships. Without gravity, a spaceship is completely unflyable because you can't stay on the floor, which means that if you get into a spaceship without one and fly up, you'll lose control of it and not be able to land it.  Because of this, my main game, which had been saved while in space, couldn't be played any longer. As soon as I loaded it, my character floated off the floor and couldn't take control of the ship. I lost a ton of progress. Also if you saved on an asteroid, you're similarly out of luck, because one jump sends you off into space. In the end, all this update did was add a requirement and break some people's saved games.  On top of that, world generation takes a ridiculously long time even though the whole star system is smaller than a small fraction of other voxel based games that load lightning fast. Having too many planets makes the system impossible to play, though I'm not sure why that would make a difference since any competent code would only be loading the planet that you are currently on. It's pretty obvious that the programmer does not know what he's doing.  Additionally, the game freezes for about 10 seconds seemingly at random.  Also turrets are completely useless since if an enemy gets behind something of yours, including the house or ship that the turret is on, it will shoot right through it. I had a turret destroy my spaceship while trying to kill a snake."
282880,FaeVerse Alchemy,   Early Access Review
282900,Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1,game is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad lmao. literally everything from the artwork to the voice acting to the 'gameplay' to the 'story' is just ♥♥♥♥ing unbearable. only reason it has even 1 positive review is because pedo weeaboos like looking at half naked prepubescent girls
283000,Strategic War in Europe,"I finished the game with both sides, almost at first try (it's a simple gaame). Nice 2D graphics, many bugs, simple game mechanics. If you're looking for a game with some depth or difficulty, look elsewhere. If you're new to the genre and find it for 1$ or less, maybe."
283020,The Campaign Series: Fall Weiss,"Before I could not find a way to play all the same in this miracle, I wrote terribly aggressive comment that this is not a game, but, sorry, Sh.it, in which you cant play. So, this is partly true. To play for the USSR is at all unrealistic. Just  forget it. You cant play for the Russian. About Poland.. I did not play and not going to play, I had enough of the time, when I played for Germany. To understand what to do and especially HOW to do very.. very difficult. I cant imagine how such a strategy even came out. Buy? No. On the cards you dont get benefit because they cost about 0.08$, fun gameplay is not observed."
283040,Paper Dungeons,"This game is complete crap.   I just played a game where every move did damage to you. No fighting, just half your damage gone for moving one space, then the other half gone for moving another space. Dead in two moves is pathetic.   Moving should not do damage to the player, and with perma death, what a waste of time!  DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!"
283060,Lucent Heart,"This game takes no effort to exite the player when starting the game. No one likes to sit and read tons of dialogue for quests and a lot of rpg games make the same mistake. The other thing that bothers me about this game, although not a BIG deal, is that as far as I can tell, you can't resize the screen.  Don't get me wrong, graphics have nothing to do with making a good game so I don't care about that."
283080,Super Chibi Knight,I want a refund this game is horrible
283160,House of the Dying Sun,"This game is fun and is very easy to learn. Although the story is short, you can do the bonus challenges which increase the difficulty. There isn't very much flexibility in its fleet building and contains very few ship types for you to use, And if you unlock a ship, it stays with you forever (unless you restart the game i assume). This game is very fun to play but it would be great if the developers could make you be able to make your own fleet, because it would be really cool if i could exchange the capital ships into multiple interceptors so i could have some cool dogfighting gameplay. This game has very few bugs but hopefully in the future they could add more weapon and ship types. If you are interested in piloting one of the fighter ships in a space battle, and want a (very) simplified Homeworld style rts game then this may be the game for you."
283180,The Samaritan Paradox,"Very good AGS game. Some of the puzzles are just a pixel hunt, but fun nonetheless."
283230,Spoiler Alert,10 out of 10 would reverse time again.
283270,Jagged Alliance Gold,"Definately a purchase for those who have fond memories of this game! Youngsters need not apply, as there's no multiplayer you'd be disappointed!"
283290,Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi,"This game is great, it has great atmosphere, intense gameplay(especially when you hear the sound of something coming), and also jump scares. The old graphics also adds bit of creepiness to the game.  "
283310,Soulbringer,"  Great game, definitely giving that old RPG feeling.the older graphics are not really that bad and the music is actually pretty good."
283330,Desert Thunder,"  this game is most likely the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game you can get on steam, no where near worth $10 not even $0.99 why is it bad you might ask? well....  the visuals are very outdated  the gameplay is BORING as all hell (drive here shoot that, drive here shoot this, rense and repeat)  missions are very repetitive (again drive here shoot there, drive there shoot here)  the tank doesn't even look like a tank, looks like a box with tracks that don't even work right  difficulty is all over the place and not balanced at all, some areas are easy and some are just annoying (in the same mission most of the time)  the resolution doesn't even support a modern monitor  lets just put it this way, i got the game FREE and i feel robbed."
283350,Eurofighter Typhoon,"Game works with some extra work. Here is the demo:   https://youtu.be/OVXrhYXjSSQ   Looks pretty good to me.  Here is the 2nd part of the first tutorial with landing:   https://youtu.be/p4WWYCLpFAs   What you need to do is: 1) Double-click the reg file from the game folder (must) 2) Run config3dr2000.exe (optional) 3) Right-click on the game in library list and select create a shortcut to your desktop 4) Run from the shortcut (must)  Note about shortcuts: If you use shortcut created by Steam, it runs is Windows 98 compatibility mode. If you make your own shortcut, you can set to any compatibility mode but you need to make sure you have admin rights and take ownership of the folder first. Steam shortcut tracks your game time but your own shortcut can be set to Windows 2000 mode or higher and runs better without Steam.  Offline mode is problematic. You need to run the game twice without exiting the first one. The first one will be dormant in memory but clicking the shorcut again will run the game. When online you only need to click once.  Now on to more pertinent points about the game itself. Dynamic campaign runs in real-time on it's own time not on demand but you can speed-up, slowdown or pause. Missions are generated on the fly depending on who you choose as your squadmates. For example if you chose more Air-to-Air specialists then your missions will be more about dogfights rather than bombing missions. That's what the manual says anyway, haven't played enough to verify though. You can switch between pilots or let the AI do the job while you watch as spectator, this is true.  I haven't played much but i think this should be good because you can give orders to your wingmen and you can switch over to flying as them much like in Air Conflicts: Vietnam. Only thing that seems to be lacking are rudder controls and countermeasures. Landing is a bit difficult without rudder control though still doable. I landed on the first attempt and pass. Mouse flight doesn't seem to work. Keyboard control is a little rough but usable.  Finally there is a tutorial, so no excuse to not knowing how to fly.  Definitely worth it at 90% off. This is a gem. I suppose gems come as a rough rock at first then you need to cut and polish it to a shine."
283370,Marine Sharpshooter II: Jungle Warfare,"Spacebar takes a screenshot,Not responging after the first dumb cutscene. 0/10"
283390,Incoming Forces,NOTE: This game is a collection of original INCOMING and INCOMING FORCES.  I recommend the original INCOMING. Because it's my first PC game.
283410,CT Special Forces: Fire for Effect,"Okay, this game most certainly does not deserve the incredibly negative reception it's gotten. For an indie (yes, it is an independent developer, regardless of some peoples' weird ideas of indie) studio without a triple A budget, this is a solid, fun, bug-free exercise in tactical shooting."
283430,Litil Divil,i stomped all the spiders but i couldnt stomp the dperession i got from this game
283470,The Secret Of Hildegards,"Though overall nicely drawn, the hidden object puzzles are a pain in the ****. Some items can't be found because they are either obscured by an other item or just too plain dark/mushy/otherwise unrecognizable. It lacks voice acting and in my opinion lacks some atmosphere, not really recommended as is..."
283490,Ihf Handball Challenge 12,"The graphics are dated, but for the only handball game out there it is a great buy for the sport lover. I have heard of the game before while living in Europe, but never understood it. This game is light hearted fun, and I have enjoyed playing and will for some time to come. If you are looking for something like Madden or 2k Sports depth and quality you will be disapointed. However, if you just want to have a little fun playing a sports game that is a little different, this is the one to get. I look forawrd to playing it a little more over the coming weeks."
283580,New York Bus Simulator,"Whatever you do don't buy this game. It's a total scam that will take forever to downlaoad, even if you have a beast computer. It also has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, terrible control schemes, and is overall trash. I used to like sim games until I played this and it has ruined the entire genre for me; so whatever you do DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
283640,Salt and Sanctuary,"This is 'Dark Souls' meets 'Castlevania: Symphony of the Night'. The battle mechanics, gear upgrade system, character progression, lore presentation, grim-dark aesthetics, and the difficult-yet-fair game play are all there, but they are placed in a two-dimentional platformer environment. The game isn't perfect, due to a few odd bugs here and there, but it's nothing game breaking.   With Salt and Sanctuary, these small budget indie developers have done something that the multi-million dollar 'triple-A' gaming companies have been unable to do: create a game that *feels* like it belongs in the Dark Souls game franchise, along with Demon's Soul and BloodBorne. It's amazing, and well worth looking into if you are a fan of that series."
283660,Rabbit Hole 3D: Steam Edition,THIS GAME IS THE PINNACLE OF STEAM. PRAISE ALICE AND THE RABBITS HOLE.
283680,Astebreed: Definitive Edition,"I love bullet hell games, probably number 5 of my favorite kind of games. The sad part of it, is that you can't save. Because I would really like to finish the game, but I don't want to keep replaying the same levels over and over again. Then again, it is an arcade game so I can see why you can't save. I really enjoy this game for the looks and the mechs used in the game."
283820,KAMUI,Dime a dozen little arcadia spaceship shoot'em up.  Nothing is awesome.  Jamestown is better.
283840,ALLTYNEX Second,"After 11 minutes, I can say.... I'm done."
283880,Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok,"The game has way too many 'time fillers'. There are lots of dialogs that are simply way longer than they need to, characters talking useless stuff that do not bring anything to the game or the story. There are also many screens that have nothing to do and just consume even more time while once again bringing nothing to the game.  Sadly all this feels artificially slow and therefore very annoying.   "
283920,Putt-Putt Joins the Parade,My kids like this and there isn't even any candy at the parade.
283940,Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds,Great game from childhood. No doubt a defining title in the genre.
283960,Pajama Sam in No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside,where do i begin i got one thing to say if you have never played pajama sam your child hood was not that lit.One thing this game is good i mean you could argue and say that its not becasue you were playing like doom or team fortress classic when i was a kid i loved this game and i still to this day love it i never get bored of it considering that there are so many.And each one has a wacky intresting story to tell and considering the abiltiy to speed run the game thats the best part but in my opinion you can speed run it but i say play through this slowly and enjoy it the story in each one is just so great but this one i played it i start it up and instantly i got a smile on my face it just feels so rewarding to play to me the pajama sam franchise will never be greater then any thing else in my opinion.
283980,SPY Fox in: Dry Cereal,"This game is literally unplayable. The resolution is a travisty, the viewport is shifted to the left, so there's a giant black bar where the content should be, it's zoomed in way to much, and the mouse support is terrible. You are all better off playing this on the old Gateway you had when you were 5. This game is NOT for new computers, it lacks any sort of hardware support."
2840,X: Beyond the Frontier,"First you fly to the energy plant and buy some energy! Then you fly it to the flower farm and sell it to buy flowers! Then you fly them to the oil refinery and sell them to buy oil! Then you fly to the laser forge, and gaze wistfully at the basic bottom-of-the-range laser that you might maybe be able to buy in another six to ten hours! Never has long haul trucking in space been so rendered in so many shades of dirty mud brown.   'This game has [...] graphics! ' - Greg"
284000,Putt-Putt and Pep's Balloon-o-Rama,"  I never thought there could be a perfect game until after playing this gem. At first I thought this would be just a joke gift from my friend, but boy was I wrong. The art is beautiful, and the character development and story throughout the game is tear jerking at some points for all Putt-Putt and his dog Pep go through. This game gets a solid 10/10 from me without a doubt, no better game out there than this."
284020,Freddi Fish and Luther's Maze Madness,"Nostalgia rush. This game is just plain awesome and still has more legitimate elements of game design than are expected from most modern game developers. Levels and puzzles are engaging and making your own levels makes for tons of replayability and serious fun. In my eyes, a masterpiece. :D"
284050,Sanitarium,"Game is old and ugly, character movement is slow and janky, and the voice acting veers into absurdity as often as possible.   Still love it. Part of it is nostalgia, certainly, but the atmosphere is legitimately creepy, and the story itself holds up pretty well. The Aztec stuff is sort of cheap and is easily the least entertaining part of the game, but aside from that, there's little to complain about in terms of level design choice. You won't have a hard time with much in the way of puzzles; it's definitely not a Mensa test.   You can breeze through this story in less than 10 hours, easily, and will enjoy it the whole time. Especially if you're a fan of point-and-clicks."
284100,Unclaimed World, Early Access Review
284160,BeamNG.drive, Early Access Review
284180,Magicians & Looters,"The game itself feels unimpressive. The graphics seem unpolished, the dialogue is childish, and the gameplay itself is simple and not very exciting. Overall, the game seems like it brings nothing new to the genre, and isn't very fun to play."
284200,Robot Rescue Revolution,"I love puzzle games and Robot Rescue Revolution is a refreshing take on a classic genre. There are a lot of levels to beat and the game definitely gives you a challenge. I consider myself to be decent at puzzle games but this game is just brutally hard. Levels can take a very long time, over 10 minutes even if you play perfectly and sometimes a single mistake earlier in the level can destroy your chances of beating the game. The mechanics allow for very confusing things such as cloning your characters (who all move at once) so it's sometimes very hard to have any idea how to beat the level.  I recommend this game to anyone who loves playing puzzle games. If you're good at those, even better."
284220,Diadra Empty,Is it a new trend to release crappy games with crappy controls? Don't touch this piece of crap even with a long stick.
284260,PANORAMICAL,"It's a somewhat short but very beautiful game, I played around with all of the different options in every single scene just to see what they did. I had a great time creating awesome scenes, many of which I screenshotted and use as backgrounds. The sound used in each scene was very well composed, although some combinations of adjustments can cause clashing in the notes and tempo. Overall a wonderful experience."
284290,Farm Machines Championships 2014,This game is not good. Poorly optimized. Unplayable at some points. Would not buy again.
284390,The Last Door - Collector's Edition,"Before I review this game, I'd like to give information about myself (the reviewer) first. I've been playing point &amp; click games since 1990 on Commodore64, Amiga, PC and own quite a large collection.   The product review is for the first season game, which I've played from the beginning to the end.  Visual: While most of you may not like the pixel graphics, I did like them in the game. It didn't bother me at all and actually I was quite impressed as to how much detail you can see in the pixel art itself. If you played one of the old Lucas Arts series in the early 90s before and you loved it, you'll love this one too. The effort of detail and coloured contrast they put in, gives it a beautiful realistic look, but yet it preserves the feel of a retro classic point &amp; click game.  Audio: High quality stereo sound, the sound fx are moving from one ear to another as you're moving your character. The music gives also the atmosphere of a 'creepy' game, since it's been designed to be a little scary. Melodies / music are somewhat similar to what you would expect in an old-fashioned horror movie. There are no character voices, just pure background music and sound effects.  Game Control: quite good. There is no 'push, pull, take, use...' etc. It's simply point &amp; click. Try out a few cominations from your inventory with objects in the game. No keyboard use, just mouse.   Story: captivating. I really liked the story, making me want to finish the game and also play the next season. I won't go into the story on this occasion, as obviously I don't want to spoil anything. Also the reading involved in the game is not too much in comparison to some other p&amp;c games, where you mostly skip dialogs because it's somewhat useless information or boring. Note, there are very little puzzles in the game! Puzzles are more towards the end, but they are easily solved.   If you have a slight interest in this point &amp; click game / adventure, I highly recommend it."
284410,Cornerstone: The Song Of Tyrim,"If you take Wind Waker and remove everything that made it great, you've got Cornerstone. It's an interesting mix of wasted potential, bugs and blandness. That's not to say it's a terrible game, but it is a very mediocre and uninteresting game. Definitely one for the bargain bin."
284460,DeadCore,"I love this game. its challenging, exceptionally unique. beautiful, addicting.  Theres no story or anything but the game is an arcade-ish action puzzle adventure, where you must climb to the top of the mysterious tower.  I have not finished the game but so far its absolutely fantastic. Would highly reccomend"
284580,ZAMB! Biomutant Extermination,Played this during early access. Thought it was a nice idea and enjoyed it.
284680,Tremor,"This program has so far done what I've wanted. I'm not a big music guy, to be honest I'm not even sure what every button on the screen does. But what I wanted was a machine that I could use to make rythem paterns and to tweak the notes till they sounded just right. I wanted something mostly simple to use and so far this has worked.   However I will warn you, if you are thinking this will easily make you a master of synth, it will not. And the support for it isnt all that great. There is some technical trial and error I had to go through but I was able to figure it out with the help of a community member from here. So in the end I will recoemdn it in that it does what it says it will."
284710,Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden,"Abyss: The Waiths of Eden is an enjoyable hidden object / puzzle game. The story is interesting. The puzzles range from easy to difficult. The only things I didn't care for were the super creepy 3D models of the people, especially when they were in my face talking to me. Yikes! All in all though, a nice way to spend 5.5 hours."
284730,Dark Arcana: The Carnival,This one was a twisted one but in a good way. Short if you know how these games go. Interesting puzzles and sureal setting. Definately worth buying.
284750,Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek,"A good hidden object game with some decent and unique puzzles. I liked the game, took a few hours (about half my play time was AFK)"
284770,Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood," Interim review:   + Usual Artifex Mundi quality, amazing graphics and sounds + Exciting, cinematic cutscenes + Classic HOPA gameplay, very player friendly, optional hints, and 3 difficulty modes  - Way more jumpscares than in any other HOPA game I've played. It feels like they are trying a bit  too  hard to make the game exciting. Devs, people don't play HOPA games to have heart attacks, ease up on the thriller factor :)"
284790,Nightmares from the Deep 2: The Siren`s Call,"Gameplay and artwork are ok, though not spectacular, but the story is incredibly cliché. It was completely predictable from the start, and every new 'revelation' just bored me even more.  At the end of the game I was like 'finally!', then I saw the bonus content, sighed, and uninstalled."
284810,Nightmares from the Deep 3: Davy Jones,And another good HOG.
284830,Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink,"The game was interesting, hard but not too much so, and the animation was quite cool. The steampunk style won me over."
284870,9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek,I have to admit I was a not sure what to expect from this game when I started. But I was quite pleased with what I got.  The mix of puzzles and mini games kept me amused for 4 hours. And the story is quite decent giving you a guide of why you are doing those puzzles.
284890,Left in the Dark: No One on Board,"A relaxed, easy way to kill some time.  This story had great potential, but left tons of unresolved loose ends. A sequel or a rewrite that explores that would be fantastic.   Absolute highlight: Opening a door with a shark!"
284910,Purgatory: War of the Damned, Early Access Review
284930,Speed Kills,"Fun, but abandoned game. A shame. Do NOT pay ANY money for this.  Usually I'm the first to defend a developer who's not making regular updates on things, but in cases such as this? The developer doesn't react to inquiries or anything. There are quite some issues and bugs that need attention...for over 2 years now.   Due to this I will avoid saying anything more about the game itself. Next thing I'm gonna is try to contact the publisher, they usually have an open ear. If there's no substantial update in 2017, don't bother looking any further into this...unless you'd like to try make some pressure on the dev or something."
284950,Pixel Puzzles: Japan,"more picts, maybe a way to add own picts."
284970,Project Root,"Project Root is sort of an open-area arcade shooter that feels like it came from the 90's. I was enticed by what I saw, bought it on sale, and merrily jumped in. 20-ish hours later (which was in Offline Mode and thus not displayed here), I was done waiting for it to become worth my time OR money. It's got a good arcade-y feel to it, the objectives are (most of the time) clearly marked, and the game DOES work as intended. HOWEVER....it is heavily marred, and I shall focus on those details.  The English is sloppy. Even one as pedantic as I can forgive the occasional mistake, but this is pre-high-school level, and it grates on me. Some of this is presented in pre- or post-mission cutscenes that alternate between two ugly character stills and an uninteresting story poorly presented through text. The rest of this mess is given by all the text frequently sprawled across the bottom during the action. This is distracting at best, and often meant I had to back away from all combat to catch what was going on before the text rapidly vanished.  And the controls....I don't know about keyboard/mouse, but I played this on a controller, and it was not fun. There is never a need to stop shooting. You should be shooting during the majority of the time. You need to be holding down a button to shoot. These missions are upwards of 20 minutes each. That makes 20 minutes or more of holding down a button more-or-less constantly, which gets uncomfortable, and the ensuing cramps disuaded me from that third mission in a sitting.  But what about aside from that, what about the gameplay? Well, there are upgrades! Upgrades that don't necessarily explain what they do. 'Elite kit: Rockets' doesn't tell me much. And these felt minor, easily forgettable, and like the points on 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?'... didn't really matter. Honestly, the game should've just left out the upgrades altogether.  The view feels too zoomed in. If you want to avoid getting shot from off-screen or rushing past an enemy nearly as soon as it appears, you need to keep your eyes OFF of the scenery and on your mini-map. The shooting and the dodging just don't feel GOOD this way.  Now, some of you may like the idea of infinitely respawning enemies. Keep the pressure on as you go for the objectives, right? Well even that just feels clumsily done in Project Root. I found one of the spawn points. A ship appearing in air right in front of me, and another instantly appearing right in front of me as its predecessor died in fire. I should not have been able to see that. That aside, the constant enemy spawns are just an aggravating nuisance during the boss fights, which go on too long anyway.  This game's graphics and settings are also subpar. It felt a little sluggish on my quite-decent machine, despite not looking the part of a modern game. Reducing the graphics settings yielded a result, and smooth play...but the distant background went from fog to black abyss. A black abyss that sometimes swallowed or spit back out varioius terrain features of this background layer, based on which direction I was facing. There's a difference between giving a game a more basic graphical style, and just poorly-executing your visuals.  In short, if you want a budget version of a modern-day imagination of an older-style shoot-em-up that has a very open area, you could probably do worse than Project Root. There's a gulf, however, in between that and a recommendation from me. That gulf is hidden in a glitchy black abyss."
284990,Solarix,"100% not worth $20. You can't walk when crouched on stairs, it has a very indie game feel about it (unpolished.) I didn't play too into the storyline so I can't give you a review on that.  Edit: Alright a lot of people are giving me complaints about not 'playing it long enough' but honestly how long of the game do I have to play to say 'It's not for me.' The game is stupid buggy, you get stuck in random places and if you shoot at an enemy and watch him shoot back his gun disappears and he dances. The 'rain effect' is straight out of 1990's along with half the graphics, and the mechanics are so far terrible. So here is my 2nd review after playing another 18 mins, it's terrible and not worth $20. Had I spent $5 on the game I might have said 'Eh pick it up see if you like it.' but it's a 20$ game, I expect to be able to play it more than 30 mins and be entertained."
2850,X-Tension,A very good game. Gets you started and updated to understand the complexities of the games after X Tension
285010,Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ,"Nice game, if you wanna waste some time. There is one special achievement... :D"
285050,Showtime!," Rating:   3/10   Paid:   NZ$2.51  (Refunded)  Review:   When I purchased this game, I was hoping it was similar to The Movies. I was quite wrong.  I know it's a cheap little indie game, but I found it boring. When you create a save, you are immediately put to work, coming up with a movie. You hire actors and actresses, directors and staff. Then you wait for something because you can't continue until something happens? I don't get what I'm waiting for because the game makes it confusing. At this point I decide that I'm bored, I've just wasted 10 minutes of my time and I want a refund.  So I got that refund and now I'm leaving a review on this game to tell you why I wouldn't recommend it, but honestly, it's up to you what you want to do with your money. If you want to spend it on this game then I can't stop you."
285070,Between Me and The Night,"I dont really know what to say... I dont see the point of buying that game, i mean its ok you can play it, but whats the point on playing it? You can play it once and then it's boring because you know everything... If you like those kind of games buy it and if you want something you can play every day and a long time, you should buy other games. I kinda like it, because I've mostly palyed survival games or shooter :D"
285110,GearCity, Early Access Review
285130,Battleplan: American Civil War,Bought and downloaded this game with great excitment only to have it contiously sfreeze at the load screen. I have had this game for 3 or 4 days now and have yet to be able to play it.
285160,LEGO® The Hobbit™,I beat the game. Good game but pretty weird that it only goes 2/3 through the story... :(
285310,RollerCoaster Tycoon: Deluxe,Simple. Fun. Nostalgic. Definitely worth it during a Steam Sale.
285330,RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Triple Thrill Pack,Very entertaining. Always something to do.
285350,Kingdom Elemental,"Potential - YES! Realization - well, no... Narrator is great (with his comments about the storyline and breaking the fourt wall) and concept is simple and (mostly) fun, but... The game is way too buggy and unpolished, controls are clumsy (maybe it would be better without controlling units?) and graphics is really ugly. But I give this game thumbs up, because I like it.  This game (really) deserves an overhaul, or a fine sequel. Support the devs, go on Kickstarter or whatever, just give this type of game a chance to shine. Oh, and a fine multiplayer...please?"
285420,Deadly Sin 2,"It's pretty much what I expected from an RPG maker style game. Since I like those kinds of games, I don't mind the predictability of the fighting, story, etc. I'm only six hours in, so maybe that assessment is premature. The only thing I really don't like, is that the key mapping can't be reconfigured. After an hour or so, I got used to the layout."
285440,Crimzon Clover  WORLD IGNITION,I like the main menu music
285480,The Entente Gold,"This game is literally ♥♥♥ checks, you can't even play the game. I had to sit in the main menu screen for 5 mins to write this review. I couldn't even play the game becuase right once the game opens you can't move the mouse but the game crashes. Don't buy this game."

285520,Sledgehammer / Gear Grinder,"Sledgehammer (aka Gear Grinder) is one of those weird games that can only come out of Russia... in a parallel future, where trucks can transform from jet-engined superracer into an armored and heavily armed beast, and police are packed with gatling guns and more and enforce laws with lethal force, you have been executed for slaughtering innocents with your truck, but you woke up mysteriously next to a shiny new transforming truck... and was told to get through some training so you can undergo some missions for this mysterious benefactor...   Basically you drive around like some weird vigilante who needs to cause maximum destruction. You have front bumper spikes, side spinning saws (later), front firing weapons (primary and secondary), and rear mine dispensers. Your truck can also be upgraded with better armor, transmission, engine, and so on.   The fighting is about what you'd expect in such a game... You are in 3rd person but very low, so your truck will obstruct your view ahead. Fortunately you can pretty much run through almost anything in your way, or your shoot your way through. There are missions that are pure racing (where you use racing mode, complete with afterburning engines) pure combat (survive arena for X seconds), or run-n-gun (fight enemies as you try to make it through checkpoints). The more you kill the more time on the clock you get, but the the more damage you suffer. There are a few oddball missions such as 'pilot a RC bomb drone' or 'max speed into a cafe'.   The problem is the first level's 'end mission'. Instead of a boss fight, you're basically put into a gauntlet that's basically 3 missions together. First is a checkpoint race where you need to pass through little tokens to get extra time. When you reach a mall you crash through to land and found the way's blocked, and you need to kill X police cars to get out. Then it's a long run-n-gun to the final endpoint... where I've tried about 10 times, with max upgrades, and I keep running out of time (the only way to gain time is kill the cops, and they sometimes aren't fast enough so you can't kill them (or I'm taking too many go-fast upgrades?!) So I can't even get onto 'level 2' (i.e. next city).   Voiceover is atrocious, storyline is outrageous, sound is... mediocre. Graphics are tolerable. This is a weird game. If you like your idea of wanton destruction, give it a try. But not quite my cup of tea."
285580,ACE - Arena: Cyber Evolution, Early Access Review
285670,Galactic Command Echo Squad SE,"Derek Smart makes the best Space Sims, ignore the hater kids that won't read the manual.....Just 'SHAKE IT OFF' like Taylor Swift says :)  'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake I shake it off, I shake it off"
285740,Kitty Powers' Matchmaker,"The game is very good, although I got bored of it after level 14, it's still okay to play every now and then."
285800,Braveland,"Braveland is a fun game that I would reccomend if it was not so short. I beat it from start to finish in about 5 hours and dont see much value in replaying it. 5dollars for 5hours may be better value than going to the movies, but it is one of the worst ratios of all my computer games."
285820,Action Henk,prepare to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. this isnt exacatly accurate physics. dont understand how i can be doing the exact same this as the shadow of the same character and still fall behind. even on flat gound when doing only running. lots of fun in the begining. winning gold or rainbow on all the first 20-30 lvls then all of a sudden i cant even get silver? making a course seems a little tedius constantly having to test it out after every block. and for such a simple game it sure it resource hungry. makes the cpu and gpu run so hot!
285840,Enemy Mind,  Enemy mind is really good. But it is also REALLY hard and that why I wont play it again. Its graphics are nice and give you a retro feeling but i can only pass the first stage. I wouldnt recommend this game unless you are really good at these types of games. 6/10
285900,Gang Beasts, Early Access Review
285920,TerraTech, Early Access Review
285960,Q*bert: Rebooted,"As someone who had never played Q*bert before despite having been into video games since the day I dug up an old ZX-Spectrum clone from a local pile of trash as a poor and clueless little kid, let me tell you:  Q*bert is  fun , concise and unique, and this version  does not  prevent it from being fun, concise and unique.  There seems to be a lot of negativity surrounding this release. From the overall sentiment it might seem that it's best to avoid it altogether saying, hey, maybe I'll come across one of those arcade cabinets some day that have that rumoured 'proper' Q*bert!  Maybe. Some day.  The criticism may be fully justified. The controls may not work well (though I have not experienced any problems on the keyboard), the port of the classic mode may not be top notch (though I have no complaints), and there may be some bugs in the 'rebooted' mode with the campaign (which I have not met), but let me tell you: it's  still  fun!  I do hope too that the game gets a better re-release that every Q*bert afficionado would be happy with, but as it stands, this is a perfectly playable version of Q*bert that anyone interested in arcade/puzzle games or video game history who wants to know what Q*bert was about will likely enjoy. Especially with such a price tag."
285980,Kromaia,"What a great space game in the first levels but what a terrible last section. 'I know, let's make our spaceship a swordfighting game all of a sudden,' thought the devs. Each of the four sections changes your weapons to be worse than the previous section.  So it's a great game. Except fot the last level. And the crappy weapons. You literally have to dive into a gun barrel and slash your spaceship sword and hope that the timing of their bullets isn't going to kill you. All while dodging bullets from another gun that you can't kill for no reason. And then if you manage to get past that, you can attempt to kill the boss, but they're going to shoot bullets at you faster than you can dodge or swordfight. I don't play games that rely on luck and you shouldn't either. That being said, I think this dev can make a good spaceship game, just stop trying to impress us and make it fun with what you already have that is awesome.  "
286040,Dead Effect,You know it isn'tthat all bad for a 5 dollar price tag but there Iis a few things to note the voice acting and some animations are clunky other than that it'sa ooveralldecent game
286100,You Have to Win the Game,Pfft... Not even going to waste my time. The 'Couldn't see it any other way' part made me uninstall. I played this a year ago and was reminded why I uninstalled it. Like the retro style though.
286120,QuestRun," Tl;dr :  It would be a fun little free flash game, but lacks any semblance of depth or replayability.  QuestRun is a mobile game that was ported to Steam, I went into the game knowing as much, so I wasn't expecting a full-fledged mini RPG or anything. With that said, the game still lacks depth and ends up playing like a simple flash game. The entire experience completely depends on how much the RNG gods grace you with team-comp, item drops, and hits/misses. For the most part you just spend your time switching between your 3 characters and pressing their single skill button as soon as it's done charging. The best way I can describe it is kind of like Clicker Heroes without any clicking."
286140,Eidolon,Best mushroom collecting simulator!
286160,Tabletop Simulator,"This is a really great game. I pretty much only use it for tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder/DnD but it is very solid for that. The level of simulation and organization possible with the game itself coupled with the workshop items people have made (check my subscriptions if you like) is simply astounding. Very high quality work, worth the money, and I will continue using it for some time to come."
286200,ReignMaker,Town-building/puzzle hybrid. Can be challenging.
286220,Pier Solar and the Great Architects,pretty good game i like it allot its pretty basic but it was fun enough for me to play through.
286240,Dog Sled Saga,"A cute little game about managing dogs and racing with them. There's editions for App Stores for a lower price, so if you're really cheap you could wait for a sale to snag them up; it's worth the wait."
286260,fault - milestone one,"The story is really good. The game has an encyclopedia and a MASSIVE info-dump at the start, but soon settles down. I looked at the encyclopedia out of curiosity but didn't feel it was ever needed to understand the story or what was going on. After the initial lore-shock, the game does a great job at introducing new concepts, expanding the world and this is all down to the writing which is thought-provoking and very well done.  The visuals are great though some backgrounds looks a little off, like the trees in the forest at night. The music is good but I found it to be a little forgettable. All in all, it's a memorable VN, that took roughly 5 hours to complete and was, in my eyes, totally worth it.  Though a couple of minor issues. No voice acting, the story still got me emotional without them, but it would have been nice. The auto-mode wasn't fast enough either, even on max, so I was clicking my way through. I found it difficult to identify the speaker at times. Some characters are introduced at the start and never mentioned again, maybe they appear in milestone 2? Oh and the secret achievements are really weird, so I'm glad there was a guide.  The biggest problem however is the ending to this milestone, which is a sudden and frankly evil cliff-hanger. This isn't as bad for me who owns both halves and can load up milestone 2 whenever I want, but do be warned that the ending practically begs for a 2nd part. But even with the ending and the aforementioned minor issues, I definitely recommended this game."
286280,Steel Armor: Blaze of War,"  Intro      First and Foremost,   if you are looking for a fast paced 'shoot 'em up' style game, then this is   NOT   for you, this game is a simulator, not Call of Duty. If, however you are looking for a good armoured warfare simulator, Steel Armor Blaze of War is a sim you must have.     The Good    SABOW offers a large variety of gameplay, from intense close in battles in the bushes of Angola, to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan or long distance battles across the sprawling deserts of Iraq. There are two playable tanks in the game, the T-62 and the M60A1, both have fully 3D modeled interiors and most if not all systems in the tanks are operational.   There are three campaigns in the base game, each with two sub-campaigns for each faction as well as a fourth campaign avaliable as a DLC. The included factions that you can play as are Angola, Iran, Iraq and the USSR, I think you can also play as a Cuban tank crew. The large &amp; numerous maps are incredibly fun to play on, and they all offer a unique experience and require different tactics for the different types of terrain.  The phsyics of the game are also incredibly realistic, firing your gun over long distances will cause bullet drop which you need to account if you are to hit your desired target.   Some people have complained about the lack of tanks, while I would have liked to see some legends such as the T-72, T-55, Chieften etc. I beleive that the quality of the playable tanks in the game easily makes up for the quantity of them.    The Bad    While this game is incredibly fun and realistic, it does have some minor problems, but these are certainly not game breaking,  - Occasional but minor audio glitches  - Driver AI is sometimes quite frustrating (Probably just my poor commanding skills to be honest)  - Mission editor had a lot of potential, fully customisable scenarios would be great.    Summary    Steel Armor: Blaze of War is incredibly fun and realistic tank simulator with a good variety of maps and vehicles, all in all I would highly recommend this game."
286320,Oknytt,"The characters are all really fun -- even as archetypes/stock characters they don't feel overly cliche. The plot isn't anything remarkable, but it's an enjoyable romp through a marvelously stylized realization of Swedish folklore. Straightforward puzzles with an interesting elements mechanic and impressive visuals/music keep the momentum going throughout.   Some of the VA drags a little in spots, particularly in the final chapter, and not every puzzle is laid out in a satisfying way, but these are nitpicks in the grand scheme.  Runs about 5-8 hours, so good for an evening play with a friend or your kids. Pick it up full price if you're a fan of story-games. If it's on-sale at all, absolutely worth picking up for anyone."
286340,FarSky,"It's a pretty good game, it keeps you into it for a long time until you beat adventure. Adventure took me around 2 1/2 hours only because I was scared to go into the deep for a while and I never went night mining. After beating adventure mode you unlock survivor which is basically a harder version of adventure but still fun. While the game doesn't have the best of graphics, they are still pretty and if you just stand around and watch the wildlife swim around you (given that they are not predators trying to kill you) it is beautiful. It isn't that hard unless you decide to take on a whole group of sharks, and it can give you a solid 5-7 hours of fun. There is some aftergame stuff but not much. I would give it a solid 8/10 but only because they need to update it more, also something to make night pass faster plz, I hate staying in my base all night. Oh and there is a sandbox mode which basically allows you to do anything you want. Also quick note, the title screen is the only thing that counts for your play time for Farsky since the actual game is on Java, so I had to wait about 4 minutes to post this review."
286360,Shadows on the Vatican - Act I: Greed,"Good game, nice scenario.  Fells like you're in a movie. Most of these kinds of games has less visuals and lets you imagine the scene, but in this game they made the scenes 3D and more visual. If you like investigating, you can buy, it's worth what it costs.  In the other hand, it doesn't give you much opportunity to move arounds, most of the times you have to find what's the next step of the scenario and follow it. But since game has a nice scenario, that's okay."
286380,Strata,Puzzle game about colored stripes that must be removed in a certain order. Gets challenging as more are added. 
286460,Black Mirror II,"This is an instance where I would say that the sequel surpassed the original.   Pros:    Unlike the first Black Mirror, there were plot twists that caught me unexpected. In the first, I already knew exactly where the main plot was heading, and so the climactic reveal fell flat. While there were elements of the story that I felt were coming, there was still enough to surprise me that I got to enjoy experiencing the plot as I played.   The storyline ties into and expands on the first game, and doesn't create many inconsistencies with the first game, particularly    where it concerns Cathrin and the reveal that she is alive and at Black Mirror. Although, knowing this, in retrospect I found it odd that Victoria did ask Samuel to stay several times in the first game. However, given that in the first game, Samuel indicates that the entryway has been walled off, it prevents conflict with the sequel - whether intentionally done or no. (Honestly, I thought the walled in area would be come a plot point later in the first game.)     The puzzles range in level of difficulty. For a few, I admittedly had to succumb to the quick solve due to running out of patience. I liked that there were some that required more thinking, but that they weren't all 'beat-your-head-against-the-wall-in-frustration' levels of difficulty.   Being able to turn on indicators for interaction hotspots. While I didn't always use these, it was amazing to be able to do this when I had already been over an area several times and was stuck on what to do next. It often turned out that I had missed interacting with a single point of interaction just due to it blending in a little *too* well with the background.   The Double click to quick-interact. Especially when I'm tired of watching Darren just stroll across the room, casually looking at things.   Cons:   THAT FAUX BOSTON ACCENT, THOUGH. Hearing Darren and the girl in the shop (from New Jersey) talk was like listening to the worst regional accent parodies possible. The first time I spoke, I knew immediately that he was going to supposedly be from Boston, but oh man was that accent all sorts of awful to listen to. Also, I feel like there were some times in the story when they intentionally chose bad-movie-level-Boston-accent-accentuating words over others (particularly thinking of 'girders' here, for one).   As with the first, I did have some difficulty empathizing with Darren (our protagonist). As with Samuel in the first game, Darren often came off as being a somewhat crappy human being for little to no reason as a result of how some of the puzzles had to play out. This doesn't imact me in some games, like the Deponia series, because we are told up front there that the character is an all-out thoughless jerk and it's actually part of his personality. I think the reason that it bothers me with Black Mirror I and Black Mirror II has more to do with the fact that I felt as though through the gameplay, I was meant to empathize with these characters. In BMII, I did finally start to somewhat empathize with him as the story progressed.   Overall I recommend this game, even over the first. Playing Black Mirror I gives you some insight to the events that happened 12 years prior to this game taking place, but you could definitely play Black Mirror 2 as a standalone and get what you need from the first games' plot during interactions within this game."

286500,"House of 1,000 Doors - Family Secrets","House of 1,000 Doors is really a good example of hidden object game, it's not too difficult or too easy. The story is well written and you will discover the reason behind the house one piece after the other. If you like this kind of game, you should defenitely buy it. "
286520,Viking Brothers,I realy enjoy playing this game. :D
286540,Nearwood - Collector's Edition,"I didn't enjoy this. The story is nonsensical even by HOG standards, but you keep getting interrupted by your gnome companion to give lengthy speeches about it. There aren't any regulat HOG scenese, just a small number of limited ones where you have to find list of mostly identical items to complete a piece of machinery. Most of the game involves picking up junk and wandering around trying to find something to use it on, but navigation from room to room is annoyingly sluggish, and they put use of the map for travel on a limited timer like it's a hint, which makes no sense. Puzzles were mixed, some good some bad, I ended up skipping a number of them, which I usually don't do."

Linux Port:  Well this game was ported to Linux by feral, so no surprises here that this port is stunningly excellent. the game performs well, everything works as it should, including the extras mentioned above. the savegames can clud sync cross platform and even the voice recognition commands work, holy ♥♥♥♥  Feral isn't a publisher, they are practicing witchcraft"
286660,Avoid Sensory Overload,"Not really much to this game,You move a 'ship' back and forth on a grid to avoid blocks and holes in the grid.  seems incomplete.Not sure who the demographic for this type of game is. If I had played this first, I wouldn't have bought it even on sale.  I might not have even played enough to write a review, but it only takes a few minutes of playtime to know if I like a game or not, and this game is a definate dislike."
286690,Metro 2033 Redux,"A truly atmospheric experience. Metro does a superb job of immersing you into a post-appocalyptic setting. If you liked 'Fallout' - you will like this even more, and if you like 'Stalker' - you will just fall in love with the grim and gritty tunnels of Metro."

286880,Disney Planes," Ace Combat: Disney Cartoon P*ssy Edition.  No thanks, don't care for CARS, don't care for PLANES. It feels like Super Man N64.  1/10"
286930,Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon,"I tried playing for a bit, I really thought it would be great but the lack of strafing mixed with the environments being confusing as to where to go it just wans't enjoyable.  I also feel like the color system was just bland, I don't get why it's even there. You shoot red doods with red stars, and blue doods with blue. Great, what does that do for me? It doesn't add much if any skill to the game, it just makes shooting annoying and breaks the flow so much.  For a top down shooter this game is extremely slow paced with systems thrown in that do not makes sense for the type of game that it is and do nothing but slow it down even more than it already is. Without the extra unneeded systems thrown in this game's pace would just be bearable, but at current it is simply disgusting.  Would not recommend."
286940,S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2,Cool game for free to play game
2870,X Rebirth,It's what I've been looking for. After about 30 hrs I haven't had any real problems with the game. You should get it.
287020,Harvester,"One of the worst games I've played, lots of broken things, animations are bad.. and looks like a low budget film and messed up story telling, which or may not be your thing. Unless you like twisted mind screwing blood infestation, then this game isn't for you. I got this in a bundle, which is telling you the quality right there."
287070,Battle Academy,"Two things right off the bat. 1) The game is Awesome ! and 2) The tutorial is Absolutely Horrible.  Yes, no typos there, but lemme take a moment to elaborate. Let's get the tutorial out of the way.  Okay, so the tutorial's out of the way. No, I'm really not kiddin', there's almost zilch, zero nada in the tutorial, and it's set up in a very odd way, with lotsa buttons to attempt to click that do nothing and no helpful guide to any advanced strategies or tactics. I'm sure there are probably some very helpful guides out there for all those things, but they are definitely NOT in the tutorial.  At any rate, I found I could and did learn all I needed to know by going selecting the first campaign at the top and just plunging into the game headfirst. There was quite a bit of trial-and-error initially, and the game doesn't give you a lot of 'prestige-type-purchasing-power' like you may be used to in games like Panzer General or Panzer Corps. In fact, once you're in a battle, there's NO accrual of prestige or ability to purchase new units, etc. You only get options to do that at the start of the missions, but before you throw in the towel on that being a horrible idea, I'll explain.  You'll get a select # of units that are coming on each mission w/o fail and at no cost. You'll also have a limited amount of purchasing power to add key beneficial units as you see fit, and there are also limitations on just how many of each of those useful units are available as well. Part of the real challenge in this game is making sacrifices on what you'd RATHER have and what you can AFFORD to have ... these aren't always the same thing. Example: I'd RATHER have 2 25pdr arty units, and there are 2 available, but I need to have another Sherman Tank instead, or I need another engineering unit and a transport, etc. You'll quickly start to learn to 'make do' and discover just how much use you can milk out of units you might otherwise completely disregard.  It gets better. The first few missions are pretty easy-breezy. Then it starts to get tougher. Then it starts to get A LOT tougher ! At that point, you'll start to think 'there isn't any way I can complete this mission given what I have at my disposal !' And about the time you think that, reinforcements will start to show up ! I found the pacing of my need for more units vs the actual arrival of new units to be almost hand-to-glove in the first campaign.  There are a lot of things to learn, tactically, that will improve your odds of winning. You'll pick a lot of these up as you play. Or you can probably track down a guide to learn more about them. I'm probably running outta room on this review! Best of luck if you get the game, and Happy Hunting!"

287200,Wildlife Park 3,The graphics for wildlife park 2 are better. This game is a step backwards
287220,Autocraft, Early Access Review
287260,Toybox Turbos,"Same setup as a phone app that met micromachines back when you could get cd-roms in cereal. It is really bad. worth 1$ maybe but really really bad. Worst about it is that the camera doesn't follow you but what ever wierd system it wanna go on it's owned, which makes it so hard to turn or see what is up ahead that you are gonna hit, or just that you can't prober see if you are even touching the ground so you can turn. Just a NO, don't waste your time or money."
287290,Resident Evil Revelations 2,BUY IT. METAL RESIDENT EVIL GEAR.
287390,Metro: Last Light Redux,"Wow.. What a game.  What if Valve was an eastern european country, and they made their equivalent of Half-Life? What would you get?  You would get Metro: Last Light, that's what you would get.  For some reason I was expecting post-apocalyptic, open world do-a-bunch-of-missions-when-you-feel-like-it kinda game, but instead, I got a spookhouse, survivalish, story-driven thrill-ride on a very confined space. And that is a good thing!  The atmosphere, aesthetics and gameplay are all spot on. The game begins, you play through it, enjoy every minute of it and then it's done. It (for me at least) was free of bugs and played well on my ~7 year old PC. Only thing I needed to do was to install CursorLock to prevent the mouse cursor from wandering off to my second screen, other than that, nothing broke the immersion this game has.  I actually haven't really played the predecessor, and these games have been on my library for quite some time, with the label 'maybe some day'. But when that day came, there was no turning back, I just HAD to see it through. Very, very good gaming experience. Just get it and play it.  9/10"
287450,Rise of Nations: Extended Edition,"nice game, it be better if have high graphic... hope can play the sequal on steam (rise of legends)"
287580,Pandora: First Contact,The two issues I've had with the game are as followed. War is the only way to win. There are few actual factions so variety of matches are stunted some what. Otherwise it is a fun game that I have spent a lot of time playing.
287600,Sunset,It's an ironman mode only narrative rail shooter with inconsistent plot/characters. I have a lot of thoughts on it:         YouTube™ Video:  Let's 'Review' - Sunset&nbsp;
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Everybody in the reviews is hating on such an amazing game! Don't listen to them, gameplay is amazing, story is really dark for an MGS game, and there is really no need for a chapter 3, as there just so much ♥♥♥♥ing content already. Tho I would have liked more of this game tbh.  Potato/10  EDIT: Wrote that a while ago, forgot to update.  In retrospect, I can see why people hated this game. The introduction was amazing, out of this world! But the rest held it back.   Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is great, but it gets repetitive after 20 hours. I could not find myself finishing it because of how boring it got.   Story is non-existent, so that is bound to turn off some MGS vets.  Graphics are really good considering what is required to run it; the FOX Engine is a technical marvel.  Who am I kidding, if you wanted this, you would have bought it already. Value is 25$, considering how long this game will keep you busy."
287720,Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy,"This game is an atrocity, portraying every religious believer in it as a deeply evil mass murderer.  Oh look a bishop. Yup, trying to butcher hundreds. Oh, now a priest. Yup, same thing. Hey, there's a monk... Yup, you guessed it.  By purchasing this game you are funding the most vile bigotry that exists on steam.  I deeply regret playing this game."
287740,The Witch's Yarn,No. Don't waste your time or money.
287780,Derrick the Deathfin,Cutesy game. Ham handed. Demands a controller. Doesn't suppoirt keyboard very well. Game play has irritating constraints.
287840,TY the Tasmanian Tiger 4,"- Decent plaformer all things considered - Extremely disappointing under-use of Rangs - Cringeworthy 'cutscenes' and dialogue - Puzzle solving decently fun until you realize you need a specific Rang to find 90% of the goodies - Super duper short - Frustrating controls at times, which comes to point during the boss fight. Good lord, that boss fight... - Stupidly easy. Just run in a straight line and spam the Rang button - Feels kind of like a mobile title - Unbeatable pricetag during sale ($1.49) - Would buy again, simply due to the value, but would not recommend"
287860,8-Bit Commando,"I bought this because I wanted to play another Contra, and Konamy isn't exaclty interested in making another one. i didn't have any expectations, I just wanted a minimally solid run and gun platfomer to pass the time. So, how does this little game holds up? Well, pretty badly. This title has so many things going wrong it's hard to start. Well, let's go with the music. The music is done by some artist that may be famous, he may be good in his art and all, but the sound track doesn't mix well with the action. I makes the game boring. Remember Contra first stage, how warlike was that music? It was heart poundig, well done, made for an action game. It FELT good. In this game, the music makes you want to go to a moderate walk, instead of running, jumping and shotting aliens in the face. Then there are the levels. They are relatively long, with a lot of platforms, barrels, boxes and other stuff with no purpose whatsoever. Enemies are bland and not numerous. Some stages felt even a bit devoid of life (and action). Also, enemies have this tendency of shotting fast and outside the screen. It makes dodging bullets hard, but you don't die in the first shot here, you have a life bar (this game is not really hard compared to Contra either). Sometimes you only realise there is an enemy there after getting shot. To make things worse, your character is relativelly slow, not even close to the ninjas that were Bill and Lance. Yeah, in Metal Slug you control slow characters that can't even shoot in diagonals, but in that game enemies shoot (generally) slow and have predictable behaviour. You also die with a single shot too, differently from 8-Bit Commando. I also had some problems with a player 2 always spawning around and despawning in my playthrougs. Have no ideia if it is intended that way or not and I don't know how to fix it (and I don't care anymore). Then, there are the bosses. The ideas are not bad. Helicopters and other military stuff attack you with predictable patterns in straight forward routines. I liked them a bit. Sadly, they are not very engaging, but I think they are the best part of this game. Anyway, I didn't finish this and I never will... If you can get it for LESS than a Dollar (pra mim não vale mais que 1 real!) and you are REALLY craving for something that barely resembles Contra, that's ok. But keep in mind you may be still wasting you money even so..."
287900,Pro Pinball Ultra, Early Access Review
287920,Mortal Online,"(Edited) The game is fun and not for everyone. It's very hardcore. It's what you'd go to after you finish Skyrim, after you ran out of NPC's to kill (only everyone's doing it still). F2P isn't bad. No pay to win problems I can see. Imagine DayZ Elder Scrolls of Warcraft. That's this. Like damn, hardcore much? Only way to possibly get out of town is to join a guild. Friendly guilds weren't on the main continent when I played, so the forums are kinda mandatory if want to play... forces you to be social kinda. Unless you're really... good?"
287960,Yomi,"Do you want a game that feels like it was meant for an ipad?  Well then! Yomi is for you!  Gameplay wise, it's smooth just like the card game, the rules work nicely and make matches quick.  But it's a boring game visually, no flare or spectacle.  Play virutal chess and what you see is what you get, a clean game for the thinking man.  Play Yomi and what you get is pumping loud (Not very great sounding imo) music to boring static characters who rotate horizontally to indicate they're knocked over."
287980,Mini Metro,"Its a beautiful game, but very very shallow when it comes to actual game mechanics. Theres almost no challenge to the campaign mode because the requirements to 'beat' the level are very low and there is no further goals provided other than beating the level. Each level on the campaign also feels very samey- no new mechanics get introduced as the game progressed. Its an enjoyable little game, but it feels like its not worth the price I paid for the amount of interesting content in it."
288000,Oncoming Death Steam Edition, Early Access Review
288040,Actual Sunlight,Amazingly heart breaking and a profound experience.
288060,Whispering Willows,The story was simplistic an uniniteresting and the puzzles were little challenge.
288100,MechRunner, Early Access Review

288140,Perfect Golf,"Unoptimised , Buggy , Wonky physics and horrible UI design. Wanted to like it but simply couldnt and gave up on it. It could of been a great game but failed miserably."
288160,The Room,"There will be spoilers!!! The Room (note: not based on the films The Room or Room!) is a point and click puzzle game that will be familiar to anyone who has played a room escape video game or done a live action room escape. You are in the haunted attic of a mansion and you find an elaborate and ornate box. By flipping levers and dials, pressing buttons, putting keys in locks, and generally fiddling you slowly open more and more of the box and learn about the secret of the room. The plot is mostly flavour and mood rather than a concrete narrative. Puzzles are fun and generally fair. The game looks gorgeous. At 2-3 hours, I think the game is priced appropriately."
288220,Backstage Pass, Early Access Review
288260,Conflicks - Revolutionary Space Battles,This a good game try it!
288270,liteCam HD: Capture twitch.tv Live Stream,"First, i get MUCH better framerate and qualaty with FRAPS/ This gave me around 3fps. IT DOES NOT STREAM!!! Do not waste your money for this. yes it has more options then fraps, but the quality is so dang horrable. Use dvdvideosoft for HD video downloads with mp3 comversions. DVD videosoft is free and it works much better for Skype, youtube, and twitch videos."
288370,Strike Suit Zero: Director's Cut,"Strike Suit Zero: Directors Cut (SSZ:DC) is a game that I've quite enjoyed, with main campaign (13 Chapters) &amp; Heroes of the Fleet (6 Mission). The campaign story isn't isn't amazing, but it does it job of being a framework making the chapters all connect. It has wonderful graphics, backed by a great soundtrack, perfect for your battles with the Colonial Fleet. If you enjoy space battles: fighters, capital ships, explosions, this just might be worth a try."
288470,Fable Anniversary,"I loved the original Fable, the TLC version, and I was an active member of the modding community for the game.    I'm afraid to say that there's no modding here, and dodgy DLC which tries to plug the gap. But honestly, playing through the original game again with awesome graphics was all I ever wanted anyway."
288500,Black Rainbow,"Truly, the only person who can save the world is a random person assigned busy work of increassing absurdity that eventually leads to them having two random gems they rub together in a random room in some other dimension, which of course causes evil to finally be defeated.  Because chosen one."
288610,Kingdom Tales 2,"It's exactly like the first one, which I found nice. That's what I was hoping for. Simple resource management game with a light plot."
288650,HTR+ Slot Car Simulation,You'll kill a few hours with this game.  Just don't expect too much.
288670,Myths Of Orion,Good hidden-object game. A bit short.
288690,Sudokuball Detective,"finally we can play sudoku, but with the added difficulty of making it more annoying to enter your solution into the grid."
288710,Demolition Master 3D,Well this game is actually an enjoyable time waster. It is not anything like a high end aaa release. But it is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be .
288730,Redneck Racers,songs from the soundtrack include '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rocket' a song that talks about n*ggers and kising cousins.     i rate this confederate/dip  brb packin a lip full of dip yee yee
288750,Hotel Collectors Edition,"Well, it's a pretty easy game, very linear, but entertaining enough if you got it on sale for a few bucks (6,99 euro current normal price, is too much IMHO) (I got it in a bundle if I'm not mistaken). The biggest thing I missed was the speech, the intro and the final video do have spoken lines, but that's about it. The story is simple but likable, the puzzles are pretty easy, and no 'dead' ends..  This is a good adventure to play as your first (in this 2.5d adventure genre), took me about 3 hours (and thats including a break and leaving the game open). If you're a seasoned adventurer you might find it way WAY too easy..  So for me to make this game a little better, they should have done voice-acting throughout.. I'd rather have bad voice-acting than no voice-acting at all..  I didn't experience any technical difficulties, I played at 2560x1440 which will give you black borders at the side, but I didn't mind, ofcourse it would have been better if it was at least 16:9 instead of 4:3..  I don't know if they did another adventure after this, but I'll certainly would play it.."
288790,White Haven Mysteries,The graphics were pretty good in this game and the story line was ok. It felt a bit bland as it felt like I played it before - but never did. The puzzles were a bit easy for me but it did have the story line working for it. The end was a bit abrupt but understood. I would recommend this game for its overall content.
288830,Voodoo Whisperer Curse of a Legend,"First: ITS INCOMPLETE, and seems like we will never get another chapter to properly complete it.  However, I really enjoyed this game - the plot and atmosphere was intriguing and the hidden object scenes were well done. The art-style had a consistent expertise that is often missing from Hidden Object Games.   I do wish it had some fun achievements."
288840,Haunted Past: Realm of Ghosts,"I really enjoyed this game as it had some interesting ideas, was inventive and had an interesting story. The HO screens weren't repetetive and over all it was really well done."
288860,Realms of Arkania: Star Trail, Early Access Review
288880,Pineview Drive,"  This is unplayable due to the darkness of the game. While a horror game ought to be dark, it's important to SEE SOMETHING! 0,3 hours is nothing but keep in mind that 0,05 hours were spent seeing something and the rest being completely blinded. If I want to stare at a dark screen, I would turn my computer off."
288930,The Charnel House Trilogy,"I spent the last few hours wondering wether to give a positive or negative review and well, you can see by yourselves to what conclusion I came. I'm a little bummed by the fact that it's more an interractive story than a real game and it's very short (2 hours and you're done) but that story guys, THAT STORY: WOAH! I'm gonna be honest I thought it was inspired by a book and my first thought was 'Wait I gotta pause this and google who the author is then I'm gonna buy the novel. Period'. Props to the mind who gave birth to the story. I'm not gonna complain because the game hasn't been translated in my native language as someone did: there's everything you need to know about the game on its Steam page so you know what you're buying. You don't know english? Your fault, I don't see why the creators should suffer for your ignorance. You want it translated? Ask for it. Wait for it.  Nice music, really enjoyed the voiceover. The game is really easy, you can't go wrong. Only thing is: it's not worth the price. It's a great story but it's too short and leaves you questioning some stuff (that, as I read, should probably get cleared in the next longer game) so buy it when on sale because for the full price you could buy hours of good reading."
288970,Dark Lore Mysteries: The Hunt For Truth,"This game started out with real promise of a good HOG/Point &amp; Click game. But, it soon devolved into sloppy, too easy, and then a few wtf puzzle designs. The peg one is really bugged. No real storyline, either, and I soon just got bored with this game. I can't honestly recommend unless you have time to just kill and it's on a 90% off sale."
289050,Shannon Tweed's Attack Of The Groupies,"10/10, best use of a farm animal on Steam, 2016."
289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,workers suck and game crashes
289090,Ampu-Tea,"Nice game.... just kidding, Thanks indiegala for this ♥♥♥♥! (again) You cant even grab a tea bag because of the ♥♥♥♥ing hand, it gets broken as easily as the dev mother ♥♥♥, and its like impossible to grab ♥♥♥♥, no sticky hand. and it sucks, i mean, if you touch r, the thumb goes to the center, like, no realist ♥♥♥♥, dont spend your money here dude, im warning you, the only thing here is that you get ♥♥♥♥ for playing this and you can sell them.  -1/5 Would only play if i lost memory."
289130,ENDLESS™ Legend,"The game is uh... I have to check the oven. Be right back!  EDIT: LOL! 0 of 114 found this review helpful.   The game itself isn't that bad, just not my type of game. There is no unlimited turns..."
289180,A.I.M.2 Clan Wars,"Recommended to people who enjoy a little grinding every now and then. Because theres nothing better, than wasting all of your energy on a ship and then having to have almost no energy for repairs and thus being forced to return back a bit to grind some more crystals. As people say, it is buggy. Yes. But theres fixes to that in the guide section which works great. Owned the game on a CD from 1C but lost the CD and noticed it here, I dont regret buying it twice and unfortunately you can't buy the first one.   Positive:  A rather unique story line. A rather fragile (and hard to maintain) ecenomic system.  A game with more than one way to pass it. Suiting music to the setting of the game, making the general atmosphere is pretty amazing.  Customization of your glider lets you be just what you intend to be. The game can run on even the oldest of computers. (If you turn off steamoverlay to reduce the RAM usage)  Negatives It is ineeded bugged up, unfortunately the dev's didn't patch the game, but the are fixes to it.  A rather hard start, being a loner is not easy in a field of war.  Lack of explanation of the hotkeys, to know how to turn on some of the things you need to go to settings.  Too short of a tutorial, it only covers up the basics of movement and control, but not of economy.  Lack of tips. No open end. Unfortunately, once you finish the mainquest, the game ends and puts you in the main menu.  Overal: To people who never played this series, recommended for a new experience. It will be a pretty unique game for them IF they're willing to fix some bugs by patching their game. If you dont want to bother fixing it, you'll miss out on a great game. I personally recomend this game and one of those who are still hoping about the third part. Try it if youre willing to deal with it, itll be a new experience."
289200,Ascension to the Throne,Addicted? yes Want help? No Need help? Maybe Love this game and would of gladly paid more for it. Dont let first glance at graphics fool you
289240,Perimeter: Emperor's Testament,"the gameplay doesn't seem terrible, but there's absolutely no tutorial, and the UI is very difficult to understand"
289260,Dreamscapes: The Sandman - Premium Edition,"This game seems like it would be fun if it didn't crash almost constantly. In my half hour of playing it crashed over a dozen times. At the main menu, in scenes, in cut scenes. It doesn't seem to matter what's happening in the game, it just crashes over and over. I'm going to be getting a refund as it's completely unplayable."
289280,El Matador,"Controls just fine. The background music gets old pretty fast. I like that the weapons are all different and have a different feel and spread to it, however I just didn't really have fun playing the game so I can't really recommend this game.          YouTube™ Video:  El Matador | Steam Backlog Episode 20&nbsp;"
289300,Faces of War,"Where are the black people? The yellow people? The Mexicans? Where are the women? Where are the turban people? Where are the Jews? Why are there no Jews in this game? Faces of War is the most backwards game I’ve ever played! All the characters are WHITE MEN! What year was this? 2006!????? Where are the gnomes and the wheel chair people? They can drive tanks, too, you know! SO MUCH FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY!  And where are the gays? I see no gay representation in this game. I look at the soldiers and I’m given no way to see if they’re gay and stuff. That’s SO ♥♥♥♥ED UP!  In 1963 Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I have a dream” speech. This game came out in 2006. Faces of War is an insult to everything the Civil Rights protestors fought (and in many cases DIED) for! Faces of War is an insult to MLK Jr.’s dream! I bet the KKK helped design this game.  Oh, and that’s not all: guess where ALL of this game takes place? Europe! There’s more to the world than EUROPE you know? Earth also includes: Africa, Antarctica, China, and America you know? Jesus.  It’s not all bad, though. Just kidding. This game is evil. All it is is a celebration of white men. ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥."
289340,Freight Tycoon Inc.,"This game is terrible. I wouldn't recommend playing it or wasting your money on it. The game play is very boring, plot non existant, and if you're looking for a good Tycoon game; this isn't it. Stay away and don't waste your money."
289360,Konung 2,"I played Konung 2 for the first time roughly around 10 years ago (tragically lost the CD) and until the day I bought it again on steam I still think this game is a hidden gem that quite a lot of people missed out. Fast forward 40 hours+ in the game, this game shines even brighter as I managed to pick up details and hints I missed when I was a kid. High replay value IMO, because the game provides several character that you can choose as a main with each has their own story and background."
289380,Konung 3: Ties of the Dynasty,this game is impossible to play steam support is? well if i could contact them i would comment dont buy the game is my advice
289400,Parkan 2,"This game is not good. Nothing is implemented correctly(the AI is dumb, the FPS(on land) segments are pretty dull and boring with some pretty bad controls and every planet's a cookie cutter copy of the last one) the game is vast open and completely empty(the landscape of every planet literally has not a single living being on them), and worst of all, there are no humans. Not a single human being in the game as far as I have played it other than a few cutscenes. It's just.. boring. It's like a dollar-store Elite. The voice-acting isn't good either.   It's a good game if you want to simulate crippling loneliness, though. Me, however, I found it average and pretty much a huge waste of time. I kept it because I imagined I'd probably play it a few more times than just once, though."
289420,Planet Alcatraz,Needs work but it still has fun TB combat.
289440,Perimeter,"Painful game. The tutorial explained nothing having anything to do with the first game. Apparently, everything I had was under attack in the first game by invisible somethings with no explaination. I built a second energy station and it was attacked. The ground appeared to be splitting under the buildings which may have something to do with something but I couldn't tell. So I sat there awaiting something to happen which didn't until the power ran out and I failed the misson. At this point, the silver lining on this particular cloud is that I only paid $3.5 for it. Oh well, I will uninstall and try to forget we ever talked about this game. This had a 77 on metacritic which is baffeling."
289460,RC Cars,"hey, found a fix for the slow menu and gameplay just go into options then advanced video set max framerate to 70 optional turn on the triple buffer :))))))))))"
289480,The Tomorrow War,"I could obviously see the developers wanted too give a Wing Commander type of experience and failed. This game severely lacks competent voice actors, interesting characters and the dialogue is so bad. Every time I literally spent more time in the pre-mission BS and in a real time auto-pilot mode too and from a mission than actually in the combat mission. The sad part is that the actual combat is ok-ish, but not enough too warrant a full play through due too all the time wasting in a bad way in the non-combat sections. This was in the 1C space collection bundle so it was not a intended standalone purchase so I kind of got lumped with it."
289500,UFO: Aftershock,The game itself is great. I played it back in the day. Unfortunately it doesn't support widescreen display and i have not been able to find a way around this. No variation of patching or mods has allowed me to actually play the game. I just get a crash message on startup. It was only 99p but i'm disappointed because it is a fun game i wanted to play again.
289520,King's Bounty: Dark Side,"I found this buggy and disappointing. The game feels empty and underdeveloped. Not much really to say about it - not nearly as interesting as any of the other games. A fair few graphical gliches, and, while playable, it wasn't very fun."
289580,Aggression: Europe Under Fire,I love to play this i recommend this game to true RTS or civllization

289620,Collapse,"This game was very pleasant surprise. Good action, great leveldesign, nice story. Fresh wind from East, even though it's already nine years old thing. Only to see Kijev destroyed leaves bitter aftertaste, considering IRL events. And when you reach main city square in game, that feeling only strenghtens. But thats it, game creators are not responsible for politics.  Game itself is hard, brutal, but fun. Meele combat looks great, seems like motion capture team worked with skilled swordsman. Shooting is middle level, could be better, if you can use cover as your enemies. Weapons looks good and do their job, you'll often find yourself running back half map for shotgun or rocket launcher, which you dropped and bam! Few minutes later it would be lifesaver.  Leveldesign is really great. Destroyed city reminds me of Stalker and Half-Life 2, laboratory is mix between Deadspace and Alien movie. Bossfights have two levels - hard and easy. First and last boss are hell, because you need timing, skill and little bit of luck. The rest of them are only time consuming obstacles. And some of the bosses become common enemies - for example worm...  Cons? Yep, game have few - saving system, which should work better if was normal saving allowed. Than the cover using by enemies. OK, no problem, they don't want to be easy targets, but why can't main character do the same? And that's all folks ~_^  I recommend this game, if you want to experience 3rd person action with another look and interesting story. I found myself wondering, how the game would be succesful, if main character had japaneese name and the story would take place in Tokyo..."
289650,Assassin's Creed Unity,it wast let me move it's slow and i get stuck and it crashes every 1-5 minutes 
289690,Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris,"It's like someone who had never played a game before saw 5 minutes of gameplay from Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light and then designed this monstrosity with no comprehension whatsoever of what made the first one work. A dumptruck of useless gimmicks have been added, the controls have been changed in a way that makes them incredibly awkward, it's horribly buggy, and it's just not fun. Just get Guardian of Light and play it twice."
289760,ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS,"Played it for 10 minutes solo, asked for a refund. A friend came, we played together, I cancelled the refund :-P  So, recommended only if you intend to play with friends."
289780,Requiem,"Ok.. I am now going to have to bring this up.. and I was around when it was called Requiem: Memento Mori. so I'm not just some no name user. Note I also am on a not very good system.. and I have to say that I actually do recomend this game compared to others of its style (other MMORPGs basically) as it is actually one the very few I seen with a very gothic and dark feel with a horror sub theme (which there are more which has the horror subtheme but not both) And while yes.. the graphics ARE a bit dated... it means people with lower end computers like say.. MINE can actually run it. and to see a game that was this old still even up and running when others I used to play went away to make some newer 'Untainted' versions of it using even more fancy graphics I'd say kudos to this to even staying around even if the game is very much dated. Gravity has been known to make some rather good all be it not so hot looking MMORPG games (Ragnarok Online comes to mind here) this isn't much different in that line and was the first of thier games I played which used 3d rendering to its full extent (RO was 2d sprites on a 3D map) so all who I see giving it issues for being things I hate to say I have to shoot down. 1) The graphics are old   yea, and so is the game. to have it run for so many others theres some things that have to be cut. and the graphics being 'Dark' is INTENTIONAL as its ment to be a HORROR themed mmo. 2) It's to grind heavy. Try to name ANY real mmorpg without ANY grind in it.. I can flat out say theres atleast only like 2 or 3 TOPS. and those are only that way because of the fact that it isn't truely an MMORPG but more of a say ... fps or the like (Warframe comes to mind as the grind don't feel it as its more or less a squad based FPS mmorpg) 3) it's p2w.  umm uh not as much as you might think. they do allow us to gift the items so its not allways a fact of 'you need to pay X currency' more the thing of 'how do I get this for ingame cash even if its an insane number' 4) Open PvP Only server... ME NO LIKE!! ummm hey reject you want to look at nearly every other high earning mmorpg ever made and one the major features they HAVE. oh whats that.. Open World PVP.. Yep... and to save the costs (and thier user base) they had to only use pvp for thier server (they used to have a purely PvE server). I am a PvE only player but being I used to play World of Warcraft and the like.. pvp I am used to and when people ARNT that high on thier own selves to realize that pvp is a hinderance to them (being able to be openly killed in town by others isn't fun specially when your name is red) I've learned not to really let this bother me.. so why does some others complain of that..when pvp is actually a COMMON thing in mmorpgs"
289800,Dracula: The Resurrection,its ok a little tricky at some stages but the game is a little over price the graffit so so the story ok but stall not too bad of a game
289820,Dracula 2: The Last Sanctuary,Played after Resurrection which was the only one in the series I had played as a kid. Worth a play if you've played Resurrection but not otherwise.  Dem graphics though... seriously. Running on minimum 'cause PC can't handle it.
289840,Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon,"The game is beautiful despite an old gameplay that can result a little difficult at the beginning. Fantastic to play with the help of a Steam Controller, definitely easier than with mouse and keyboard.  However a very negative point: a lot of clues and riddles present in the original game have been removed or are automatocally solved in this version! It's such a pity!"
289890,"7,62 High Calibre","One of the buggiest, most unoptomized games I have ever played. If you can manage to play this, or the 'Hard Life' without constant bugs, crashing, freezing, etc. then yes, it can indeed be fun. Its a fun game, but due to the constant crashing, I have to give it a thumbs down. Save your game every 30 seconds becase it WILL crash very frequently"
289930,TransOcean: The Shipping Company,if you miss old dos game Ports of Call. This is the game you are looking for.
289950,Construction-Simulator 2015,"Pretty fun.  Certain parts can be a bit tedious, notably driving materials and getting equipment to job sites. Digging missions are great fun, you really get the feel for real the controls of a real machine. My 3y/o LOVES this game. (Although he REALLY sucks at it. Like, REALLY.)  It doesn't have the best graphics, and the physics engine can be a joke at times, (A small sedan will stop a fully-loaded cement truck going 60mph) but I still enjoy it."
2900,688(I) Hunter/Killer,game keeps crashing
290000,DubWars,"  Got this for free from Loot Crate and I love it. I was confused as to why my ship didn't fire when I clicked and was laughing when I found out the music is my weapon. I'm having way too much fun with this, really listening to the songs also to remember them in future plays so I know when there's a lot of pew and when there's less of it. Replayability is huge with tons of upgrades specific to each level, and I mean, you can honestly replay a level til you're sick of the song.  Can definitely recommend if you're a dubstep fan, you get to know a lot of new music and artists, and definitely also recommended if you enjoy the space ship pew pew games.  Only downside from me is that the backgrounds sometimes move and looks like enemies/missiles, can make it disorienting but not too bad."
290020,LogicBots, Early Access Review
290040,Retro Game Crunch,"A stunning collection of bite-sized, finely-honed, gaming goodness. Each with a different feel and a delightfully innovative twitst on classic themes, this little group of games is just too good to pass up. This collection proves that there are still tons of ideas to explore in the space of smaller, focused games that harken to the days of yore."
290060,Glitchspace,"I've seen a fair share of games give said player the ability to 'code' certain block or areas to let you progress further in the game, but I've never seen a game such as Glitchspace do it so well.  The game in itself has a sort of atmosphere to it, and delievers more than just a simple 'This goes there and this goes here', and it will let you get lost in it's atmosphere if you let it. The atmosphere kind of feels like those side levels in Assassin's Creed 2(I think), where you collect a certain amount of fragments, you go back to the isalnd, and you enter these portals that take you in a clean, crisp, and Sci-fy type of feel. Anyways, away from the atmosphere, the game is a first person puzzle game, and if you don't know how to code so well, then you may be stuck on some puzzles for awhile. The game gives you certain abilities for your, what the game calls a 'toolbox', that you are going to unlock and use later down the line, ranging from timers to impact force. I'm not a paragraph man, I'm a bullet man, so let's get into listing some Pros and Cons, shall we?  Pros: + Has a very atmopsheric feel to it. + If you don't know how to code, you can get a feel for it here, and if you do know how to code, this can help you, I guess. + A very easy game to pick up and put down, there is no rush. + Has some amazing music tracks and sound effects. + Leaves you with a sense of mystery of what goal your working toward and why your doing it, which is the kind of stuff I like. + Has very low graphic demands but still delivers what it needs to. + Has a compass which tells you which direction your facing, which comes into play way more than I'd like to give it credit for figuring out which way I'm facing and how to code said block. + Has a simple GUI for coding said blocks.  Cons: - The atmosphere can easily be broken because some puzzle leave you with little to no information on what to do. - Later in the game, you get the ability to place down your own platforms, which means if you get stuck on a puzzle, you can place a platform down and cheap your way through some puzzles in the game, which I have had to do atleast 3 or 4 times out of the 40ish puzzles I've completed. This once again leaves you with a feeling of unfulfillment and/or an unfinished game, which disconnects you from the atmosphere. - The coding GUI has an annoying expansion system, you click on a box, a sub-unit of boxes expands around where you clicked said box, making it a bit annoying if your trying to speed through a puzzle. - For being on sale for $7 bucks when I got this, I'd honestly say that the game isn't worth the $13 or so bucks that it ask for normally. The game idea just isn't fleshed out enough or the game just doesn't expand on it's core features enough to be worth it.   Overall, I'd personally say that the game is worth getting, but if your a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me, wait for it to be on sale."
290080,Life is Feudal: Your Own, Early Access Review
290140,Echo of Soul,"I would totally recommend this game, but steam and the game are having problems right now and it won't connect my steam account to EOS anymore :| I don't want to restart since I have rare items that I don't want to lose :( anyone have any tips to fixing this?"
290260,Sokobond,"Overall: Good Difficulty: Very high  Likes: - Gradually introduces a variety of game mechanics (breaking bonds, compound bonds, rotation, inert atoms, and combinations of these) which keep things interesting and increases difficulty - Later puzzles are very challenging - Great sound effects  Dislikes: - The more complicated puzzles feel less tightly designed because there are so many possible moves that look like they might lead to the solution. This is especially true since you are not given what the goal molecule should look like, so often you can't even tell if you are headed in the right direction. - I personally prefer logic puzzles, and these Sokoban-style puzzles rely more on spatial reasoning"
290280,Volt,Pros:   - looks cool  - mechanics of it  - good price point  - music was enjoyable  Cons:  - brain power required  - some bugs inside game  In conclusion if you want a cheap puzzle game this may be the game for you. Buy it when its on sale.  #TrashORTreasure 
290300,Rebel Galaxy,"Rebel Galaxy is a space game less like Freespace and Elite Dangerous but more like Freelancer. It is by no means a complicated game, but it is a lot of fun. Controls are pretty straightforward and easy, there's really not much getting in your way before you're crushing space pirates or hunting traders.  "
290320,Project Temporality,"Cool game, just wish I could zoom out a little bit more, though the concept is great and if it is on sale would recomend buying, lots of fun."
290340,Armello,well done game! this and atlas reactor is all you need for table top type games
290380,Micron,Want a game with good music? Don't look here. The music is actually pretty bad and gets annoying fast. Want a game with a fair difficulty curve? Don't look here. Levels 1-4 are easy and level 5 is really hard. Want a game with good controller support? DON'T GET THIS GAME! The joysticks when used with an XBox controller are just the mouse.
290440,QUALIA 3: Multi Agent,"Can't say I really enjoyed this game. It's a fun concept game but feels like a student project. The upgrades aren't very exciting and seem only based on the push/pull aspect of combat. Speaking of combat, it's fine, place bomb and hope it floats to your target. The bosses (that I fought) can only be hit in 1 spot and nothing on them is breakable so it's just frustrating having to grind the same slow levels you can beat and hope you can unlock something that might help. The music is fun at first but does get repetative.  Fifty cents for this game, fine. Investing more time into it, nope."
290460,Legionwood 2: Rise of the Eternal's Realm,I am a little dissapointed about this game.  Its nothing like an epic quest. In fact its a very short game (under 10 hours for the first gameplay) and don't even start with the ending(s). The idea of mixed skilled classes is useless because the possible skills are mostly useless. This is the first RPG I played without a mage and cleric. Fights...yes there are many random ones but you can skip them with running or equip a trinklet that stops them completely. You don't need the exp. or money because in fights just use one of the drop agility skills in combination with poison and even the endboss never gets to hit you.
290490,The Flock,"This game had an interesting concept, but it is now unplayable due to the 'population' set up on it. The game is useless now that it is over due to a 0 population, so I wouldnt buy it unless the devs add a way to make the game playable more.   This game basically took the same fate as Dead Island: Epidemic"
290530,Clandestine,"The co-op is a bit iffy but with friends, or alone this game is genuinley very fun. Yeaaah, theres a lot of broken things but all I care is I had fun. Nice game to mess around with."
290650,Time Ramesside (A New Reckoning),"EDITED: 9-4-2015 First i didn't recommend this game, but I forgot that it was early acces. The game may be glitchy and laggy when you buy a early acces game you buy acces to the alpha and the alpha is called alpha because the game isn't finished. Since the devs keep fixing the bugs and they keep updating it might become worth any money somedyay. EDITED: 2-6-2015 They released the game and it still sucks."
290730,My Lands,"This game has a simply stunning villain. Once you begin playing, you see that there are people who clearly did not put too much thought into the creation of their game, but then you marvel at how realistic their ideals and goals are. They play the role as a manipulative development team just to feed their couples. Nominated for 'Villain in need of a Hug' Award."
290770,The Fall,"Nothing really happens in the game. You solve couple of puzzles and kill some bots/slugs for few hours. Whole content is very sparse, the ending abrupt and only brings new questions without answering any. Story does not develop at all... just... No. However, I must mention that those puzzles themselves are really good and the way you have to solve them is very creative. Plus the occasional satirical humour is amazing and perfectly delivered, but still it wasn't enough, the lack of other things was too high."
290790,Grey Goo,"It's just so bland.  Petroglyph. You can do better. There's very little unit variety, very little meaningful choice, and the only real unique piece (goo) is half-♥♥♥♥♥. The presentation isn't even up to standards and they wanted to go for that hammy sci-fi Avatar story line, and didn't even succeed there."
290810,Colossal Kaiju Combat™: Kaijuland Battles, Early Access Review
290870,Steam Squad,"Was really hoping this was going to be a gem, but it seems to have totally missed the mark for me. Ultimately, this is an extremely shallow game, granted I only made it to the third mission before having to quit forever, so maybe there's more content I haven't seen... but doubtful.  For starters, the first thing I noticed about this was the extremely amateur production. And that's not in like a indy-dev boot-straps and moxy kind of way, it's a very unpolished game that shows very little thought was put into many of the design choices, even things that have been standard for years. Interface is pretty lacking, common QoL shortcuts are none-existant, prepare for lots of needless clicks. Mission briefs are full of useless nonsense and lacking in actual content, you'll read a few .jpg's sliding on the screen and wait for the animation of pages shuffling to see each useless one. Random transitions during the intro cinematic were absolutely jarring really the first big red flag I noticed. They quickly, often, and randomly changed from cartoony animated 3D, to 2D, to actual live footage, to still shots, and then back again. Pick a style! It's like all the content was salvaged from the free demo bin Baby's First Game Dev book. It honestly feels like a lot of things in here were added to increase the game's run time and pad the clock. Either to create and illusion of lots of content, or to get people past the Steam refund wall.  But, that's all kind of nit-picky stuff I realize most won't care about. So actual gameplay. It's shallow, real shallow. In the first three missions I played through I was presented with the same 3 unit types. Their differences end up being trivial ultimately to the mission at hand. There is an inventory but it is clunky and I regret even noticing it because it was irrelevant to the game and just forced me to navigate more terrible menus. The actual missions are dull just wait for them to rush into our overwatch areas, forced cinematics that are hardly what I would call 'animated' that add nothing but time to the mission. At the end your well performing troops get experience and stats... but what that is good for I've yet to determine. 3 missions, you'd think you'd get a level up, or new gear, or new unit, or something. But no, there is absolutely nothing new to incentivize good performance or even loading the next map... so I didn't.  So at the end of that, I think this game is really close to being something great but seems to have been pretty mismanaged for a while and is way off target for what would be expected of a modern game. P2W mobile games have more content than this for before the paywall."
290890,You Must Build A Boat,"tough, but im going to have to say no to a recommendation.  - inconsistant difficulty, mainly due to random nature. - not all concepts translate well to non-touch screens. - music is too damn catchy! - have stopped having fun, but want to press forward just to finish it.  Lots of box types, vast majority are useless when facing an obstacle. So many boxes are broken and wasted in between obstacles.  Some sections took me 15mins to clear, others took me over 2 hours of gameplay because of the difficulty and slim chances of the planets aligning to make the objective possible to complete."
290970,1849,"This game looked a little like 'Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom', and it certainly feels that way too. But this game is so restrictive compared to Rotmk - so I would rather play that game (they have VERY similar game dynamis..)."
290990,Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook,I played this game very early on in my VN days and because of that I wasn't focusing on the right bits. I payed more attention to the 'game' bit and less to the story which I regretted at the end. I did enjoy replaying it though and thought it was a lovely escape.
2910,Fleet Command,Really fun pulling this game out of the archives. Still enjoy it.
291010,The Hat Man: Shadow Ward,Best game of all time !!!!
291030,Always Remember Me,"I won't lie, I cried. I couldn't take it mentally, to be forgotten for all my hard work I put into a relationship with this man. Just to have this B*tch come in and try to take him from me. In the end, I went down a path of my own of writing but then I became more depressed as the game tells me about how everyone else is super successful and happy and I'm an unsuccessful writer that still lives at home with my aunt. I had an emotional breakdown irl because I thought I was doing good and then my life flashed before my eyes, and I'm tearing up again. I can't take this game. BibleThump"
291050,Planet Stronghold,"Solid visual novel with a sci-fi storyline. I enjoyed the 'prequel' game (which actually came out first) a bit more, but this installment is quite enjoyable and worth a play-through if you like visual novel-style games with some turn-based combat elements."
291070,Slip,"Great platformer with a nice twist, great music. MUCH HARDER than your average game. I never got past Level 4."
291090,I Get This Call Every Day,I was once employed by a customer service company and telling the caller to F themselves has never been this satisfying.
291130,Akane the Kunoichi,"An interesting retro platformer adventure? I liked the leveldesign as it's quite beautiful and fits with the theme, feudal Japan. And that's about it.  The controls are wobbly at best, the walljumping is terrible and enemies can corner  you pretty quickly if you don't anticipate it. I feel like this was one of those games where they came up with the character first before writing the story. From my view the story is not all that well thought out and mind you, really cliché.  A warrior, or samurai is admired (and or loved) by a lot of girls, the protagonist being one of them. Some evil guy pops up and steals said samurai. Hmm.. where have I heard that plotline before? Oh right, in every Super Mario game ever. They only reversed the genders. I don't know what it is with that 'female protagonist' trend.. I like games with female protagonists in general, so I usually buy them and give them a shot. This time, however, I was disappointed. Also that's about all you get for a plot line. No additional thoughts, just genderswapped Mario.  I have not researched the game's creators, but I reckon this is some kind of university project by one or two people. It's not a bad start, but there's a lot waiting to be fixed, for example the controls and general responsiveness of the game.  All in all I'd say it's more or less well thought out, but kinda got cut short during production. There's definitely some potential there, however I don't see a reason to buy something that reminds me of Mario and Megaman, however is just inferior in quality. I'd have to say this game earns about a 6/10."
291170,Royal Defense,"It won't play on my Mac and it freezes on my PC. The level I played was great, but it only happened once and there was no response to my forum question asking for help."
291190,Heroes of Steel RPG,A terrible UI clearly unchanged from mobile origins (to pick a lock takes 4 clicks one of which is because it doesn't do anything the first time you click...) and endless tedious and clunky scripted sequences with cliched dialogue and big-titted rogues.  Not recommended.  edit: supposedly it's changed now but I haven't checked it back out yet.
29120,Yumsters! 2: Around the World!,"Yumsters 2: Around the World is a puzzle game using small 'worms' eating fruits of their color. They will move around the world to discover each place and to find new instruments to make new sounds because yumsters really love music.  It's pretty boring, there's no real challenge, the puzzles are pretty easy. Even after 5 hours of play. "

291270,Vitrum,+
291290,Motte Island,very simple game indeed but has a horror element on it.. yet its simple but it make you wanna to play it again and again. the game play was good and the story-telling was nice if you fancy of horror game kinda like; TRY THIS game
29130,Musaic Box,"Construct the music...Now while I had a major advantage of knowing most if not all the tunes, this was still a challage in some areas. If you like solveing puzzles then this may be for you. I found this very enjoyable up to the end."
291330,Final Slam 2,WTF IS THIS GAME!
291370,Undead Overlord, Early Access Review
291390,Three Dead Zed,"Nice, fun, worth giving a try"
291430,Lost Marbles,Well I rate this game:   9/10 It's okay
291450,Smugglers 5,fair price at 9.99. Better price at 2.50. Good game either way
291480,Warface,"This game is a solid 5/10. it gets a 5/10 due to the PVE portion and the Special Operations portion of this game. The grind is horrible. Earning 'Warface Dollars' is ♥♥♥♥, you earn like 60 bucks a game unless you buy vip..BUYING VIP.   The repair costs are extreme as ♥♥♥♥ so you have to either buy vip or run default gear and get shredded in PVP or just stay in the back and get carried in PVE. The game is basically P2W in PVP omg.   PVP is nothing more then Get the strongest armor, grab a shotgun and slide and one shot all day.   Every other class is ♥♥♥♥ing useless you camp spawn and even then there is no spawn rotection to stop spawn trappers. This feels like a half backed COD clone with nothing but cool skins and fancy reload animations.   The Special OP missions are nothing more then MW3's special op missions. the sad part is that the missions are just 'stay here and shoot these 100 guys who all either cyborg ZOMBIES, rocket launchers (AT LEAST 20 OF THEM SHOOTING YOU AT ONCE), or spec op soliders sniping you all the same time. Every mission. Nothing inovative or new brought to the F2P table.  After 200 hours i give it a thumbs down. I know they need microtransactions to keep the servers running, but with all the money they earned they can at least start thinking of new ideas other then just a new map but same playthrough with the same stragety. They recently add blitz and it seemed fun quicked turned into a similar gamemode(STORM)"
291550,Brawlhalla, Early Access Review
29160,Blueberry Garden,Work of art. That feeling in 10-minute game of realising you have to identify food source for Dali-esque wildebeest thingies so they can make path to giant apple. I got this when it came out and hope I'm still on high score table :p
291610,Growing Pains,"This game could be incredible if it was more fleshed out. The concept is lovely, and the character handles tightly, but having solid mechanics is not enough for me to recommend it.  I try to only purchase games with aesthetics that really appeal me, so I have no idea why I thought Growing Pains was a good idea (heck, even the font is corny). The rudimentary graphics made me wonder why this isn't just a broswer Flash game. The 'particles' from the lasers and glow sticks are really nice, which is quite incongruent with the lack of details everywhere else. I feel that the developers could make it work quite easily by adding touches here and there.  The game only contains nine levels, and that's so inadequate for a paid game! Though there are ten other user levels, the base game is simply not meaty enough.  Simply put: there are many more platformers that deserve one's attention."
291640,Mirror Mysteries 2: Forgotten Kingdoms,Game felt very short. The HO screens were more about random clicking than actually looking. Often after cut scenes it takes too long to regain control of the mouse. Quite disappointing.
291650,Pillars of Eternity,"Solid game. I began playing RPGs since the early Heroes of the Might and Magic days. I do look forward for some old-school-ish RPGs.  Things I liked: + Solid story line with vibrant background history of fan-sponsored NPCs. Really draws you in. Plenty of reading materials. + Solid battle mechanics. Logical and reaonable counters for each creature/weapon type.  + OK Map desgin, great aesthetics.  + Plenty of side quests and tasks.  Things I grew dislike the game as I progress through the main quest line. I spent over 50 hours and nearly finishing the main quest. - Attribute check during conversations. This limits the choices severely, especially during late-game. When your character cannot grow on their primary attributes, you will run in problems that your character cannot pass EVERY attribute check. Then what's the point of putting them there? Don't tell me I should have known this before I create my character. I started this fresh like a new book. Can this system be improved? Certainly, can the skills contribute to the growth of attributes? - Stat buff from artifacts/armors/jewels/etc... don't stack. Seriously? What is the rationale of this? And to add the confusion, some weapon buffs DO stack. Again Seriously? This is the first RPG I played have this kind of system, which really boggles my mind as why.  - The loading screens. I understand maybe it's the limitation of the engine. But for some smaller maps, like entering/exiting a house, can we not have a loading screen? It shows up too much till a point that you feel sick of it.   I enjoyed immensely in the beginning. But the game grew stale till the end and the fun gradually worn off due to the three minuses above. Do I recommend this game? Maybe. Since finishing the story is what it counts for RPGs, I have to lean slightly to a NO."
291710,The Lost Crown,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I even took into account that it is almost 10 years old . However it is SOOO SLOW...the story, the character's walking. While the storyline is intriguing I just wanted to pull my hair out the entire time. That being said I absolutely love the graphics....black and white with color accents, just beautiful. Love the Tarot cards. But overall I just couldn't get into it. Someone with more time on their hands (and a smaller Steam library) may like this game but I just can't invest the time on such a slow paced game."
291770,The Last Crown: Midnight Horror,"The Last Crown: Midnight Horror is not up to the quality of the previous games. Though I still like the characters, the mood, and the way the game is colored, it is much cruder in attitude; and though the overall story is OK, I found making progress through the story to be difficult. It was often the case that I had to do something I didn't expect in order to trigger the next thing to do. I ended up using a walkthrough to help me complete the game. If you don't play this one, you're not missing anything."
29180,Osmos,"The first levels are fun, but later on it just becomes tedious. Probably the worst thing is that some levels can take you hours to complete, and I mean without messing up. Counting deaths it took me a DAY to finally get lucky and beat one of the more difficult levels. Really frustrating. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but the most determined completionists. 4/10"
291910,Firefighters 2014,i cant finish downloading it because i m missing file 
291930,Industry Empire,"RATE 5/10 - Too Pricey, should be 10$, interface and windows is a bit clumsy and take up too much space, a general storage depot would be great so you don't have to micromanage every single chicken farm, grain farms etc. Road building works well but i often ends up having problems figuring out where im allowed to place roads and it snapd too quick to buildings, ending of the game is kind of odd, when you go into minus the game just ended without any warning...  generally Industry empire is nice enough game and the contract system is a great concept when the 'automation' works, which is sadly not that often, trade routes would be a great idea or at least the option to automatically sell to the nearest city, for this game to be great, in my opinion it need the transport schemes found in games like Railroad tycoon and TTD, you quickly find it impossible manage your buildings and progress at the same time, it just makes it unenjoyable to play.  at first i 'Thumbed up' the game, but since then no changes have been made by the developers despite alot of criticisme, lately i've experienced a lot of frame drops, we are talking 16 fps, even though im running a 980 ti, the game is absolutely unplayable.  i really hope the developers would fix these things and rethink the trading system, i mean just implement a RRT like system to towns and voila, it's sad because the game really is fun to play, is so enjoyable to find resources, build mines and steelmills etc. and see you little empire grow etc. etc.  but sadly in this state im not playing it again, but DAMN i want to...."
291960,Elminage Gothic,"The game is fantastic, made by experts of the genre and it is extremely fun and addicting. Yes, the consolized UI is bad, but the rest of the complaints you will see in the negative reviews here are nonsense. Map availability is not an issue. Inventory space is not an issue. Learning the mechanics is not hard and you can complete the game with any party. Yes, you will get killed, petrified, beheaded, turned to ashes, level drained and entombed in rock. These are fun mechanics, people. If you can't handle it, you might have low T. It's insanity this game has a Mixed rating on steam. This is a must buy game if you like dungeon crawlers."
2920,Sub Command,"Not so much a game as a second job: you can let the auto-crew do much for you but let's face facts: the appeal of this game is how much it demands from you. Want to work out the firing solution for the 89cm ADCAP torpedo manually? Of course you do, this game was written for you.  The plotline (nasty Russians go to war with the USA for some reason) is not really developed - I'm halfway through the US campaign - BUT the opportunity to play the campaign from the Russians' perspective is a very welcome, plus you have to re-learn the entire control system, this time using the metric system.  Not entirely sure why there are two US boats unless driving a clapped-out piece of junk like the 688i appeals to your inner masochist, but there is much much content for the player who's prepared to do some homework. Bonus: you can start the war early by murdering Russian/US ships and the game just lets you go ahead and do it.  7.5/10, would surface through polar ice again"
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I think it's just so so when I'm playing, but I'm moved when I look back into it."
292060,Final Hours of Titanfall,This ♥♥♥♥ is not a game... cheated my money
292090,Rube Works,"Didn't like it, controls are a bit finicky."
292120,FINAL FANTASY XIII,everything is excellent but the only one bad thing is Frame rate
292140,FINAL FANTASY XIII-2,"I really liked this game on PS3, but will not run on windows 10."
292160,UFO: Aftermath,"Though the graphics are older, this game is one of my top favorite classic games. I saw this on steam and had to buy it."
292180,X-Plane 10 Global - 64 Bit,"Poor design, poor interface. Difficult to configure. Autopilot does not function properly, user interface difficult to use while flying and controlling the aircraft.  Realistic, yes. But to the detrament of the enjoyment of the user."
292200,Crazy Plant Shop,Charming puzzle game about running a plant shop.
292230,Game Character Hub,Included art assets are only useful for RPG maker (license wise). If you want to use it for anything else (e.g. Unity) you need to secure your own assets that are not RPG maker based which I've yet to find anything. You can try searching the steam workshop for art but there isn't anything there to really specify if it's OK to use outside of RPG maker.
292240,SPY Fox 2: Some Assembly Required,"There's nothing I can really say about this great game that hasn't already been said here. It's a classic from my childhood, I bought it to fuel my nostalgia, and it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing."
292260,SPY Fox 3: Operation Ozone,A bit less pretty than the previous ones. But the puns are great!
292280,SPY Fox in: Cheese Chase,When the levels got higher it was soooo hard!!11 This game give me the creeps but in a ood way lol
292300,SPY Fox in: Hold the Mustard,"Hold the Mustard was the last spin-off game to the Spy Fox series and the only one that features a villian who doesn't appear in the main series trilogy. The plot is about a mustard company CEO named King Konglomo(yes he is a parody to King Kong) who is fed up that cosumers are preferring ketchup over mustard. So he crafts a crazy plan to rid of the world's supply of tomatoes so that way consumers will have no choice but to choose mustard for their burgers, hot dogs, pretzels, etc. Word of the scheme is notified to Spy Fox who is aided by Quack &amp; Monkeypenny to stop King Konglomo's insane plan. By piloting a hoverpod called the M.E.S.S., Spy Fox must go on a global quest to destroy all of King Konglomo's robot probes that are stealing all of the tomatoes. Like the Cheese Chase game, it's an arcade style game except instead of it being a rail shooter it's a free roaming style game. In each level you control the M.E.S.S. and must destroy as many robot probes as possible in order to proceed to the next level. Most levels are challenging when the number of robot probes becomes overwhelming. While certain levels are easy when the objective is not to destroy the robots but instead destroy a control center that is controlling them. There are various power up items that can help you out for a limited time. If you played the Cheese Chase game, then you'll know what to expect with this game. The game play is very fun, and highly recommended for anyone who likes Spy fox or the Humongous games in general."
292330,Starship Corporation, Early Access Review
292370,DarkEnd,Absoulute Garbage. Worse than big rigs...
292380,Racer 8,"  so everyone is agreeing to the fact that this game is actually very stupid, yet everyone still has it in thier account, this game desirves a medal of some sort"
292390,Realms of the Haunting,For years I wondered what this game was called. Now I know.
292400,Unrest,A story rich indie game where you get to play from the point of view of several characters. Great music and character development.
292410,Street Racing Syndicate,An old classic. I have played this game as young sausage. Now after all this time I am glad that I can play it again. + Tuning + Car damage model + Steam cards + Lot of Tournaments - don't have.
292420,Panzer Elite Action Fields of Glory,not much to say about it....  just a generic tank game nothing special really in it  i mean it has a few bugs which can be funny but thats about it  6/10 i mean theres nothing that bad about it but theres nothing that good about it either
292480,Magical Battle Festa,How did this even get in my library?
292500,Kero Blaster,"Awesome game. It's like a light version of Cave Story. You still can upgrade your weapons and health, but levels are linear and there are just 7 of them. But after completing the game you unlock 'Zangyou' mode, which is not only harder, but also kinda continues the main story. - Gameplay is great; - Sound is great; - Pixel art is great. If you like Cave Story then you probably would like Kero Blaster as well."
292570,Chompy Chomp Chomp,  This game is basically another pacman clone with a try hard modern look. The game lacks graphical settings and control settings. The current controls are terrible and the gamepad doesn't work on this game. Multiplayer is only locally which is by already mentioned problems unplayable. Not worth the current 7 euros instead this should be free with option of donation.
292600,Duet,"A nice game with some unexpected story to tell and wisdom to spread.  The great soundtrack is contributing to the very relaxed atmosphere and the game itself is easy to get into but will get pretty challenging over time.   For those of you who enjoy these kind of skill-dependent games, look no further."
292620,Pressured,  #LittleLycanOnSteam
292630,Uriel's Chasm,The amount of diseases I have got from this game is to much to list. Worst of it though is the leprosy I received with the flashing text and my face deteriorating from it. I physically died from the leprosy and I was brought back to life to return to play this turd. Reason for this you may ask? Because this game won't let me die. I have been binded to this game by a prophecy and I'm damned for eternity
292660,Princess Isabella,This is a very pretty game and smooth to play. It's a little 'hand-holdy' in the beginning but lets you free roam a little bit more as it gets through it. First one that I didn't need to look up at walk-through to because of confusing directions or puzzles. Good to go!
292670,Princess Isabella - Return of the Curse,"I think there was a bug - at the end of the game I selected to go into the HAND, however this stopped the game for me. I checked on the internet and there were more pages to play. a bit disappointing, however, i'll look forward to the next installment."
292730,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,  I got VAC and game banned for this game on 3rd January 2017 just after i upgraded my pc with new GTX1070 GPU and also ASUS 144Hz monitor the monitor came with a program call display widget thats a hack to these people..So becareful the game is ♥♥♥♥ anyways i got it off some free steam cards but just sending a warning...$129 down the drain its all good.  Happy Gaming all.
292760,Rise of Prussia Gold,I honestly dont know what was going on in this game... something political
292780,Pajama Sam 2: Thunder And Lightning Aren't So Frightening,"It is true, Thunder and Lightning aren't really that frightning  10/10"
292820,Pajama Sam 4: Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff!,"If you have any of the recent Windows software, this game will not work for you. I have Windows 8.1 and know people with Windows 10. Windows 7 doesn't appear to work either.  All in all, unless you have a dinosaur of a laptop I don't reccomend this. I'd get the game working for a second and it would crash. Looked on the forums too and other people seem to have the same issue yet it hasn't been resolved.  Don't buy this game. A literal waste of money because you can't even play it.  UPDATE:  WOW. Steam won't even let me post this review because I need AT LEAST five minutes of gameplay on it. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Don't buy this game. Please, please don't. I've been putting this game off and on just to get it up to five minutes so I can warn all of you.  DON'T BUY IT!!!"
292840,Pajama Sam's Sock Works,This game is LIT AF PJ Sam is so dope and learning how to put away socks really helped me in the real world  If you don't have this game yet pick it up
292860,Pajama Sam's Lost & Found,"Not like the other Pajama Sams. Basically, the endless runner before endless runners were popular. 1/5 voice too annoying."
292880,Robin's Quest,"Short game, but fun to pass the time with if you don't have much else to do."
292910,Deponia: The Complete Journey,"The first part is really good, the second one even better and the third starts off quite promising - but trust me when I say that the ending is just about the worst one I know. Yes, I played Mass Effect 3. This one is far worse. I also don't think that the 'June Puzzle' was a good idea, but well, that's just me."
292930,Black Mirror I,Very slow game.
292990,Nobunaga's Ambition: Souzou,Highly Enjoyable for the person who is interested in history of Japan.
293160,AntharioN,"The graphics are good classic rpg style and the dungeon crawling is satisfying. However, as an experienced dungeon crawler/rpg player, I will list some stuff here that kills the game for me:  1. monsters never respawn, ever. 2. Skills are very limited, which along with #1 makes the game suck such as if you don't immediately raise foraging skill, you will be getting CRAP loot on monsters that never respawn. Feels like ruining the game. 3. Same thing with barter skill - limited gold. Better raise it quick if you want to buy items or train other skills. 4. Low level cap of 24. They may have fixed it with nerfed leveling after level 24. Not really sure. Either way it seems like it would still suck, and I couldn't easily figure it out from the discussion forum or any word from the devs.  5. Can't rotate camera or move the view. Seems like there will never be a chest or container against the wall on the bottom west/south indoors or north/east outdoors since you can't really see in those spots. Hopefully they wouldn't do that but the thought is just annoying.  6. I've played about 10 hours I may pick it up again and change the review if it turns out better. After reading about the foraging skill, barter skill, level cap, etc I lost interest.  "
293180,Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf,"Worth it for the soundtrack, the game is mediocre at best"
293200,Sentinel,"This game is the rez of tower defense. Your tower placement affects the music (imagine the screen as one large step sequencer) as well as events like tower shots, dying enemies, etc.  The gameplay is heavy in micromanagement. Most of the strategy involves shifting power between your towers according to enemy placement. I found it to be tedious. I'd rather play defense grid where I place or upgrade towers and forget about them.  I barely played it, but I disliked the core gameplay mechanism. If you want a great game+music experience, play rez."
293220,H-Hour: World's Elite, Early Access Review
293240,Cosmochoria,"Cute game, kills time pretty well"
293260,Card Hunter,"Card hunter is in essence okay, a good deal of grinding and luck is required to get far, the key word is luck, you can get super ♥♥♥♥♥ cards and be skrewed in a boss match. when i played i did sense a bit of a money grubbing, and it was off putting. The main reason the game lost my interest though was simply one thing, it was too repetitive, it was basically the same thing every time to me, and it stopped being fun. look if you have an interest in grinding games, which i know some people do i would say try it out, otherwise i would say play another game"
293320,Coma: Mortuary,"THIS GAME IS A SCAM.  -FOV is 60. disgusting tunnel vision. -the flashlight is the only source of light, enhancing the tunnel vision. -SCREEN TEARING IS ALWAYS HERE. there is no vsync. -can not remap keys. -some buttons IN THE OPTION MENU HAVE NO TEXT AND DO NOTHING! wtf? -pausing game does not pause audio or dialogues. -random deaths (literally, I got killed in a random manner, for no reason, in an empty corridor without warning). -spooky elements despawn. the first spooky element are mummies... which despawn like 3 seconds after you see them. (and if you walk to the empty place, you die. uwotm8) -motion blur looks weird. -cutscenes are locked to 30fps. -literally walking simulator"
293340,The Good Life,Nice relaxing game for those moments when you are tired of killing zombies. Sometimes you will feel like Ruy Lopez de Villalobos (not the chess master) exploring the Philippines.
293420,Heldric - The legend of the shoemaker,-1
293440,Elliot Quest,"I really wanted to like this game, but it's just a terribly frustrating experience. Pick up something I presume to be a potion, what is it? No idea. Consume it, nothing happens. Huh, I guess it's a health potion as I was at full health and nothing happened. Doesn't matter, as you will never find another one. Pick up a scroll, what does it do? No idea, as it's not even in your inventory. Pick up some sort of amphora vase, game text tells me I better keep it at home.. mmm, ok? But it's not in my inventory! And I won't even go into the rest.. Frankly, I'd like my money back.."
293460,I Shall Remain,"I really wanted to like this game. I like the diablo combat style and what not but unfortunately the graphics are killing it. Not graphics quality, I honestly don't care about that at all. Its just that its so difficult to see anything. The first level just about killed me. Its so dark and I turned up all the brightness settings that I could think of and its just too dark. Its a strain just to make out any detail at all. When the flashes of lightning sort of illuminate the level, thats what I wish the game would have actually looked like. But its just a half second every now and then. The sewer level is a slight improvement but not much better. If there were day/night cycles or something and I could choose when to explore, that would be different. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be that way.   Its not that it makes it difficult, its just frustrating and not fun at all when you have to strain to see anything. All the small graphical detail appears to be actually pretty good, too bad most of the time you can't see ANY of it because of the darkness. Everything else seems very good...the levels, guns, loot, etc. If they change the lighting, i'll change the review to positive.  And yes I know about the aging effect meter. It doesn't fix the problem."
293480,FRONTIERS, Early Access Review
293520,Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn,"Let me begin by saying that Carnivores and Carnivores 2 were my all time favorite games as a kid. I spent an irresponsible amount of time playing those games.  I saw yesterday that there was a remake of the game on Steam and almost fell over from excitement. I was disappointed for the most part after putting seriously hundreds of hours into Carnivores 1 and 2.   Pros - I respect that they kept a lot of the features from the original games. The weird hovercrafts that take you to and from the game, the trophy room, even the map names. - The upgradability of your weapons and character is neat, but the pursuit of upgrades seems to be the only driving force of the game.   Cons - The graphics are very cartoony, I'd honestly prefer the original graphics - The frame rate is capped somewhere between 30 and 50. I shouldn't be getting 40fps on a gtx1080. It stomps on the immersiveness of the game. - The dinosaurs are laughably huge. So large in fact that the smallest dinosaur cannot easily run away from you in the woods because it's colliding with too much of the foliage. - They cut the number of weapons in half - The number of huntable dinosaurs was also cut in half. Which is a huge deal breaker. - Gameplay feels like it should be a mobile game  I really wanted to love this game. And I'll continue playing it until I've unlocked all of the maps and all of the upgrades, but I'm going to stop immediately after that. Why? because there's no incentive to play after that. I am forecasting a lonely 4 hours of collective gameplay to finish. For the price, that isn't that bad. But it does not live up to the original games."
293540,Guns and Robots,Developers stopped working on it a looooong time ago so it got old fast do not play
293600,Arson & Plunder: Unleashed,"Most of the reviews claim this game is clunky as well as looking and feeling like a mobile port and honestly, they aren't wrong. The combat feels slow, the character feels unresponsive and unruly. Whos bright idea was it to have the jump and attack be the same button? Moron  I do admire the game for one thing though, it knows how bad it is as at the end of every mini level the default selection is to exit, that's brilliant."
293660,TRI: Of Friendship and Madness,"This game is brilliant!  It contained some of the most innovative and mind-blowing mechanics and puzzles I've encountered so far in my history of gaming. Not even Portal nor Antichamber made me love their puzzles and mechanics as much as TRI.  The artstyle is beautiful, the soundtrack is enchanting, the puzzles are challenging and the level design is super creative!  Definitely one of the best games I have stumbled upon in recent years!"
293680,Cinders,"It's not bad. Sort of like a text based adventure game. I didn't mind the changes to the original story, and I love the fact that you can make Cinders into a complete b*tch. Fun times. The art is fairly nice also, especially that of the backgrounds, sisters, fairy, and Ghede. Not sure if it would appeal to many people, but I'm one of those that must try to get all endings.  3.5-4/5 maybe. Depending what you're into. I recommend to play this game at least once, assuming the fondness for these sorts of games."
293720,Dark Raid,Better than CoD Ghosts!
293740,Road Not Taken,"I loved this god damn game so much. Some parts would be so damn hard, but the end was so rewarding."
293760,Automation - The Car Company Tycoon Game, Early Access Review
293780,Crawl, Early Access Review
293840,Cult of the Wind,"Picked up for free. Looked kinda cute. Install. 'Customise' character (total of 8 options). Look for game. Hmm, only one game - dedicated server... Number of players - 0. Can't even play with myself.    Cult of the Wind - 0/16 (players) Running around my desk making airplane noises - priceless."
293860,White Noise Online,"  Is your life in a rut and you need something to make your life less dull? Check out this game! You will have a lot to do! That's right, you can take a hike while a monster is chasing you! He won't attack though, he'll just watch you trough the trees and somehow you die slowly while you look at him. Excitement! Multiplayer is also a thing! Atleast if you want to try it 500 times and get kicked for no reasons!  Al in all this game is so great that I'll give it a thumbs down, to be honest writing this review was more exciting than playing the game. This game is 5 euro's in a normal state, 5 fign euro's! how? Do yourself a favor, do not buy it!"
293880,Dark Scavenger,  Great game for it's length
293900,Pivvot,"Hoped for something as demanding and hypnotic as Super Hexagon, but no, got bored very quickly..."
293920,Spirited Heart Deluxe,"I thought I was gonna like this game.... and I guess I kinda do, but still.... TEH GRINDING. WTF.   I wish Steam would let me pick a neutral rating b/c I have enjoyed parts of it.... so thumbs up there. But it's also been a pedantic, pain in the ars.e to play too. So thumbs down at the same time. Hence my neutral feels.   I will mark it negative for now I guess.... ;___; Sorry WW....I like your other games tho.   But yeah... some of the characters are really endearing, but most are just annoying asf. Reid? (Makes me think of bug spray LOL) she was really hawt, yah, but her personally really sucked. Same with the hawt demon tailor chick. She had potential. I guess the dev was goin for dominatrix vibez with her? She was just a c.u.nt. Pardon my French... Yana was the only character I felt for, and even then, it was difficult to progress beyond more than 1 heart for her....mostly due to LACK OF RANDOM ENCOUNTERS. Protip: Easy Mode is still brutal. Cannot fathom playing Normal mode unless there's something I am missing here regarding game mechanics (??)  Guy-wise, the only dude who I sorta kinda liked was Frebo, but it was frustrating b/c I wanted to talk to him more and the damn game wouldn't let me. I kept doing the Schoolgirl job route...to try to talk to him.....but I never got random encounters with him, just tons with that annoying demon girl Hade (how in the frack do you pronounce that name anyway? Hay-dee? Hay-day? @_@;;) She was the flattest character ever... at least from my brief interaction. Emphasis on brief.   tl;dr Game seems more focused on stat building than relationship building. If you're an accountant, you may get a massive number-boner from this game. Otherwise... meh.   PS: I did notice a minor flaw in the programming of this game.... I met the male demon character in the bar when I was working as a waitress, and then I saw him a 2nd time working as a maid, and on my 2nd encounter, the game had no idea I already met him once before, so it was the same kinda introduction-y stuff all over again. Would suggest somehow making it trigger something once you meet a character so you don't re-introduce.... but IDK how hard that is to do, code-wise. Just a suggestion/honest feedback!!  PPS: Minor gripe here but wish we could change the MC's hair color/eye color/outfit/etc. My elf girl looked like she was living in the '80s in a bad way for most of this game, LOL. :-P"
293940,Kill The Bad Guy,"It's a fun, strategic, puzzle-esque style game where you get to blow off steam while killing bad guys in whatever manner you feel fit given the resources in each scenario."
293980,Baron Wittard,my game has sound with a black screen
294000,Knight Squad,"This game was fun, but you have to have friends or people to play with for it to fun."
294020,Merchants of Kaidan,  Personally I'd say look for a better simulator for this type of game. None the less I got it for free so card selling is profit.
294040,Loot Hero DX,"Recommended only for achievement hunters, you can get 100% completion in a couple of hours really, which is why I bought it in the first place. If looking for a good game, then this is not for you.  + Easy achievements + Quick playthrough (not more than 2 hours) + Dirt cheap specially in a sale - Grindy - Gameplay basically non-existent  - Visually crap"
294060,Aaru's Awakening,Incredible old school art and incredibly old school difficult.
294100,RimWorld, Early Access Review
294140,They Breathe,"This is an interesting experience. Impressive music,visuals and especially ambience. It was an awakening experience though, I am the frog."
294160,Galcon 2,"It's free, fun and annoyingly addictive. Don't expect to win your first few games."
294190,A-Men 2,"Sequels are suppose to be better then the first one, and I gave the first on a whim a positive review. This time however the game will not be so lucky as the sequel was actually worse then the original and as such, I have to give it a thumbs down."
294230,Millie,"It is almolst like nibbly my old game, what I really enjoyed playing. There is a few thing what keeps me annoying. First during the game, the monitor keeps moving, zooming, which makes me feel dizzy. Second, there are some extra plays in it, where you pilot an airplane and had to draw the sign. What is not really reallistic. Third, during the game there are some light effects which are annoying. I was really happy when I bought this game, but not happy after I played with it."
294280,Scooby-Doo! & Looney Tunes Cartoon Universe: Adventure,This game is a fun and relaxing romp through a cartoon world. It's a short playthrough with tight controls and some nice environments. I'd recommend picking it up on sale - it goes down to $5 USD reasonably often.
294370,Crowntakers,A really nice Game..  Highly Recommended for turn-based game lovers..
294390,Escape The Lost Kingdom: The Forgotten Pharaoh,"I had to look up online to see if that really was the end, or if I had died... inope t was really the end. This is half a game that doesn't even touch upon the story it opens. Don't waste your time even when of offer."
294440,Shadowgate,A significant historic learning tool. Did you know that in a world without electricity or fire everyone would be dead by nightfall? In the dark you can't walk about without your bones becoming hollow bird skeletons and suffering overwhelming vertigo. In the olden days people had to lie down by sunset or risk severe and/or fatal injury. With 8-12 hours of blind inactivity people began to lose consciousness in order to cope with the boredom. Thus sleep was invented.  If you don't believe this try standing on one leg in the middle of your room with your eyes shut.  Best torch simulator I've ever played.  I give it a solid 7 lit torches out of a possible 10 because I need the other three to survive the night.
294460,Fenix Rage,"In short it's like Super Meat Boy as Flappy Bird in a Sonic costume - story, level select, level design and cool rock-heavy music are like Super Meat Boy - movement is like Flappy Bird with infinite dash - difficulty is much easier than Super Meat Boy, but it's challenging to beat the level's 'best time' - hidden secrets to be found  Awesome! I enjoy it a lot!"
294530,Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse,used to play this game as a kid now im 18 and this game made me just as frustrated as my 5 year old self
294540,Freddi Fish 3: The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell,"Its not a phase mom, this game is the embodiment of who i am. Ever since i opened that cinnamon toast crunch box my identity was born."
294550,Freddi Fish 4: The Case of the Hogfish Rustlers of Briny Gulch,"10/10 and GOTY, no doubts."
294570,Freddi Fish 5: The Case of the Creature of Coral Cove,"the story was a bit off but the character development was even worse. the graphics were better than the older games but not good enough. the game was fun tho, could be better if it had harder difficulties. want to see more of the franchise, hoping it would be better. "
294580,Freddi Fish and Luther's Water Worries,"So first the loading screen looks like some ♥♥♥♥ out off a 90s windows desktop computer on ms paint, then i see these two fish having a ♥♥♥♥ing picnic in water? and this little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gets sucked in a gaping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and shoots bubbles with his ♥♥♥♥ing slingshot? story = 0/10 animation = 0/10 and the sound effects sound like some brony is cumming all over his mlp porn pics"
294590,Wars and Warriors: Joan of Arc,This game is the reason I joined Steam. One of the best games ever. :)
294650,Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon,"Bought this game because PBG played it, 21/12 because of the purple car guy"
294660,Putt-Putt Saves The Zoo,"On the opening day of the zoo, Putt-Putt causes an avalanche, falls down a waterfall and almost gets eaten by an aligator. Great game for kids!"
294670,Putt-Putt Travels Through Time,This game allowed me to 'travel through time' back to my childhood. I'm fairy certain the Train who pays Putt Putt to spurt oil on him is up to no good. Wish the game would never end 100/10
294680,Putt-Putt Enters the Race,Finished the game in about an hour. It didn't work on my laptop for some reason (it glitched out a lot) but I ended up re-downloading it onto a different computer where it worked. So much nostalgia...
294690,Putt-Putt Joins the Circus,"I sacrificed my newborn child for this game, worth it."
294700,Putt-Putt: Pep's Birthday Surprise,  so far. putt putt has been one of the weirdest games my friend has sent to me. this game is giving me a headache and ear aid. but besides the toxic voice and the weird and not well explain stuff.jk. this game is pretty trash.jk. it an alright game for like 3 year olds or for kids like in child development.     10/.01 -ign would maybe recommend
294710,Putt-Putt and Pep's Dog on a Stick,"The large degree of randomness in the later levels and stages being rendered unwinnable due to the randomness is not really worth fighting past; I don't think a kid would enjoy this game because often, failure is not your fault. Otherwise, it's kind of just Qbert. The collecting stuff part is optional and I just made a beeline to the goal playing through the entire game. 100 levels is probably a longer challenge if you actually cared about the points but there's no reason to. Probably the best of the arcades I've played up to this point, but that doesn't make it 'good'."
294720,Putt-Putt and Fatty Bear's Activity Pack,This game is great for hours of fun.
294730,Marine Park Empire,I like making enclosures full of nothing but giant squids.
294750,Anomaly Defenders,"Lacking ideas, and with a weak 'story'. The lack of respect the programmers have shown to their 3rd go at this is to me exemplified by the fact that the 'alien' avatar is a hypersexualised 'female' robot torso. Classy. And logical of course."
294770,Haegemonia: Legions of Iron,"I really tried, it seemed like it had a lot going for it. The controls and the interface are just so damn obtuse though that I can not enjoy it. If the menus provided better information and if the controls were actually customizable beyond only the barest options I'd give it another shot."
294790,Haegemonia: The Solon Heritage,Good expansion to a pretty decent game back when expansions actually included an assload of content. This game borrowed a lot of ideas from Homeworld and threw in some of it's own. I've always felt that Sins of A Solar Empire devs took some inspiration from this game.    NOTE: Google and download Haegemonia sound fix   FIRST   .     Doubtful this bug will ever be fixed as I don't even think Digital Reality even exists as a company anymore (their website seems ♥♥♥♥ed and they haven't developed a full game of their own in nearly 6 years).  
294830,RECYCLE,If this game just had a spectator mode so I could watch my trucks while they are on autopilot this might be worth keeping around but as is I either have drive everything my self or just stare at the garage while they are out on autopilot. The last update was over a year ago so I doubt that will be corrected.
294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,Company of Waifus: Sugoi Tales  Pretty mediocre though 2bh. You can easily finish the game using only 2 units.
295250,Stranded,"Full gameplay walkthrough here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIdZP_JTtwk   Not a game, more like an art piece where you have to slowly walk left and right, repeatedly for a while."
295590,Hero Generations,"So I loved this game when it came out, was loads of fun for 20$ or however much it was at launch. Was browing my games for something to play and remembered this, then recalled I had a coupon in my inventory for hero generatios. Was thinking about getting collectors and playing it again, if that's what coupon was for...  Little to my knowladge this game was abandoned for them to remake it and add a lot of features that were missing from this 1... Scumbag move Dev's, and people gave Wild Card hate for their honestly amazing DLC that was made by an entierly seperate team, while main team kept working on main game. The only game that comes to mind for scumbag dev's is The War Z...  Which I had bought a legendary pass to its kickstarter because it was going to be worlds better then dayZ, right up until they ♥♥♥♥ed it up. Added Microtransactions, got lots of hate and abandonment. Then renamed the game, kept going for a while, before most of the programer team quits to remake it again forgot that trainwreck's name, before Pimp w/e the Dev's remade and renamed it yet again. All of these were sold seperatly, but the first 2 could still play with original version, but lost all the ♥♥♥♥ you payed extra for."
295610,Inescapable,Here I thought I was going to get a nice old retro-tyope game and all I got was disapointment.   Don't waste money on this. Bearly a story and controls only work when they feel like it. &gt;:[
295630,Defense Zone 2,"What a load of crap. The enemy units will start anywhere along the path.  You place you towers near the start of the path, expecting the enemy to all start at the start. Then with no warning, you will be defeated simply because the idiot developers decided that it is ok for the enemy to start at any poing along the path!  DO NOT BUY!!!"
295670,Hive Jump, Early Access Review
295690,PARTICLE MACE,"Five second review: I'm hooked. Controls feel good on an Xbox controller, lots of little missions to complete.  Edit: Release version now has an ad launcher. I have to change my review to negative."
295710,Darkwind: War on Wheels,"I for one, don't think this is as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as everyone claims it is. After all I only dumped $30k in game cash into buying a Phoenix and a 4L engine.   No I'm not jealous that I don't have a 4L V8.  Ok maybe I am."
295730,Sweezy Gunner,"Judging from it's title, I didn't really knew what to expect until I actually started looking into it. I was amazed and delightfully surprised to find out it's quite an awesome game.. It's basically a bullet hell shooter which takes place in a large open world which in my opinion sounds more like bullet heaven. You get dropped into some world with just one goal.. seek and destroy. You'll get some basic tips to learn the mechanics but that's it. How you wish to explore and complete your mission is all up to you.  You'll be dodging a rain of bullets, collecting a great array of power-ups, killing bosses for new skills, collecting coins to purchase new upgrades and basically leaving a trail of mayhem and destruction everywhere you go in this vast open world. All this whilst rocking out to an amazing DnB soundtrack makes for some non-stop frantic action.  Definitely a great game for any shoot em up fan and most certainly worth it's price."
295750,The Floor is Jelly,"I was very impressed with the game presentation at the Steam store. So I had lots of expectations from this game.  At first, I was not disappointed. The game looks very beautiful, and the gameplay is novel. The first few levels feel like a pleasant discovery and the game begins with quite a promising look.  But this died soon. The controls are kind of wonky, and you respawn too fast and too close to death pits. Too many times you'll die even before you notice, so you eventually have to stop and wait for the jelly to settle, which is kind of disappointing.  As the game proceeds, the puzzles change. However later on they get quite unintuitive. The game has no verbal communication with the player, and the tutorial level for the final puzzles (i.e., the first and most simple level to employ this new puzzle type) is not enough to explain exactly how you are supposed to interact with the jelly. It becomes a game of trial and error, and a bit of luck."
295770,Rogue Shooter: The FPS Roguelike,"At first glance, I did not expect much from this game. As a person with a background in both FPS games and roguelikes, I was not sure where the game would take both genres. Needless to say, the game delivers a fun and replayable experience that is reminiscent of old-school shooter games such as Doom and Wolfenstein 3D.  Lots of customisability, lots of replayability, and for a price like this, what else can you ask for?  Pros: - Solid balanced gameplay - Well structured core mechanics - Simple to grasp controls and features - Relatively cheap price  Cons: - Old school shooter format may dissuade some people from buying the game - Some attacks (melee only) can feel clunky due to forced movement  I would recommend this game."
295790,Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna),"I loved this game so much, such a beautiful and an emotional story and really exciting to play. -Beautiful art -Awesome insights -Great story -Buy on sale, only 2-3€! "
295870,The Dungeoning,"Kinda disappointed.   The good: The atmosphere is kinda like Unepic, which is always fun. Medieval. Nice lighting effects, particle effects, blood spatters, treasure chests, etc..   The bad: Character movement doesn't really feel right, almost like skating just so you'll accidentally bump into that next monster around the corner or falling ceiling block. Maybe I'm just more adjusted to games that aren't trying so hard to get you killed.   There's no 'save and exit' option. What if you're just tired of playing? Is it roguelike because it's supposed to be roguelike or is it because they couldn't figure out how to store character and inventory data?   There are only 16 levels with 4 variations.   You can't destroy traps, even with explosives.   It's difficult to tell which item/weapon is more powerful. Sure you can attack boxes, plants, etc.. to test swords, but it's very hard to tell just exactly what rings do, and their descriptions don't help much. Neither do the not-so-helpful abbreviations.  There's not really any point to spending your levels on anything other than defense.   At the end is a big sparkly chest with a trophy in it. You unlock new game+. I doubt I'll ever want to finish that. It seemed like it was a little more difficult, but I can't see any point in playing through again.   Bottom Line: There's nothing here to keep me coming back. It might keep you busy for 2 hours, but it will ultimately feel like a hollow and unrewarding effort.  If you want a more RPG-like side-scrolling game, then you might prefer Unepic. If you'd rather throw a few minutes of your life away while feeling completely unrewarded, then go ahead with this game.   It wouldn't be bad at $2, but $5.99 is a ripoff, which is what I paid. It's too bad Steam doesn't offer refunds.   Other notes:   Keys. What's the point with all these keys? What if I run out? Will I be unable to move on? I hope there's at least one on each level. But really the keys seem mostly pointless unless there's always at least one per level in an attempt to make you get the key before moving on.  Edit: I did run out of chest keys, but I believe there is always a door key on every level."
295910,Olympia Rising,I´m a metroidvana fan and waited for this to be released. But sadly I really don´t like it. Not metroidvania like. Poor controls and hitboxes. You have to collect enough coins to exit an area. Sometimes scrolling screens where you have to avaid the rising water. Damn hard difficulty and boing gameplay. Got my refund on steam.  (+This is not a game simelar to 'Battle of Olympus'!! Don´t expect that gameplay.)
295930,Swipecart,"YOU CANNOT GET ALL ACHIEVEMENTS IN THIS GAME LEGITIMATELY. Level 2-8 is impossible to 100% because of a crystal right after the acceleration area that you cannot pick up because it's in the ground. Unless you approach it really slowly (1.5mph) roll over forward just after leaving the start area so that your face picks it up, and then you slowly slide forward if you rolled just far enough onto sloped ramp. But then snowballs will kill you. There's also a bug - if you pause the game, snowballs and boulders will keep spawning. Unpause after a long while and suddenly boulders will be everywhere. You can use this to get pushed forward if you rolled over and got stuck before the slope starts. But.. you'll still die, getting pushed off the cliff by snowballs. Also, Level 3-10 has improperly configured cannons.  As far as gameplay goes, it's tedious and repetitive. Only 30 players ever made it to the last level. No doubt because everyone quits after the first few levels. The levels quickly get stupidly hard. Blood, sweat, tears and nerves of steel.. That's what it takes to finish all levels 100%.  This game wasn't made for PC.. Porting it to PC, the developer should at least enable the use of larger resolution - so that you see more playfield, instead of scaling pixels. Improperly scaling, at that. I thought it'd be easy achievements, but.. forget about it. 20 hours of my life wasted."
295990,Evopollution,"this game is very glitched crashes easy, even when you go to load it screen stays white n doesnt load for ever. I bought it on sale a neat concept but would have been nice if it worked and they've had forever to fix it and havnt. I wouldnt recommend this game unless under 0.50 n thats just for trading cards get money back"
296010,NeonXSZ,feels like playing a newer version of descent.... barf bag still not included
296050,Battlepaths,"I think I have to give this game a thumbs up. Pretty sure I got this as part of a bundle, and initially installed it just to generate the trading cards, but ended up playing it for longer than I expected. If I didn't already have a hundred other games I bought screaming for my attention, I'd probably keep playing. Not much of a story, but the simple gameplay mechanics and the weapon looting and upgrading thing made it easy to pick up."
296070,MIND Path to Thalamus E.Edition,"This is very 'specific' game. It is like [Story-Driven-But-Hidden] and [No-One-Explains-You-Anything]. Really, in the first level it took me a lot of time to understand what I have to do to proceed. I like the visuals a lot (though some parts are beautiful but some parts also ugly) but I don't like the voice acting. Overall puzzles are easy to not-so-easy but not very challenging.  Pros: - Beautiful visuals (mostly). - Good music. - Interesting journey through various landscapes. - Very good atmosphere.  Cons: - Voice acting (That guy who voiced the narrator is hard to listen to - it is somewhat silent). - Stupid nad unintuitive movement in the menu - I'm used to press ESC when I want to return to menu one level up but in this game it just kill the game and you have to start it again (an that happens when you press ESC ANYTIME in menu). - It is not possible to change graphics or whatever when you are playing - you have to leave the game to the setting menu, change what you want and then start chapter again."
296150,G-Ball,"  1 year ago my friend told me these exact words, 'One day, im gonna gift you a game on steam so bad your eyes fall out.' When he gifted me this i thought nothing of it since he had gifted me things before. We started a skype call and were talking for a bit until he mentioned the gift. I told him that i accepted it and he said that we should play it. I started up the game and saw that it said i was the only person online in the whole world playing, until he logged on. We started playing and slowly i could feel my eyes falling out of their sockets. I quickly closed the game remembering what he had said one year before. We havent talked since.        But overall a midly adequate game"
296180,Iron Storm,Although the graphics are dated the game play and story line sure aren't.
296210,Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,"If you're a 7.62 high caliber player, you might be asking why you would bother getting this when it just looks like an early tech demo for 7.62  It is infact, the superior game as far as mechanics are concerned. E5 is woefully unpolished, it has bugs (not game-breaking thankfully) and the story is incomprehnsible and the graphics are worse, but it has several features that make it a better play than its sequel.  For one thing, the town maps are more varied and actually feature large numbers of ENTERABLE BUILDINGS with multiple floors and rooms, that the AI will fight you in, as opposed to 7.62s hodepodge of jungle lanes and concrete blob maps with maybe 3 buildings with one room in the entire game. This CQB element can be frustrating, but rewarding as it adds a new and welcome dimension to the gameplay.  Secondly, suppressive fire actually works in E5. AI will drop the ground and lose accuracy under barrages of fire, a feature which claims to exist in 7.62 but is actually absent when you examine it.  And for such an unpolished game, it surprisingly has less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t going on than 7.62, dont have to worry about AI magically appearing through walls behind you here, if they're in a building, they're either coming out, or you're going in."
296220,Farm Frenzy 4,"Challenging. When I got this I thought, easy no brainer and easy achievements. Umm, yeah about that easy, no brainer, it was deceiving. Its a great game!"
296240,The Promised Land,"This is a casual game. Probably originally built on mobile and ported over. If you can get it for under $5, do it. It's fun for a few hours until you beat."
296280,TownCraft,"As the name suggests this is a blend of Minecraft and a town simulator, using 2D ISO graphics instead of a proper 3D engine.  Punch a tree, pick up a rock, make an axe, cut down trees, quarry rocks, build structures, and so on.  Works okay in 4K, graphics are a bit weird (trees aren't polyhedral, guys). Lack of DPI scaling makes the game text difficult to read in UHD.   Unfortunately it's quite buggy and may take you several crash/reloads to get through the tutorial. Other games do the same stuff with better graphics and more stability, so thumbs down ensues."
296300,Ballistic Overkill, Early Access Review
296470,Mount Your Friends,"It used to be kind of fun, but now it is not."
296490,GemCraft - Chasing Shadows,"I have played all the versions of gemcraft and they become better and better. Gemcraft Labyrinth was perhaps equal to this one. I played the limited free flash versions. So I picked this up on a bargain and played with access to all the elements of the game, and it is nearly poorer than the limited version. And I am sad to give it a negative review. For these reasons: It's strong suit is that you can scale the difficulty quite well by cranking up the challenge. However if you get good at it you end up with getting to big of a reward for this and with the added bonus you get from things the pay version it soon becomes to easy. You advance way too fast and nothing becomes more of a challenge than you make it and even that becomes hard after a while. By playing skilled through maybe a third of the stages you can easily just click 'send all' on the rest of them and finish them in seconds, if you like. The above would be fine if you could actually scale the challenge up, but can't because it lags really bad after a certain point. My rig isn't the best of rigs, but it plays worse than the web browser flash version. So at some point you start not play the best you can, but rather at how you can avoid lag. Which only works so far before that also more or less breaks down because even that becomes easy. Then it is the graphics itself, I kind of expected this to be scaleable so that it would render to any screen resolution. It doesn't, so if you go full screen (which increase lags) it is gets grainy and blurred.  If you have never played it and it is a bargain I can recommend it for the time you spend to learn it, which is enjoyable and less laggy. Also if you have played previous free versions and wanna throw Game in a Bottle a few coins. And maybe the iron wizard mode is enjoyable which cranks up the challenge by removing some of the things that made the series great."
296510,Magnetic By Nature,"Interesting mechanics, decent idea, not a fan of the execution. That being said I did play all the way through the game. But overall didn't enjoy the experience."
296530,Coldfire Keep,"This is a game I wanted to like, but the game simply would not let me.  I can deal with the unpolished visuals. I expected it to look like a mobile game.  The controls are slow and clunky. You are often waiting for whatever time cycle to pass before you can enter another command. Sure, the pauses are generally small, but the frustration adds up. Plus, the default swipe movements are always there, so you can end up accidentally moving while trying to activate levers or pick up objects.  You can use the 1-4 keys to make attacks, an improvement on Legend of Grimrock which is click only, but half of the default party are spell casters and there are no keyboard shortcuts for spells.  And if you accidentally cast a spell with no possible target? You're still stuck waiting for everyone to return to 'idle' state so you can move again.  You also start with almost no equipment. You can pick up a few items laying around an intro area, but when the first fight arrived only half my party had weapons. By the time everyone was wiped out by some golem thing, my shaman had yet to find a weapon and so all they could do was cast Heal and twiddle their thumbs.  There is also the inane conversation between the party members. It's better than talking to the two crazy ladies who run an inn and a shop in a dungeon, but that isn't really saying much.  Yet despite all the time spent on text and conversation, there are other areas that are blatantly ignored when it comes to prose. For instance, the areas you enter and teleport to/from are things like '2a' and '1'. It just struck me as odd. There is also no real explanation of what game items are and how they work. Why do I have rations? No idea. Why can't the shaman wield a staff? No clue.  All in all, this game just isn't worth $5."
296550,Niko: Through The Dream,"Pretty, but amateurish. The hand drawn animation that starts the game looks like it was made by a 10 year old. Almost none of the settings are configurable, including mapping buttons, so you'll be moving around the maps using arrow keys like you're playing on a Commodore 64. Don't bother complaining in the forums about the game's shortcomings, the developer just deletes the posts without responding and bans you from the forum for pointing out problems with the game. I'll be requesting my refund from Steam.  tl;dr - Niko: Through The Dream is a waste of money."
296570,Lords of Xulima,"Horrible, just horrible. Terrible game play and the graphics remind me of the first RPG I played in the late 90's. I feel like I've been ripped off by this game. I know this isn't Steam's fault, but I feel like I've been let down, I feel like Steam's quality control process should not allow horrible games like this into the store.  The combat system is a joke, the loot mechanics are silly. The people who made this game should feel bad about what they've done. Everything about this game feels lazy and 'phoned in' as if their only intention was dup'ing idiots like me into spending $20 for something I can't return.  This has seriously turned me away from purchasing games on Steam. I think I'm going to stick with dumping my money into mobile games. The mobile games may be just as much of a scam as this low-rent robbery, but at least they're up front about their scam and their games don't look like highschool grade, first draft garbage.  I would not recommend this game to anyone."
296590,Draconian Wars,"I've just started playing this game, but wow. This game is EXACTLY like Decipher's SWCCG. Even down to drawing battle destiny with 4 or more ability.  Fairly poor for an online CCG - quickest way to get cards seems to be just instantly starting and conceeding every match. Not bad to simply play solo vs. the computer but I don't see this going well or being fun online in multiplayer."
296630,Kraven Manor,"The game itself it's pretty simple and easy, beat the game at max difficulty diying only 2 times. I'm not going to lie I got scared many times and i felt the tension every second. But I have to say NO! Because of the price. 6 dollars it's way to much for a game that can be fully completed in less than an hour. If you don't mind the price give it a try, it's worth playing."
296650,The Great Jitters: Pudding Panic,this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad i cant even begin to fathom what the devs were ♥♥♥♥ing when they made this trash. thank  edit: after extensive research on the great jitters i can confirm that this game is still ♥♥♥♥ing trash edit2: fuick this game  edit3: just nominated for absolute trash award hit it up guys
296710,Monstrum ," Warning: I didn't try this in VR. So don't expect any VR related info. You rich bastrds   Fun game overall! The initial presentation is a bit weak- Kinda just drops you in without saying anything, and it's not the most beautiful game ever (especially for 2015) but the core gameplay keeps bringing me back, even after getting 100% achievements (which some could argue is the only way to to truly complete this kind of game). It's the RNG on item spawning that makes for some great replayability. There's definitely room for some more enemy variety   (I would've tried pushing for at least like 5 different monsters instead of just 3; The Brute, The Psychic, and The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Face)   but it's better than just having one. Love the ways you can ♥♥♥♥ with them with the different items you find on the ship. The unsettling/intense atmosphere does a pretty good job at keeping you on edge, can really get your heart racing whether in VR or not. There is a story, but it's not one that you are really engaged in where there's a distinct beginning and end. Well, you do get an ending... if you survive  mwuahahaha . Honestly though, the story is the one thing in this game I didn't care for, even the multiple endings factor of it. The core gameplay is good enough it can literally hold up without one.  So yeah, Overall fun game, I recommend especially if on sale"
296730,Viktor,"Fun way to kill some time, as well as quite a few other things. A bit glitchy, but I found nothing that really hampered gameplay. Mostly just funny things you take screenshots of. Storyline isn't the best... But then you get a rocketlauncher with an endless ammo buff. The art isn't bad. the challenges are challenging. The level design is pretty good. I do recomend this game, despite its flaws."
296770,Real Boxing™,ughhhh.. i got dooped into buying this one. been waiting for a boxing game on pc for a long time. had high hopes when i saw this. if you have ever played any of the fight night games then 'real' boxing will suck for you. pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that i wasted 8 bucks on it. dont waste your time or money.
296810,Jump Tanks, Early Access Review
296830,Lucius II,"I've just killed a man sitting on a toilet, electrifying him.  10/10"
296850,Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine,"This is the only game I know where the game within a game is the game itself!  Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine is not my favourite Adventure Game. The story lacks the weight that would drive a more serious plot; there's no underlying urgency or driving force. As a result, I felt like I could stop at any time.  With that said, I enjoyed the humor and the story quite a bit, more than enough to see the game through to the end. I also enjoyed the growth of the protagonist from a shallow and pitiable (but likable) character into a much stronger and more complex individual.  There are also other things I liked about the game. The puzzles are solid, challenging and enjoyable. The artwork is simply stunning. The supporting characters are fun and interesting. The music, while not particularly memorable, complemented the settings perfectly.  Overall, the only element I felt that had weakness was the story. Al Emmo would have benefited from having a darker undertone clearly woven into the story right from the beginning. This element would have contrasted the humor and ultimately strengthened it. In addition, the urgency that a darker element could provide would have given the story a drive that it lacked.  However, if you can get past this point, you'll find Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine to be a fun, humorous adventure, and an overall decent game."
296870,Dreaming Sarah,This game is short but sweet! An interesting platformer with an interesting dream world that sort of folds back in on itself as you play through. Reminds me of a light platformer version of Yume Nikki!
296930,Ascendant,Got this game in a bundle and it far exceeeded my expectations. Fantastic game!
296970,Renowned Explorers: International Society,"Renowned Explorers is a pretty great game, a really fun roguelike take on the Victorian-era exploration and adventure story. Interesting combat mechanics, very challenging at higher difficulties, and a ton of replayability."
297000,Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition,"Much like all games from ubisoft, it crashes all the time. Stick with just steam, Ubisoft."
297020,The Culling Of The Cows,This game is a masterpiece. One swift hit to the head can stop any mosin wielding nuisance
297060,Freaking Meatbags,Highly recommended if you like RTSs. This is a pretty fun game. The only drawback is the $10 price point. I'd wait for a sale.
297070,Nicolas Eymerich The Inquisitor Book II : The Village,"Oh my God. Where do I start. Maybe I should start with the Lord's prayer to absolve my purchase of this game. This game is not a game , it is a virtual flogging of your better judgement for pressing the 'add to cart' button. It is filled with nonsense, bad graphics, horrible controls, bugs galore and voice acting that will make you vomit. This is a TERRIBLE representation of the Adventure Genre. I cannot put into words how bad this game is. I played through the whole thing and I need to be asylumed for it. Lord forgive me for I have sinned. Take me now. "
297080,Navpoint, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UBEJdZCGcI 
297100,Beyond Space,"I'd rate it about 4/10 overall. It's a bit of fun. I bought for about £3 so I think I got value for my money. The interface is very clunky no matter the controller type. I found my programmable mouse a god send. Crsahed a couple of times, which was annoying, but it was rare. Selecting different inventory items really needs fixing its really hard to switch weapons etc. Just a mouse scroll would help. graphics dated but crisp 5/10, interface 2/10, gamplay average 4/10, duration 3/10 (8 hours), story line weak 3/10, cost low price £3ish so good 7/10.  I'd still recommend as a cheap game, but otherwise I'd slate it."
297110,Cosmic DJ,This is you while playing this game:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819900460 
297120,Heavy Bullets,"The game is neat for a while - about 4 or 5 hours worth of gameplay, but it quickly gets stale and repetitive. It's a novelty, not really worth buying unless you really enjoy the aesthetic for its own sake."
297130,Titan Souls,The definition of annoying.
297210,Famaze,"2D Roguelike, fun and with good music. It's okay for playing once in a while."
297270,Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire,"Long and short of it: This is a prime example of a crowdfunding failure.  I backed this game on Indiegogo, for a lot of money (hundreds of dollars), when the idea was first floated back in 2012. I was already a big fan of their pewter miniatures line for wargames, which basically took the place of Warhammer 40k 'Epic'/'Space Marine'/'Adeptus Titanicus' for me after Games Workshop shut those down. I was crazy excited and was happy to share my reward game keys with others and get them excited too.  Sadly it wasn't long before it became apparent the developer could not devote much time to the game at all, and you will see immediately the age of the engine. It's almost no different than it was back then. Some effort was put into some things, and very little in others. The splash screen is sophomoric and unit models are unadorned, some not even fully solid. There is no movement animation and the colors and textures are blurred and drab. I was momentarily impressed with some intro scenes and the tutorial narration but the rest looks very much like a high school project.  The developer didn't get his full funding on Indiegogo and decided to accept the partial payout, and still never delivered much of what was promised. The game is buggy and very shallow, with no multiplayer, despite showing good potential. The original website,  'FracturedEmpire.net'  is now just a parking site. I don't recommend anyone actually purchase the game ever again, because it will never be finished. Better to let it fade into obscurity.  Even so, I don't wish ill upon the developers, so long as they've learned their lesson. They still appear to be an active development house and hopefully the next thing they put out will have more effort and thought behind it. But they should not under any circumstances be trying to capitalize on this failure any longer. Have some dignity and let it die."
297290,Detective Case and Clown Bot in: Murder in the Hotel Lisbon,"This game is entertaining and easy to navigate. Graphics are decent, story is okay. You talk to people, collect items, then do interrogations where you ask the right question along with the right items. It's not hard to get through because there are no puzzles (you just need to collect items for interrogations and speak to the right people to progress). It gets a little tricky towards the end but with a little trial and error I figured things out."
297310,Pro Wrestling X, Early Access Review
297330,Arcadecraft,"I like these sorts of light management sims where you start with nothing and build up a business based on keeping ♥♥♥♥ fresh and meeting certain in game goals. This one is a little strange though in that the goals are not super clear and it seems kind of unpredictable about what will work and what won't. On top of that, I feel like the time progression is just a little bit too quick because you have to manage every machine in the arcade one at a time. It turns into one of those restaurant style sims after a certain point and I kind of lost interest quickly for the same reasons I do with those games.   I think the idea is pretty cool, though, but I would like a slower paced and more methodical approach to this concept because this just felt a little too frantic. Finally, the production values here are not extremely stellar and the upgrades you're allowed to make to your arcade for aesthetics and stuff just feel kind of cheap. I don't think it's a bad game overall, but I think it could have been a lot better."
297350,The Old City: Leviathan,I thought it was gorgeous and pretty deep. Best played if your slightly 'altered' for maximum mind eff. But yeah... Good game. WOOPWOOP
297410,Trace Vector,Very sexy take on the runner genre.
297450,Zombies on a Plane,"Jonathan: Yo ben... I bought this game for you Me: Not again, you already got me with Grass Simulator Jonathan: Nah dude, this game is the bees knees  ♥♥♥♥ you jonathan"
297470,Xsyon - Prelude, Early Access Review
297490,Spy Chameleon - RGB Agent,cool concept but gets boring. would be good as a mobile game.
297570,Warrior Kings,"  Awesome game, played it without steam before so I don't have many hours in it in steam. Its very underrated, I recognised it in the 2014 Winter Auction and got it for free. The story is very detailed and interesting for a game so obscure, this is like a proper triple A titile when it comes to the story, you'd expect it to be more popular and widely known. If you are thinking about getting this game I highly reccommend it, if you like RTS games with a nice story and fun gameplay you will love this.  Love this game 10/10"
297590,Monsters Ate My Birthday Cake,"Fun game, cute design and hilarious dialogues!  Monsters ate my birthday cake is packed with fluffy, cheeky and loveable monsters. While trying to solve quests, eat cake and save your village you get to know different monsters and their abilities AND you collect fancy monster outfits1!! And the best thing is: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!  PROS: everything but... CONS: ...the closed bakery òó WOULD PLAY AGAIN: 1139/1139 cake crumbs "
297620,Rocko's Quest,"an excellent way to check if you are still alive or trapped in a nightmare world, is to see if you have rocko's quest in your steam library. nightmares ward off rocko's quest"
297720,Corpse of Discovery,I beat the game in two hours so I would wait for a sale before purchase. Tho the game is short I loved it and could have kept playing for days and days.
297740,Overruled!,0.2 hours on record as multiplayer online does not work DONT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU EXPECT TO PLAY IT ONLINE
297750,Close Combat - Gateway to Caen,This is a good game. Great sound and effects. Very few games have a campaign and a tactic map to fight on.
297760,Qvadriga,"Nice idea, but the game gets repetitive very quickly. Also, I can stand games that aren't too impressive in terms of graphics, but the menu's all seem 90% finished. Actually, that's the whole story of the game, a small amount of extra detail and features would make this a nice little game that could give you a couple of hours of fun - now I just lost interest after a couple of races."
297860,Split/Second,"After a little under 2 hours, I decided to return this game. It felt slow and clunky. Oddly, despite all kinds of explosions and over-the-top visuals, it just didn't excite me at all. The vehicles handle okay, but it made me feel like I was in a plastic toy car, rather than something with a couple tons weight to it. And drifting seemed to slow you down more than be an efficient way to take corners. The audio was poor, even annoying at points. There's this weird, loud whooshing noise, specially in tunnels. It's not when you just barely miss something either. It's just... there. The music is just insultingly generic."
297920,Space Colony,I spent so many hours in this game. I am really happy it is available on steam now. Good classic.
29800,Caster,I only bought this game to make a profit on the trading cards. The game itself is just a boring garbage unity game. The Terrain deformation is cool though.
298020,Escape The Museum,"Recommended only for those who aren't frustrated by poor graphics. If you need everything to be perfectly clear and visible, stay away from this one.  According to the in-game stats, I completed the game in 6.1 hours at 96% accuracy. Little hint if you want to get 100% accuracy: the mouse pointer pulses when you are hovering over the correct item so let it hover for a second if you aren't sure you found the correct thing, then click only if it pulses.  I used 3 hints. One was at the very top of the screen 99% hidden by the user interface, almost unclickable. The other two were dark item on dark background kind of things that I had a great deal of trouble seeing even after using the hints.   This is an old title. Plays at 800x600 so don't expect to be able to clearly see all the things. The really small items are just blurry blobs.  The story is ok, tho I have to wonder at a woman who stops to collect 'treasures' while trying to get to her daughter after an earthquake, even if it is her job. I also have to wonder at her bosses definition of 'treasure'.  I turned off both the music and the voice, so I cannot say if they were any good or not.   I did enjoy the challenge, but I will likely not be playing again."
298030,Total Annihilation,"This is such a great game, it astounds me how such an old game is this good, i like how unique the art style is, and the gameplay is interesting, since it is in a way 3D a turret/unit's effectivness against certain units is less about reducing numbers against them and more about how often they can hit, AA guns deal no more damage to aircraft than other things but is the only thing that can reliably hit them. Because of this nothing seems forced and the game just works. this is a great game and i wish that more games today were like this."
298050,Master of Orion,"I honestly was not expecting a great deal from this game, but in retrospect I think I gave the game too little credit on my first glance. This is actually a rather plesant slimed down Turn-Based Strat game, so for those who want a Sci-Fi version of Tottal War, but with a more basic aproach then this is an ideal game for you. If you want something intensely complicated and in-depth then this is a game to make a pass on and take a look at Stelaris instead.  I found myself drawn into the more minor characteristics of the game rather than the main mechanics. For one, I have to say the character visualizations in diplomacy is extremely well done, and the All-Star voice acting cast is much more of a draw for me than I anticipted. Combined, this made the diplomacy/narritive more engaging than typical games. With that said, this is the RARE strategy game that has a half-decent diplomacy system! Negociations are in general what one can expect, but I wish they would use my captured spies as bargining chips rather than just kill them. On that note, the spycraft for the game is somewhat basic, but still functional enough to make it a valid component of the game, but spycraft is a hard fit for this genra to balance out appropriately.  The combat system is one of the best parts of the game I find. I love the aspect that you can have a hybrid system where the AI takes over the multitasking functions while you can focus on a single task (or stack tasks via pause function). The combat visualizations are somewhat generic, but the gameplay itself is very solid. I find myself confident in my ability to command, but there is always still that edge of if I developed my fleet for the right task (where as some games its so imbalanced you can spam 1-2 units and call it a day).  Lastly, for those who are running a less than top-teir computers, this game is more lightweight (at least from my perspective) than other high-CPU demanding games.  All in all, this is a very good buy for the sci-fi gamer or the TBS type gamer. A must have for those who love both."
298110,Far Cry 4,"The main character AJ is usless as sh*t. Takes for ever to do anything. The story line is horrible. What kind of ending or even boss fight was that? The tank on left 4 dead has more drama than this sh*t. the stealth system is sh*t, they will magically see you a mile away. The guns are weak as f*ck. You'll get used to unloading a clip per person. This whole game is sh*t. I should have waited until it was $20. Then it may have been worth it."
298140,Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches,"Recommend but at discount only, about 5-8 hours of gameplay, great storytelling, annoying puzzles  There are lots of items to interact with in the game world, and the game will only allow you to put into your inventory items that you can use immediately. I recommend every time you find something that you make a note of what it is and where it is located, since it's very likely you'll need it for some future puzzle. Sometimes what the game considers 'usable right away' might be different than your logic. The map feature allows you to jump between key locations, but sometimes it seems like you need to move to a certian area to trigger an event in the game. So if you are stuck somewhere trying to pick up an object that it looks like you need right now, try walking (not jumping) to a different location.  It seems like the more non-intuitive puzzles are right at the beginning, which is too bad. This is the sort of game that I can see people getting stuck on and giving up on early. The storytelling is excellent, and even if the interface is showing its age it still is a good game.  Good: + Good story-driven point and click game that is tied into Welsh legends with great ambient music. + Decent length, if you can get over the negatives it can be a very good value for the price  Neutral: . Graphics are from the FHD era (I first played this in 2008) but this doesn't affect too much . Contains some music puzzles . Has a mapping feature for external locations . Has a notebook to prompt you what puzzles to solve to progress the story  Negative: - Some puzzles are maddeningly non-intuitive (it helps to have the Gameboomers walkthrough bookmarked) - Some locations have the 'invisible wall' effect, or 'why can't I move right *there*?'   Even for the cheap price, I can only recommend this on discount unless you are a strong fan of Welsh lore or other games of the 'U.K. horror' genre (i.e. Lost Crown, Darkfall, Barrow Hill). I got it 80% off ($1 and change) which was plenty good for this game."
298160,Eldevin,"I had an itch for an oldschool RPG, and now I have found one. If you are looking for a game that is simple yet complete and well done, this is the game for you. The graphics aren't amazing, but it will run on almost any machine and have a sort of nostalgia to it that is very pleasant. Just try it, afterall it is free!"
298180,The Desolate Hope,It's a great game. Being a game from the early stages of Scott Cawthon. I just love it
298220,Terraformer Expedition to Mars,Update as of 9/22/2016 game is all but abandonded my the devs no info or update in over a year game is dead and broken dont buy i repeat do not buy game is unstable and all but broken.
298240,War Trigger 3,Hahah it is a fun game. I played it like 4 years ago and i was like lvl 28. So ye now im kinda playing it again.
298260,Only If,"Normally a huge indie game fan but really can't recommend this one. Lack of controls adjustment leaves the player motion sick, no subtitles makes it hard to understand what is being said, confusing and very unintuitive puzzles. Struggled to get immersed into the story or motivated to complete. Some good ideas here and hopeful to see future titles as developer grows."
298280,XenoRaptor, Early Access Review
298340,Flashout 2,This game is fun the AI is actually a little bit challenging which means you dont get to bored. I bought it on sale and id probs buy it off sale now knowing what the games like also to all the people complaining about how it doesnt have full controller support if you go into ur settings and click controller instead of the keyboard it works so maybe just check that next time you think of giving a game a bad review because of that this game is amazing and i plan to get many hours out of this i normally dont even write reviews :D Moral of this is buy this game !!!
298360,Immortal Defense,Wut? Wuuut? What do i do in this game?
298400,Knightmare Tower,"Well, actually I like the game a lot, but something very frustrating have happened. Every time i close the game all the progress is reseted...... I'm using linux, and i won't recommend the game until this problem is fixed."
298420,Dreii,local only multiplayer. stop trying to bring back couch gaming.
298480,Victory At Sea,"I played early version of the game to try it and really loved that little fun game than decided to purchase it.   BUT the game is not fun (not even a little bit) anymore.  AI (friend or foe) always try to sink my ship instead of other AI ships, and even worse, friendly AI ships always try to sink my ship with torpedoes. AI enemy ships are so accurate and they never give you a chance to survive. I lost my ship ~20 times every battle (till quit the game) just after tutorial missions. This is not the game I played before. I played Normal (easiest available) mode but it is so hard and not fun any more. I don't even want to think about harder game modes.  You, devs, what do you want to do to this fun game? Who constrain you to change game mechanics and difficulty, just give me a name and watch the firework."
298520,Orbital Gear,"Controls. Example: Im running around a planet or whatever it is, holding the S key and so i want to jump to another planet so i jump and press shift for my boost thing but then becaue im still holding S im pulled back on to the planet i started on. And there are a lot more examples you can find for yourself"
298560,Captain Forever Remix, Early Access Review
298630,The Escapists,"I thought this game was great before I got it, and now it's even better that I have it!  So happy with the pixelated design, and the amazing guard/jailbird physics! Love it, with a little cherry on top!  This one deserves... Wait for it... Here it comes... ULTIMATE GR8 R8 8/8 MOI8  What? Ultimate BOOM is Captain Flynn's thing!"
298790,Rock Boshers DX: Director's Cut,"Inspired by the system (ZX Spectrum) which made me fall in love with videogames, I can almost taste my Creamola Foam fueled days passed. It plays like the early games from that system, a wee bit like 'treasure island'. Whether you'll dig it comes down to the level of nostalgic you have for these kind of games. Personally the developer Tikipod Ltd can't do wrong with me, he/she isn't paying me to say this either. I just really enjoy playing Tikipods games e.g. Aqua Kitty. Now I wonder if I can plant the seed of them doing a 'Dizzy' game for us that no longer have a speccy.    10/10 would enjoy a tape loader again"
298820,Millennium 2 - Take Me Higher,i recently bought a game from aldorlea games from they website and the game dont work and since is not made by adorlea...they dont give a fook if some1 selling games in they website rippes u off... SO STAY AWAY FROM ALDORLEA GAME SITE buy them here on steam where u know ur money will be refunded
298830,Millennium 3 - Cry Wolf,"Aside from some decent charater portraits, the game feels like an average RPG Maker affair. Through the time I played, battles tended to be either really easy or absurdly difficult. One particularily nasty forced encounter involved fighting multiple enemies that could remove party members with ease. There very well may be something to offer in this game, but I didn't find myself wanting to push through anymore to find out."
298840,Millennium 4 - Beyond Sunset,"Millenium is an amazing game series, this is the first RPG I ever played on Steam and I haven't yet found anything that beats it. Millenium will always be my favouite I couldn't recommend it any more highly."
298850,Millennium 5 - The Battle of the Millennium,"I would recommend this game for the patient. It's long and tedious and the end, for me, was frustrating. It depends on personality, I guess."
298900,Space Hulk: Deathwing,"I love 40k, total 40k fan boy but i can not reccomend this game...iam running the game on ultra settings, with a GTX 980 and the graphics look like pooo. nothing like the screen shots show on the steam store. just poooo"
298930,Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder,"I really wanted to play this game but couldn't! Every two minutes the game would crash so I gave up, glad I bought it when it was on sale."
298950,Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage Director's Cut Edition,worst game ever. dont buy this game
2990,FlatOut 2,"Its Like Next Car Game, But Optimised and Finished."
29900,Dark Sector,Very nice game
299030,Blood: One Unit Whole Blood,This game needs to get ported properly. The default mouse aiming is absolutly horrible Its like all of your characters weapons have weights attatched to the tip of them. This problem and many more could easily get fixed with the help of Duke Megaton and Shadow Warrior Classic Reduxs engine overhaul and Blood can easily take off to being the greatest classic FPS game of all time.  But for now its a great game with a crappy run down port.
299050,Blood II: The Chosen + Expansion,first game i had to buy a new pc.
299070,Warrior Kings: Battles,"Fantastic strategy game. I love how you get resources, sacrificing peasants is fun. There is strategy in placing raids in the game, attacking carts for example can cripple your opponent his economy.  The factions are very interesting. You do not choose which faction you want to play at the beginning you do so by building certain buildings that branch in other paths.  EG: Building a maypole makes you a pagan so you can not build the altar or something but the moonpool building is now available and so forth."
299090,Cosplay Maker,"Oh my god,this game is terrible, the art work is awful, the design of the clothes are bulky and slobby. The upbeat jazzy music as good as it is doesn't fit with the game at all! i played like 5 min and i can't stand it anymore...."
299100,Back To Life 2,Pros:  Cons:  - No tutorial  - No volume control.  - No story / stupid story?  TraSH  #TrashORTreasure  
299110,Theatre Of The Absurd,"This was a weird game, but it was certainly different from other HOG I've played. It was pretty, the sound and music were good without being distracting and the storywas unique. Unfortunately the bons content/level is a serious let down. It was short and pointless."
299150,Empress Of The Deep,I highly enjoyed this game and the visuals. The graphics were good with good games. The story was pretty good.
299160,Empress Of The Deep 2: Song Of The Blue Whale,"I expected this game to be better than the first one, not worse! Stupid uninventive story, boring and extremely repetitive game actions, repetitive minigames, bad graphics quality, confusing hidden-object scenes (usually solvable just by random clicking) and completely useless map that's even worse than in the first game. And as a bonus you have to listen to the villainess' demented laughter every minute or so. Also there is a hidden match-3 minigame that's absolutely not worth unlocking. Highly NOT recommended."
299170,Vault Cracker,"Decent little game. Nothing really amazing, but what it did, it did well. Good HOG with well drawn environments. The voice acting was a nice surprise and pacing was handled well. Short but organized, each story piece was fleshed out and logical. Overall an easy 3 hours blown and considering it goes on sale fairly often it's a worthwhile grab for fans of the genre. As a sidenote I liked the chapter interludes where you got to choose the player character's gear and look, nice addition into the HOG framework. Very cool."
299180,Millionaire Manor,"I encountered a lot of glitches (items remaining on screen, desynced audio, some puzzles not working), and the game doesn't really have a story either. Maybe if they remastered it it would be fun, but it's sadly outdated."
299260,Commando Jack,"This is a fairly bland tower defense like any other tower defense. You can go into first-person mode and shoot some aliens yourself, but the core gameplay is still pretty familiar. So what it really comes down to is execution. And, well...it's a mobile port. It's VERY CONSPICUOUSLY a mobile port. The interface is clearly designed for a touch screen. There are no keyboard shortcuts and no way to change the controls. It runs in a fixed fullscreen resolution, so if you want to go into windowed mode or adjust it to fit your monitor better...sorry, there's no option for that.  To top it all off, it's priced at $10, which is quite frankly an unreasonable price point for a port so lacking in polish. There are tower defense games out there that are just as good or better that you can play totally free.  Look, I like the tower defense genre, but you can do a lot better than this game. Do not recommend."
299340,Habitat,Start game Do tutorial Start campaign Follow mission text Get immediately destroyed because didn't build up habitat before following mission text Restart campaign Spend an hour building up nice combat ready habitat Follow mission text to trigger combat Get immediately destroyed by the unexpected npc habitat detonation Quit game

299420,CubeGun, Early Access Review
299440,Rooks Keep,"  DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine"
299480,Rogue Stormers,Was a lot more fun when it was based on weapon customization.
299500,International Snooker,"if your after a pretty relaxing game to pass the time or fun with a friend i would definitely recommend this, the graphics are amazing and the game play is simple enough to understand within a minute of starting, would recommend getting it on sale though."
299540,Heroes Rise: The Prodigy,"Ok game but kinda short, need to buy the sequel if you want to further the storyline. There are better games in the Choice of series."
299600,Dragon Fin Soup,"I Kickstartered this game, and for the time that it worked, despite the rough edges in the first releases, it was fun.  Before really digging in, I decided to wait for some of the big patches to come out, but by then I was busy with life and had to put the game on hold.  Fast forward, I upgraded to Windows 10, and now the game no longer will start at all. I deleted all the files and re-installed, read forum threads, and tried everyhing recommended. In the end I got nowhere.  But here is the kicker: The devs seem to have disappeared off the face of the Earth. No patches in nearly a year, and no word on the upcoming big content update in almost as long.  At this point, it certainly looks like abandonware."
299660,6180 the moon,I liked the mind bending puzzle/jumping game. Its a bit short but it probably is better that way. Because it might get boring.
299680,Tengami,"This isn't so much a thumbs down as a 'meh', but if you like what you see in the trailer, and the music, and just the relaxed 'feel' of the environment you might like this game. Visually it looks great and the folding nature of the world is unique. The puzzles were sortof OK, but I gotta admit I lost interest before reaching the end. I recently just finished it because it had been sitting unfinished for many months and ... you know how it is, sometimes you just want to finish something.   Would I recommend it, though? No. Only if this strongly appeals to you. "
299720,Terrorhedron,good game single player but just so you know before you buy it multiplayer require port-fowarding wich might be complicated soo if you plan play with family and dont know how to port foward might wanna pass on this one  otherwise its good game
299740,Miscreated, Early Access Review
299780,Noir Syndrome,'You have stolen from the mob' *Gets shot before finishing reading* $!@#$%
299800,The Land of Eyas,"The Land of Eyas is a great platformer with an interesting mechanic, The art style and all round polish of the game is amazing. I fully recommend this game to anyone!"
299840,Metal Planet,This is a multiplayer only game that nobody plays. How could I even tell if it was worth playing if there is nobody to play it with and no single player option?
299910,Forgotten Myths CCG,"Recently, the developers admitted that they can no longer support the costs of Forgotten Myths.  'Nevertheless, there is a solid game design in FM, with a wide range of features, and a lot more to come. It has massive potential, and we know that many people who play the game actually think it's better than most of its competitors, but the lack of activity or sloppy implementation kills the fun.  All it needs is proper implementation and marketing (which I can't do on my own and without any funds). So, if anyone is interested in purchasing FM and keeping it alive or nurturing it, I am more than happy to do that and see it live rather than see it dead. Moreover, I am more than willing to continue working on FM, if the new owners can compensate me or pay me'  This are the words of the designer and developer of Forgotten Myths CCG. I am part of the community and i don't want to let this game die. I personally think it has potential and it would be a great source of income, if good invested.

30,Day of Defeat,"A Good FPS Multiplayer game to buy at less than 5$. The game is still alive with lots of servers and players at 2017. If you are looking to buy a game to just activate your account, Then I suggest you to buy this game."
300,Day of Defeat: Source,Great game
3000,GTI Racing,"Basically a crappy Volkswagon advertisement. It sat on the shelf at a Gamestop until corporate dropped the price to a penny which meant it was supposed to be thrown away. It's not even worth that one penny. The graphics aren't that awful but absolutely everything else is uninspired, buggy, and lacking. Play Gran Turismo instead."
300060,ADR1FT,This feels like a tech demo for VR. The whole game seems to consist of you tapping W and holding F. Occasionally they feed you some story through audio logs. I can't bring myself to finish this even though I imagine it's pretty short.
300080,Total War Battles: KINGDOM,"I've gotten to a point where it's just a castle builder sim. You only get limited unique troops. Ranged combat is manual as well as timer delay when commanding multi troops. Computer is typical 'controls / react instantly' which detours most TBS games. Eventually you get pitted against Tier 3 mobs, which make it nearly impossible as it takes literally several days to upgrade 1 troop gear stat when crafting, and the xp is very low to increase troop levels / tiers.  Controls are a bit awkward. Having to click so many times for resources is painful. Click building .. click harvest 1 or 2 sources .. wait 5 mins .. only speed up is a hold click on building w/ auto collect but none the less painful slow collection. There isn't enough to do to keep you playing more than 10 mins at a time, even then its usually waiting for a 2nd resource to complete.  I typically to 'harvest all' which greatly reduces your output and takes 1 hour. But is much less of a hassle."
300220,Victim of Xen,It's a decent RPG as far as RPGmaker games go. It can be made real easy to beat though if you know where to get infinite money to buy the best gear.
300260,Planetoid Pioneers, Early Access Review
300280,Adventurezator: When Pigs Fly,"I guess this game is no longer being developed? Makes me sad as this was one of the indie games in my library that really caught my eye. It's a really well made game, no bugs, story is easy to follow and the game mechanics work really well together so you can experiment without fear.  Plays like a point and click puzzle game with excellent balanced difficulty but I looked around and there's no walkthroughs for it so I guess if you get stuck you really get stuck ha.. Adventurezator has a bunch of fairy tale characters which I have a soft spot for, and a lot of creativity running through its data veins which is great.   For me, the bad things are: lots of swearing in the dialogue, and the underlining sadness I experience when I remember development stopped v-v  Overall I really enjoy playing, like it's a lot of fun, so much that it's becoming one of my favourite genres."
300300,Ichi,"Rating: 4/10   Pros:  - Easy to learn/play. - Many hours of play. - Create your own levels is fun.   Cons:  - Changing the settings (sound, screen resolution) isn't intuitive. - Too many rubbish levels created by users. - So so many bugs."
300320,The Few,"This is not a historically based game. It is arcadish. It is repetitive, and at times tedious. The AI has some gimmicky aspects to it. It is only worth buying if the price stays as low as it is now. For under $10 USD it will give you a few hours of game play but probably not more than that.   I do not recommend this game."

300360,Evil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween,"I bought this game for Halloween, hoping to enjoy a nice casual puzzle game with a Halloween theme, instead I got a game that is so illogical that it was nothing more than a chore to finish. The story (if that's what you want to call it) makes no sense whatsoever, it's like the guy who wrote it was on some kind of hallucination trip. Unfortunately, what's even worse than the story are the 'puzzles' themselves. Nothing makes sense, all you do is keep clicking all over the screen, hoping that you might get lucky to find what item interacts with another item. Normally, though, you just end up waiting for the hint bar to reset, and use that instead. Even after finding the right combinations, they just don't make any sense whatsoever. I'm stubborn, so I finished the game, but I really wish I had saved myself a lot of time and aggravation, and just stopped playing after the first few minutes."

300400,Unpossible,"Lots of good things in this game, but those don't matter. I dislike having to learn the course by heart because it's the only way to be able to win, so i cannot recommend it."
300510,Them - The Summoning,"I hate to add to the negative reviews, but this game is just not worth it. The little story is ok, but not really resolved as this was supposed to be part 1 of 3. But the biggest issue is with the resolution - it can't be changed, so all the hidden object scenes are super frustrating as all the items are blurry and weird. There is also no direction in some scenes, which can lead to a lot of frustration unless you use the hint button. You'll also get angry when you are trying to find something generic like 'paper' and the room is filled with.....papers. All in all, pass this one up."
300540,Sweet Lily Dreams,"Whew. Just finished it. This game gets an 8 out of 10. Maybe a 7.5, as 15€ is imho too pricey for what it is. I would personally price it closer to 7-10€ instead.  - Should I buy this? (aka the Short Review) This game is made in RPG maker, so you need to like that style of gameplay (Ib, Corpse Party, Mihao... without the horror), with final-fantasy-turn-based kind of battles. There are card drops, but to get all the achievements you need to complete the game twice. Playtime to complete the game once was 17 hours for me, which is very good. The story is well told and the mechanics are enjoyable. It's not a horror game, but it has 2 or 3 scary/dark moments.  You play as Lily, accompanied by a party of 3 as you travel to several dream worlds, each inspired by a different real life book. I loved the various references, such as the Kingdom Hearts intro, and the end lets open the possibilities for a sequel. NOTE: I played this, abandoned it, and picked it up much later. I learned that the game gets MUCH more enjoable after the first world (aka once your party is formed and you start travelling trough dream worlds). Keep an open mind.  - The art is awesome. Not necessarily what you would expect from an AA game, but considering the RPG maker kit this is truly wonderful. The developer mentioned that they tried to stay away from the kit as much as they could, and it really shows. It's unique, nice to look at, and makes you see that they really put thought into it. - The story is also really nice. At some point I started believing they were 'telegraphing' the ending twist, but that did not happen (not that I would have minded). It does a good job of making you feel involved and care for the characters. After the end, a little scene shows a cliffhanger, but it doesn't ruin the story. - Gameplay is fun. I usually dislike turn based battles, but in this game I had lots of fun all round. There is a little bit of crafting, and some customizing (Lily can wear one of four outfits), which I think are a nice touch. There are puzzles, so be prepared to scratch your head a bit!  This is why I took out 2 points for my review: - You HAVE TO complete the game twice, to get all the achievements. This is a big no-no for me. I am NOT going to enjoy being forced through the entire game.  - Missable achievement: you need to collect all the game coins to get this one. There are one or two places that become unavailable as you go along, and again you will need to replay the entire game to achieve it.  Overall I RECOMMEND the game based on its great playability, nice story and pretty art style. I would not recommend it to completionists, unless they are prepared to go trough it twice and consume a lot of time."
300550,Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut,"Expansion to Shadowrun Returns, this Directors Cut version seems to improve a bit on UI and mechanics, but as I couldn't finish the first game I'm not playing this. Get it if you liked the first one."
300570,Infinifactory, Early Access Review
300580,GALAK-Z,"I do recommend Galak-Z, but it is brutally difficult.  Positives:  The art and snippets of story are good, and the characters and enemies say some fun lines (though there's a limited number, so you Will rehear them multiple times)  It is satisfying to pilot your ship/mech: Throwing asteroids into groups of enemies, and filling tight corridors with your laser and missile fire. It is also fun to find upgrades for your ship and collect salvage to buy more.  The core gameplay is great, but the larger systems surrounding it can be frustrating.  Negatives:  To make the game more 'rogue-like', dying means losing all progress on the current level, including all the money and upgrades you collected. Losing progress is never fun, but death can sometimes feel unfair when a while into the game, sword-wielding mechs appear that can easily just shrug off your damage and chase you down for the kill. Spending so long and getting so close to the end of a mission just to die and be forced to restart several times can be really irritating.  The tough penalty for defeat wouldn't be so bad if the game was wholeheartedly training players to improve their gunplay and mobility in combat, but instead it almost always provides a much faster and easier way out. Rather than overcome tough encounters the game usually encourages players to just find and exploit 'cheese' tactics to get through. When blind shooting from off-screen, running  ridiculously  far away spamming shots at whatever is following, or just skipping a tough encounter entirely, is rewarded so much more than overcoming it the traditional way, players dig a hole for themselves later when they can't skip a fight and they get abused by the hefty defeat penalty.  The progression system is another controversial topic. Upgrading your ship is crucial to the game, but after every set of ~5 levels the story will continue but all of your upgrades are taken away. The progression system feels a lot less deep when half the time you're just re-earning the upgrades you had not long ago. (At first I was really annoyed, but after playing Galak-Z over many separate playsessions this stopped being a big deal, I just worried about my current set of upgrades and getting more, not dwelling on what I had lost)  The last critique I have from my experience with Galak-Z is its underdeveloped (or at least under-explained) stealth system. You can see the 'field of vision' cones for nearby enemies, and a glowing aura around your ship to represent the distance away you can be detected. Yet I still didn’t feel like stealth was a very viable option. Enemies seemed to notice me randomly on occasion, and most mission finale areas aren't large enough to provide stealthy options. I'd also love to see some ship upgrades related to stealth, but I don't think there are any.  Overall:  Galak-Z has a lot of room for improvement, but it is still a very fun spaceship shooting, action game. The exploration and upgrading is fun, the combat is intense (because you really don't want to die  again  haha.) And if you have patience and like skillful games, Galak-Z can be very satisfying."
300610,Pure Pool,"I would recommend this if it worked properly. It doesn't so I can't. Lovely looking game with great atmosphere. Two games of snooker played so far, both unfinishable due to software bugs. First game I got stuck as the game thought that the brown was on the table when it wasn't so both players could either foul by hitting 'the wrong colour' or give up. I gave up. Second game, the yellow would not display properly and when trying to hit it, the cue ball would not move correctly. Issues with the physics after this point. Gave up.  Please fix this game as you are being paid good money for a faulty product. The longer you leave it the more your score will go down on Steam and people will revert to your competitors and accuse you of ripping them off, as you say you will look at issues but it's not happening.  A real shame as it's a nicer game than Pool Nation FX. Please fix it or give me my money back."
300620,Flyhunter Origins,Cute little game that's fun to play and has a Ratchet and Clank/Jak and Daxter feel to the cutscenes. There's also a lot of whimsical humor and charm. It's obvious some talented artists came together for this.
300630,Pure Chess,"The game is exactly what it's title promises. It's just about chess. In my opinion, I am a bad-low average chess player. So for me, the KI is fine. I'm actually stuck on rank 3, so there are 7 left. As soon as I do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the game punishes me. And of course sometimes the KI does dumb things, too.  Whats left to say? You can save your game up to 6 different save games. If you are a core chess gamer, then the KI may be not challenging. If you are a bad causal chess player like me, then the KI will stomp you if you wish.  It's just a good chess game."

300820,Toy Story 3,It's a great game without the graphics and bugs and glitches and the fact you have to download a patch for it to work
300840,JUJU,"Great family game. Played through it with a 4 year old who absolutely loved it. The best part was the second player doesn't die, so long as the first player stays alive (or vice-versa), so the 4 year old was able to fully enjoy the game without the threat of dying.  I definitely recommend this game, especially for parents &amp; children to play together, or anyone looking for a quick game to play through on their off time.   Also want to note the adorable graphics and worlds. Very creative, colorful, and might I say, cute."
300900,Hippocampal: The White Sofa,"  I can't reccomend you BUY this product as I got it as a gift from a friend.  That aside, if you enjoy really short, REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed up games, buy away!  Making no sense but being sufficiently entertaining for the duration of play it is definitely worth a quick play, but not a quick buy."
300910,Monster Challenge Circus,What I did wrong to deserve this as a gift I'll never know.
300970,Fiesta Online NA,"I agree with the review that said that the only people who still play this are really casual players that don't give a crap about 'omg best evur' stuff, or older players who have sunk too much time and money into it to let go. I used to play this game a lot, then I left for a while and everything seemed horrible when I came back and it was horrible. VERY play-to-win, very party-reliant; its a good mmo to start out with but when you realize its really crappy, its probably time to move on to bigger and better things."
3010,Xpand Rally,"It's pretty decent for a Rally game, only problem is no licensing so all cars have weird names and mostly look the same, i picked it up in the Summer Sale for 79p so i recommend."
301050,Night Shift,This game has a wonderful atmosphere and soundtrack. I wouldn't say that I totally understand the puzzles but feel like I'm making progress. I'm enjoying exploring and experimenting.
301120,Eastside Hockey Manager,The game has been stuck on Aug 9th 2021 for about 2 weeks now. It crashes eveytime you try to pass it. IOOTP has known about this game issue and yet no fixes. Try to start a new game and same thing crashes eveytime.  Unplayable atm 
301150,The Treasures of Montezuma 4,"It has very complex visuals with quite bad animations. Sometimes you feel like the game is just winning for you as, even if you make a bad choice, the falling pieces will create a series of bonus. It constantly tries to give you hints, which is annoying and I'm not sure if it can be turned off. Even though I liked the iPad version of this game some years ago, I can not recommend this game for PC."
301190,Frederic: Resurrection of Music,"The controls might be a little sluggish with a keyboard, but this one of those good-natured Action Rhythm games! &lt;3  Totally loved this simple game... Did I mention the soundtracks are awesome!  Score :  &gt; Gameplay 4/5  &gt; Fun 5/5 &gt; Content Value 5/5"
301200,Frederic: Evil Strikes Back,"Want a sequel that have it's own take on 'Pop Culture References' ? The first game was great! But this one is definetly better. Even though, the controls still stiffed.. Good soundtracks, good artstyles, and finally using the game engine to render the cutscenes in 60fps!  The learning curves really wants you to get all of those 'Perfect' notes (IMPOSSIBRU!) And i found the achievements are riddiculously amusing~ Recommended game!

It also makes me remember years ago playing it, so it on steam made me happy. It's really funny, good gameplay and thank goodness for unlocks. It's hardly changes gameplay (like tf2 hats) but it's something. Overall, one of my favorite games."
301320,NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation,"i thought it would be easy to use, with a polished interface, but its very technical. Get it if you arent like me and have enough brain power and an attention span at least 5 hours."
301360,Kill Fun Yeah,    I got this game for free. Thanks Gameminer!
301380,Date Warp,"While it's a short game, the story and the final ending make it worth every cent. The emotions and the different plots through the multiple endings are all wrapped up smoothly to make a fantastic and lasting impression of the game. While it may be a bit grinding to get to the final end, it is definitely worth the time!"
301420,Third Eye Crime,"For what appears to be a phone port, this game is pretty fun. Controlls are not the best on a computer mouse but they are manageable. The idea itself is good, and for a touch screen this game would be tops. Grab it on a sale or pick it up from tremor cheap!"
301460,Electronic Super Joy: Groove City,"I want to start by saying that I loved the first game. ESJ was, and remains, one of the tightest platformers I've ever played, and challenging enough that I'm still going back to work on the bonus levels. That said... what happened?  This game is frustratingly short, and can only claim difficulty on par with the first game by the metric of dying in the same place a bunch. Most of this game is a breeze compared to even the earliest of ESJ levels, but you'll still die because this game is so floaty. The slam mechanic in the first game kept platforming quick and skillful, allowing you to get back to the action faster by trading speed for time to line up jumps. You were likely to die, sure, but if you didn't, you had precious seconds that weren't wasted falling. Now, there is no slam, and every drop feels too long. The other powerups seem to have disappeared, and the level mechanics of old are practically unused. A handful of sticky walls, a couple of irritatingly placed max-length jumps... nothing like some of the platforming challenges of ESJ.   Of course, the game needs to feel long, because as I said, it's frustratingly short. 100% completion clocked me at 77 minutes, and that's mostly the time I spent trying to get Black Stars before I realized that they count whether you live or die. The rainbow stars are interesting, but ultimately pointless as well. Meanwhile, I have 13 hours and counting in ESJ, and I'm nowhere near 100%, just on the overall time achievements alone, much less beating the bonus levels.   The music is the saving grace, as good as ever. But honestly? If you played ESJ and want more, you're better off replaying the first game and maybe just layering this soundtrack over the top to make it feel slightly different. This game doesn't do enough to stand out as a sequel, and could have been an added levelpack to the first."
301500,BOMB,"I am sorry that I cannot recommend this game. ALthough some people seem to be able to play OK, I was plagued with controller issues.  I tried with both a joystick (Sidewinder FF2) and a gamepad (xbox 360). After several tries I was finally able to bind the pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust axes to the joystick, but I was still not able to control the plane. For instance, sometimes it would start out OK, but then it would start to dive and pulling the stick all the way back would only level the plane but it wold not climb.   Afer a half hour of this frustration I gave up and requested a refund. I liked the concept of the game and had looked forward to getting it for a couple of years, so I was disapponted that I nver got it to work."
301520,Robocraft, Early Access Review
301540,Rhythm Destruction,"What could have been a good idea fails on execution. Terrible music to which what you do doesnt seem to have a whole lot of relevance despite being a ryhthm game, coupled with a complete lack of player feedback, since nothing makes any noise besides you boosting. Most rhythm games include a sound when you press buttons because it helps you audibly recognize how on beat you are, it needs a shot sound or enemy ship death sound instead of everything being in silence. The button presses are too infrequent to really feel as if you are matching the rhythm and even trying to keep track of what buttons to press whilst you are also trying to dodge enemy fire means you need to be looking everywhere all the time, which is horrible.  There are better Rhythm games. There are better Shmups. Aint much reason to play this once you realize the novelty just covers up a uninteresting mush."
301560,White Night,"This game... I don't know what to say other than IT'S UNDERRATED AS HECK!!! I was shocked of the low rating and user review percentage when I first got the game but wow they did not discourage me from buying! This game had a very unique feel and it is for sure a game I will REMEMBER in the future. From all the great scares to the tough, but solvable puzzles and the beautiful artstyle this game will be forever in the back of your head as one to never forget. IT DOES HOWEVER, suffer from stiff controls aswell as only a FEW weird camera angles that sometimes can harm the player more than offer a great view. Other than that, sit back, get yourself in a dark, quiet room, and enjoy the ride and thrill this game gives. TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME 100% FOR THE HORROR AND PUZZLE LOVING PLAYER!"
301610,OpenCanvas 6,"OpenCanvas is a wonderful piece of software, it really is. The development staff was helpful when I requested help, also. It is good software.

301740,Castle: Never Judge a Book by its Cover,"As a huge fan of the TV show and knowing about this being a hidden objects game, I had high hopes.   Yet, I feel underwhelmed.   Its biggest flaw is the presentation. No music from the show's extensive score? At least they got the likenesses and the writing down, even if it's without voice work.   The riddles are ok, but the actual hidden object parts lack of variety. You'll quickly see how many items repeat themselves over the course of the game.   Get it at a discount. It's just way too short with a single case stretching over five chapters."

301830,Disney-Pixar Brave,"I bough this game for my little sister, and instead I am the one having fun with it."
301860,Submerged,"I really like this game. It is a nice zero-stress exploration platformer that tells an interesting story and has beautiful artwork. I say zero-stress because there's no way to 'die' in the game. You can't fall off any platforms, and there's no monsters or sea creatures to fight (there are creatures, but you don't fight them). If that's what you're looking for, then this game's for you!  The main focus is on exploration and scaling buildings to find 'clues' that unravel the story. Zipping around in the boat and seeing all the various buildings &amp; landmarks is fun. The pictograph cluse are also a neat idea. I finished the 'main quest' (so to speak) in 4 hours ... but I have more clues to collect to find out the city's story.  I'm glad I bought it."
301910,Saints Row: Gat out of Hell,"Loved the hell theme and weapons, but the game is just way too short to be a Saints Row game."
301920,War of the Human Tanks - ALTeR,"Truthully speaking, I was looking forward to this game after the great impression the first one left with me. But I can honestly say that I am not having fun with this. The gameplay lays out the same way as it's predessecor, except this time there are a few new tanks, which is always nice. The story isn't really relevant, let's be honest with ourselves, these games have no story.   The biggest flaw with this installment is the cavern system. The cavern is a very long series of challenges that make up pretty much most of this game, as you progress, the battles become very hard very quickly. I found myself being unable to clear floor 9, either because my troops died or I ran out of time.   The problem is grinding, in the end. You need to grind to get resources, which you use to buy better tanks to make battles easier on yourself. But the thing is that the best tanks, or even the slightly better tanks are very expensive, and the free battles that are actually possible for me hand out a ♥♥♥♥ poor amount of resources.   Most of your finances will come from the cavern, and I am stuck in a loop hole where I end up 'not being able to progress through the cavern because I don't have good enough tanks, but I can't get better tanks because I don't have the money, and I can only really get money from the cavern, but I can't progress through the cavern...' and so on and so forth.  So, I can't reccomend this game, it doesn't hold the same spark the first did, with the resource management and obtainment being clunkier than before. And the story really faltered and made me feel as if everything I achieved before hand meant nothing. I give it a 6/10, and can only hope that the next one isn't so mildly dissapointing."
301930,War of the Human Tanks - Limited Operations,"It's a decent turn based strategy game, but it's very flawed and could use a real face lift and a better story flow. The wall of text and lack of illustrations makes the text wall a real chore.   http://gamers-haven.org/war-of-the-human-tanks/ "

302080,Bus Driver,frames were to glitchy and the reaction was to slow in the control.  if you want a bus simulator game bus simulator 2k16 is better
302110,Small Town Terrors Pilgrim's Hook Collector's Edition,"I like this game because it is not overly hard, but hard enough to be worth doing."
302120,House of 1000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster Collector's Edition,"I enjoyed this sequel to 'House of 1000 Doors Family Secrets' but I do have some minor gripes with the game. First, I find 'Family Secrets' to be the superior title and suggest playing that game first.* House of 1000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster is pretty much the same exact game as Family Secrets, but easier in my opinion. Some of the puzzles just seems to pad out its shorter length and some just seem uninspired. My biggest gripe with Plam of Zoroaster is that they used the same music and some of the same exact models and drawings from Family Secrets! I enjoyed the music and the artwork, but you really couldn't have added some new tracks and lessened the amount of reused artwork? Overall, if you liked family secrets then you won't really go wrong with Palm of Zoroaster, but expect a very simliar experience that doesn't feel as satisfying. I suggest getting it on sale like I did.    (It's also comes before Zoroaster. I guess there are three games in the series, but I've only played 2 &amp; 3)"
302130,Brink of Consciousness: Dorian Gray Syndrome,"Wow! This game had the perfect amount of creepiness. I liked the fact that you really had to search like it was real life. As if you were truly locked in a house with a creepy serial killer. The mini-games were fun and challenging and the hidden object scenes were interactive. The voice overs were well done and the music was perfect. I will say, if you are looking for an easy HO adventure, this one is probably not it."
302160,The Egyptian Prophecy: The Fate of Ramses,Game wouldn't load. GTFO
302170,The Cameron Files: The Secret at Loch Ness,Wasting money to buy this one. unbalance price and quality
302180,Voyage: Journey to the Moon,"Still a very nice first person adventure game.  I played this game when it came out and really enjoyed it, like most of the Microïds adventure games of its time.  The story is told in a simple but fun way and it really grips you because there is a lot to discover. I especially like the many things you can do with the fruit.  It is quite challenging at times, but never too difficult or too easy. Even the second time playing it ten years later I had forgotten a lot of details and had a lot of fun reliving the experience and puzzles.  Today it looks a bit more dated offcourse, but for yhe genre that is no problem at all and you soon forget about resolutions when you are playing.  Give it a chance and you will love it."
302190,Amerzone: The Explorer's Legacy,"Beautiful point and click adventure game designed by Benoît Sokal (Syberia series, Sinking Island, Paradise etc.) with good puzzles, which is reminiscened of Myst but (in my opinion) with a much more interesting story line."
302210,Curse: The Eye of Isis,Stupid game.....controls suck could'nt even figure out how to protect myself while getting attack. ugg
302260,Truffle Saga,Best game I have EVER PLAYED. EVER. Seriously. So amazing.  10/10 - Flawless  (really though don't buy it)
302270,Dungeon Defenders Eternity,"Honestly, lost interest in this game when they broke it with a total 're balance'. The original was much better; should have just sorted out the issues with high level gear not generating correctly and solved the item hacking problem instead of trying to make the same game all over again. . ."
302290,Infinite Game Works Episode 0,"Good game but quickly became repetetive. Very easy to finish a game in a quarter of the time, very easy to reach any monitary goals.  Have some conversations but the gameplay is so repetetive that even playing thru the game once was on the edge of 'too much'.  Still goto recomend the game though, it atleast earned that."
302320,Storm over the Pacific,Sadly i must say i dont understand this game at all.  Loosing every battle without understanding really why. Cant say that is enjoyable. I have tried to give the game several chanses but sadly no. GFx is ok but the interface feels clumpsy. The sea battles is boring. And the battles on maps you dont really feel that you have controll to manage more than moving. The tutorial could have been alot better.  GFx: 6 (gfx looks ok but its hard narrow the maps with all small details) SFx: 7-10 (music is ok and fits the game) Gameplay: 3-10  I cant recommend this game.
302330,Tex Murphy: Mean Streets,"This should be an old-school point and click adventure. Instead, its also an extremely monotonous flight simulator. Half of the game is spent in a 'speeder' flying around a wasteland of random colors and shapes. In addition to that, you need write down a couple pages of information to remember ('nav' codes for locations, passwards, passcards, etc.) There is still potential here though, as the story is very intriguing and sometimes worth working through."
302340,Tex Murphy: Martian Memorandum,"Second part of Mean Streets - P.I. Tex Murphy adventure game. There is a point&amp;click interface, so questioning of witnesses it's much easier.  Graphics is getting old now and is in low resolution, but it's ok: it's still quite clear and pleasant. Had to be great in 1991. The story is the strongest part of the game: is very interesting and have a lot of humor elements. Summation: not that good as Mean Streets, but still a lot of fun. Very good detective game.  P.S. I have this game on Steam, but i played it on Android's DosBox."
302350,Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon,"THIS is the Tex Murphy series I've heard so much hype about? They got James Earl Jones to work on THIS?  I played the first few minutes of the game and quit because I just couldn't stand it. If it had just been the horrible controls and amateurish video editing then I'd have put my head down and pressed on, but that's the least of the problems with this 'game.'  To put it bluntly, this game is basically what you'd get if you hired Friedberg and Seltzer to make a parody of the detective noir genre and cast a second-rate Jim Varney impersonator in the lead. The acting, editing, script, and direction aren't just bad enough to break immersion; they're so bad that you're never immersed in the first place."
302360,Tex Murphy: The Pandora Directive,"Truely awesome game. Had this back in the day but forgot how good it really was. The story line is great and the puzzles are devious but not un-doable with a little logic. All in all, it took me 38 hours to complete. ( although that includes time spent going off to make a cup of tea while I thought about where to go next) . Some of you may find that the initial scenes, discussions and traveling a little tedious at first but the game does become more exciting as it goes on.  The Tex Murphey games are the leaders in this genre. IMO."
302370,Tex Murphy: Overseer,I think i reached my limit in this game. I keep getting error messages as i am at Gideons house using the poles to try and get across the pressure sensitive floor. As a kid i played this game and would get stuck all the time because we didnt have a strategy guide online to follow like i do now. Makes it a lot easier but it is also a clear MUST if your going to play this game. Anyone thats says its cheating and they never used it is a liar OR they spent YEARS trying to beat this game. If they can fix the game i will finish it. As of now i am S.O.L. !
302380,Floating Point,Imagine a ball that can web swing like spider-man with amazing music playing.
302390,Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness,"I want to recommend this as a little point and click piece of history, especially has a Microids fan, but there's a bug that looks to never get a fix that cuts out a major cutscene AND locks you out of the final part of the game because it causes an important menu (the alchemy kit) to be grayed out. Without the key in that menu, you can't finish the game. There is a save file out that lets you fix the later issue, but the former issue remains unaddressed.  Best find other ways to play this one."
302440,Roadside Assistance Simulator,What could have been a novel car repair time-waster is handicapped by the inclusion of an incredibly tedious mini-game in which you dispatch recovery vehicles around a fictional county.  90% of the time you'll spend with this game will be spent frustrated and bored wishing you could just do the next repair scenario.
302460,I Am Vegend,"Wasn't a bad game. Only took me about 2 hours to beat. Reminds me of plants vs zombies. I really wish you could pick the plants you use per map, but o well. I bought it for a dollar, for an App/mobile game it was worth it."
302470,Battle Mages,"This game's concept has real potential. Personal magic abilities that you can level combined with RTS elements really do seem like they would be interesting. But this game's implementation isn't polished enough to find enjoyment in the concept.  The UI is very clunky, some menu items couldn't even be read. The sound is painfully monotonous - 'Yes!' and 'At your command!' became so annoying, I just had to turn all sound off. Would have been nice to have a 'Unit feedback' slider or even toggle.  But really it was the gameplay that made this painful. A common bug I experienced was a unit getting 'hung up' on something invisible, and a few members of the unit would stay behind, and the others would move at a snails pace with the formation. That was basically a level-restart situation. Also the game involved soooooo much marching. The ratio of time spent marching units between objectives and actually doing interesting things, like fighting and casting spells, was way off.  So, potentially good, and it might be worth it for the curious. But for those looking for a fun RTS, I cannot recommend it."
302490,Ballad of Solar,Skip. Only my rule of finishing a game I've purchased kept me going.
302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,"The games graphics are incredible, lighting and skin textures are very well done.  BUT... The game play is just aweful. Keyboard or controller commands are taxing at best. Typical 5-10 against 1 scenarios. And then you have a classic BOSS fight... YAWN.   3 out of 5 ONLY Because of the graphics   "
302570,Dangerous,"I like the premise of the game and the graphics. What I don't like are the controls that on the one hand don't offer enogh options and on the another hand are too complicated or confusing. While the game's tutorial tries to show you around (and quite well succeeds in that even, I enjoyed it), it didn't manage to teach me how to fly the ship. And since none of the many buttons have hover text, I wasn't able to learn by myself. If the memory load (player's, not computer's) could be lessened, I would like the game much more and probably would even continue it."

302610,Boson X,Pretty challenging. fun to play if you have 30 minutes to waste

302670,Call to Arms, Early Access Review
302690,Metal Dead,"Great adventure game overall.  Interesting weird characters, funny jokes, unique art style, long play time with the proper ending, difficulty just right.  No voice over is not an issue here."
302710,BlazeRush,Well made simple party combat racer. Shame that barely anyone plays this online...
302730,Namariel Legends: Iron Lord Premium Edition,"I dont wanna write my own since its already stated in the positive reviews. But I wanna just note that the game is very good for point and click. I just wish it was made in higher resolution.  And the amount of animation in this game is so good, I've seen this no where in other point and click."
302750,The Counting Kingdom,"Good game with nice, simple graphics. Kids enjoyed playing it while practicing their maths."
302790,Momodora III,"just bought this game tonight, and i have made a mistake. i started my first run on hard. help me"
302810,Divinia Chronicles: Relics of Gan-Ti, Early Access Review
302830,BLOCKADE 3D, Early Access Review
302850,Team Indie,"Not much to say about this game. It's fun, and sessions are short, bite sized even. I'd almost rather see this on mobile, just for how casual this game is."
302870,Stained,"The game's aesthetics are based on a great idea: an abandoned castle full of monsters made of shards of stained glass. The visuals look great. Unfortunately, Stained's gameplay is too excruciating to experience its beauty properly. Controls are unresponsive, and the player character moves so slow it feels like you are walking through thick jelly. Battles require some precise jumping and attacking, since every enemy has its week spot and attack patern, but the controls make seemingly trivial battles frustrating and unwinnable.  I have struggled with the first boss for about fifteen minutes, then, when I finally killed it, the game crashed. I decided it was a sign from above and dropped it like a jagged piece of broken glass."
302910,The House,"So glad I didn't buy this game. I would love to be able to say more than 'It's terrible' But I couldn't get beyond 10 minutes of gameplay. The very few light sources you get run out so fast you don't even have time to find others, and when you run out you're met with solid blackness and no ability to carry on. The controls are dire as well and (from my attempts anyway) There are no means to change them, however I could be wrong because this game was so laughable I didn't bother to try very hard."
302950,Heileen 1: Sail Away,"I gave it a chance even if most people didn't recomend it... Big mistake. This game is by far one of the worst I have played. The story was just confusing and the main character (Heileen) is the most narcissistic and shallow person I have ever come across in a game. The second game is better, but still I would not recomend that either. I do own the third game, but I have yet to make myself wanna play it. I bought all three as a bundle and thankfully they where on sale, so I didn't have to pay much."
302970,Radiant Defense,"There's an element of randomness to any tower defense game, but this one is...well, it's remarkably inconsistent. Most of the towers have a firing arc and a set rotation speed, but the AI on the towers loves to point them in the least helpful direction. If you fail a wave, restarting it and changing nothing about your tower placements and upgrades is just as likely to bring a win as reworking everyhing that you previously tried.  The game isn't outright bad, but it's meant to kill time as it's nothing more than a port of a smartphone game.   "
303210,The Beginner's Guide,"It was ok for $4.99 (Stanley Parable devs made it, so I think of it as a tip) I was told The Beginner's Guide had some feels, can't say I felt much.    P.S. If you're looking for some feels try Life is Strange while it's free:    "
303290,OZMAFIA!!,"1. Ok, so, I bought the OZMAFIA!! Should try to run it without a walkthrough!..  2. Hey, I am already ~5 hours here and still haven’t entered any route. Is it ok?..   This game has a strong HnKnA vibe! On the other note, Caramia is cute, art is cute, music is cute, that episode with drunk Fuka is cute, Kyrie and skipping important scenes are not cute at all  .  3.    Caramia: I love you! Fuka: I love you too! Caramia &amp; Fuka: We are dating now!    Me: EEEEEEEEE, the game has finally started!..  4.    Fuka: I saw Caramia with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! Axel: She saw you with a ♥♥♥♥. Caramia: It’s not, what it looks like… I should talk to her.    Me: Yeah, talking is important! Be brave, say her, how you really feel, say, how hard it is for you to control yourself around her ~  5.    Caramia: I’ve just decided, we should break up. You can go to Axel, he likes you and has more free time. Fuka: Roger, understood!    Me: WUUU-  6.    Fuka: We’ve just broken up with Caramia. I need some advice. Axel: Take me! I love you more, than he ever did! Even if I am just a replacement for walking, talking and sex, I am more than happy with it! Fuka: Great idea! It seems, like I haven’t loved Caramia in the first place!    Me: WUUU- FUKA, STOP!!! Fuka, why are you sleeping with him, WE ARE IN CARAMIA’S ROUTE!!! Fuka, we spammed him with visits for several hours, he cared about you so much and was so protective and didn’t touch you, BUT YOU'VE JUST JUMPED TO SOMEONE'S BED, WHEN YOU GOT A FIRST CHANCE???  7.    Axel: *became addicted to Fuka and started to suffer* Fuka: How cute, how cute..! Kyrie: Fuka, forget about him, let’s go to the date with me and Caramia and sleep all together!    Me: …Is it some kind of the BAD END or something?  8. THE END. The situation with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is still unresolved. Caramia absolutely forgot about Fuka, Fuka absolutely forgot about Caramia. Zero depth of thoughts and relationship. Empty words, stupid deсisions. I need vodka and a walkthrough. =\  P.S. Started to like Kyrie. Cognition comes through comparison."
303310,The House in Fata Morgana,The least   anime   visual novel on Steam.
303340,Concursion,"I really liked the concept of this game a lot. Mixing the basics of some classic game types into zones, and they creating semi-new mechanics out of this interaction is very cool. The art, animations, and sometimes non-clear transitions can be jarring at times, but I would LOVE to see a second version of this game when they can maybe make it 2.5D and add/fix some things. Some people have some decent critiques of the game, I can agree with some, but the levels are short and there's plenty of checkpoints, so the little naggly things (for instance, those teeny-tiny asteroids of pain, that are hard me to see against the background!) didn't bug me too much, ESPECIALLY since this is such a cool, unique idea.  I definitely recommend getting and playing it, it's cheap, and it's a pretty well-done project. I'm really hoping the developer comes back to this concept for a sequel to make a refined version of this game with some of the following elements fixed/changed (they weren't deal breakers for me, but I hope the second incarnation of this game has these changes).  1) 2.5D like trine, bittrip runner 2, etc 2) More control over zoom-view (sometimes sections would be artificially too hard based upon how much area around the character you can see) 3) Analog control of movement - I know it's 'retro' to have digital control of movement input, but I think it would serve to expand the game with analog movement. 4) Control over zone change - this I'm not so super sure about, but I think it would be awesome if done correctly  *I'll add more if I can think of them."
303390,Dead Bits,"  I highly recommend this game, this is better than Black ops 3. The story is great, this game is just a masterpiece, everything is awesome in this game.    The Story"
303430,Roundabout,"Fun game, but won't let me play saves. In addition, it crashes mid-game for me. If it worked, I would recommend it, but it just won't work for me, and I don't know why."
303470,Rush for Glory,"Its a solid tower defense game that is nice and polished. But its just soooo long.  At first the game is epic with like 5 wave games. Not too short not too long. Keeps you at the edge of your seat.  But then as you progress, the developers mistakenly think that more waves = more fun and the games start becoming like 20-30 wave games without the ability to pause or save in the middle. and it takes HOURS. Literally you will fall asleep at your keyboard.  Instead of being a game of strategy and fun, it becomes a game of endurance. To force yourself to stay awake till the end "
303510,Dungeons: The Eye of Draconus,"...worst and gayest game I've ever played.   There's absolutely nothing about this game that's even remotely good or worth your time. The dialog and characters are just one bad gay joke after another. The combat is slow and clunky. A 5 year old Autistic kid could slap together a better story while baning their head against a wall. That's pretty much what this game is like, banging your head against a wall, both because it's so bad and you've wasted your time and money on it. That's time you could have used doing something better like taking a dump. This game is so bad you should lose points on your steam profile just for having it in your library."
303530,Sentris,There is not really anything that motivates you to play. There is little feedback on what you do or what you can do to improve . There is no sort of goal or rewards that can drive you toward improving.
303590,Hidden in Plain Sight,Very fun game to play locally with friends. There are several game modes in which players need to blend in with NPCs to avoid being spotted by the others. Meanwhile players need to complete an objective like stealing most coins or race to the finish line.
303680,FATE: The Traitor Soul,Horrible. Just horrible.
303690,FATE: The Cursed King,"Great game series, so much to do, already 50 hours into it and im not even half way throught the game.  A MUST BUY FOR OLD FASHION RPG PEOPLE OR DIABLO LOVERS!"
303710,Monomino,Game is a little glitchy. The little baby dudes will freeze. It messes up the score because it thinks you missed one.
303720,#killallzombies,Badly Ported game
303790,Faery - Legends of Avalon,"I couldn't play this game for very long. Irritating music and the graphics quality leaves something to be desired. The controls are not great--for a fairy, my character felt very heavy and hard to maneuver. The dialogue is also unskippable. If you start a conversation with a character, prepare to be there for however much time the game thinks you need to read something.  I was interested in the idea: Playing a customized fairy out to save the magical realm from dying. Customization is very limited, however. Yes, you can choose a variety of skin and hair colors, but the hairstyles themselves are few. Needless to say, I didn't get very far in the game."
303800,The Witcher Adventure Game,"Its good, but could be better with some animations"
303830,Motorcycle Club,"Pros: - Smooth gameplay *Very important - Well optimized game *Very important - Unlimited FPS *Very important - Nice graphics - Different gameplay style - alternate between motos while racing - Many challenges to do - Many motos to buy - Many tournaments and gold medals to get - Many achievements - Customizable keyboard layout - Arcade  Cons: - Many times game crashes when loading the main menu - Sometimes game performance goes down and need to restart the game to fix - Can't customize gamepad layout, however the default layout is good - Can't open Steam Overlay, however achievements and chat messages are shown - Soundtrack of 1 music, but you can disable it - Game is too easy and bots doesn't alternate between motos"

303860,Machines At War 3,"Your enemies can build wherever they please, but you can't. They build whatever they please wherever they please. You, on the other hand, can't build anything unless you have vision. Even after you build the 'Eagle Eye', which gives you full map coverage, you still can't build anything unless you have a unit nearby.   0/10. LASW was far better than this pile of garbage."
303870,Blinding Dark,"Amnesia without stealth but with guns, stupid monsters and lags."
303880,TriBlaster,"Tags : Arcade  Removing from library because : 1. Most people who got to play this say that its not enjoyable due to pacing 2. Dev has not worked on this release, just milking what he could out of it to fund his other project 3. Game is Joystick only and I dont have my controllers with me anyway. I tried rebinding in the launcher but it wouldnt work  Conclusion : Waste of HDD space - bundle fodder title :("
303910,Time of Fury,"This is a game for hardcore wargamers. It is like Panzer general end Hearts of Iron had a love child, you get the features of both: scaling the turn based Panzer general to a much higher strategic level like that of HoI with a simplification of hearts of iron features when it comes to managing your country like diplomacy, economy, managing leadership etc.  The downside is that you have many many many units which all need management making it tedious and makes the AI overburdened which takes long turns to calculate. This could make you feel bored if you are not into the genre enough, for hardcore wargamers who always need more wargames this is a must have though   8/10"
303940,CAPSULE,"Capsule is a narrative-driven game about a stranded astronaut trying to get home. The gameplay is delivered through a radar screen. It is ostensibly a first person game: you play as the astronaut, who is sealed inside the cramped capsule, and navigates with the radar screen to pick up reserves of air and fuel while evading enemies, always trying to reach a space station.  Pros: Spooky atmosphere. Feels like I am driving an escape pod from the Nostromo. Tight controls. No tutorial level. The game is simple enough to pick up as one goes along. Increased complexity as game goes forward. Great gameplay balance. Go fast when low on air, poke along slowly and methodically when low on fuel. Blow up pursuing drones by luring them into mines.  Cons: Lame nemesis. You meet a malevolent organism in the end game who gives you a devils choice, but he has a stupid voice-over and there is no choice but to accept his offer. Expensive. I got the game for $0.99 during a sale but the full MSRP of $5 isn't worth it. No replay value and about a 1 hour experience. Confusing enemy and pickup names. I thought nitrox would replenish my breathing air, since air is actually mostly nitrogen with some oxygen, but it didn't replenish my air reserves. No introduction. After beating the game, I started a new campaign, and it really isn't clear why the protagonist is in space, in the dire straits he finds himself in.  Overall, this game would be a cool introduction to start a narrative, but it's too short to justify the $5 price. Buy on a sale though.  "
304050,Trove,To put it simply. It's bad don't get it buy terraria instead like; this game is trash.

304240,Resident Evil,"Resident Evil HD Remaster is one of my new favorite games. One-of-a-kind survival horror that mixes action with horror without breaking the tension and fear waiting at every corner.  + Horror elements: Constantly tense and creepy with effective jumpscares. + True survival horror: Resources are scarce, risk management and strategy is required. + Old-school exploration: Puzzles, secret rooms, lots of keys to find, some backtracking... + The mansion: One of the best maps ever featured in an adventure game ever. + Storytelling: A creepy and interesting plot told through simple notes, pictures and level design elements. + Replayablilty: Unlock new modes and changes to the map/gameplay after beating the game for the first time.  - The tiniest inventory: Too much backtracking to item storage. - A couple hours too long: Gets boring near the end.  True survival horror. If you like old-school-style exploration in a fantastic map with puzzles, zombies and item management, get this game.  Simolius - January 2017"
304290,Heroes Rise: The Hero Project,Will never get tired of replaying this game.
304350,Wildlife Park 2,"I'd love to say how much i enjoy this game, as i have enjoyed the mobile version on my iPad but can find no way to make it fit my screen.. understand this has been a common problem which i did not realize before i purchased it , so much as i like the mobile version i cant recommend a verrsion of the game i cant play. Get WIldlife Park Mobile instead"

304460,Qora,"This looks like a very interesting and artsy game, unfortunately it does not work for me, and after searching around several others are having the same issue.  I'd say buy with caution, the game will either instantly crash on load or will come up say loading then go to a black screen with music and freeze."
304500,Rooms: The Main Building,"Meh, it's a boring puzzle game."
304540,FreakOut: Extreme Freeride,"Game has real potential to be fun, a bit reminiscent of SSX on Tour. Too bad the controls SUCK SO TOTALLY. You cannot properly map the controls to a gamepad and once you try you cannot even reset to the Default keyboard controls so you are doubly buggered. Considering it was released for PS2 and worked with a controller on that platform it is just a very poor effort by the devs with the shoddy controls on this PC port. This factor alone ruins what could have been a fun game. If you are used to proper controls, à la SSX, you will NOT like this game. You have been warned. With the controls in such a terrible state I can in no way recommend this game as is. What a shame given the overall lack of such games on PC."
304580,CITYCONOMY: Service for your City,good game played a few times but now it wont load
304650,Sunless Sea,"Although this game is tedious to begin with, the overall experience of the game is fantastic. Sunless Sea builds upon the lore provided in the Failbetter online game, Fallen London, previously known as Echo Bazaar, where London was dragged a mile underneath the surface of the earth by bats and soon taken over by the Masters of the Bazaar. Although it's great to play these two games in tandem, it's not required.   The atmosphere in the game is definitely what makes it stand out from other top-down games I have played. Given the fact that every time you die, the map shifts itself around a little bit, provides the player with a constant question, how much fuel and how many supplies do I need to reach X without dying?   Overall, 8/10 Dying sucks"
304670,Aeon Command,dooooooooooooooood.... more people need to know about this game. The gameplay is flawless. It's exactly what you pay for and then more. I think honestly it should be more expensive because the entertainment value of it.

304750,Voodoo Chronicles: The First Sign HD - Director’s Cut Edition,what a disappointment ................... objects are in places that cant even be clicked on game is glitched hard and some items that are out in the open need to be clicked multiple times before it works i personally feel the game was a waste of money
304810,TesserAct,"Everytime I go through the door it lags a little. Shortly after the beginning bit I've reached a doorway that makes the game crash. I'm unable to get past this part in the game. From what I've seen it could have been a promising game, but I'll never find out."
304910,Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders,I only bought this game for the op british planes  10/10 would shoot down 7 enemy planes in a single life while flying a spitfire again  (jk british planes arent op they are just really good)

304950,Castaway Paradise,Closest game you will find to Animal Crossing. I really enjoy playing it but i hope they keep adding new stuff to it. Not alot of things to do tho
3050,Xpand Rally Xtreme,this it not bad. its old looking but i like it. good looking game
305010,Toxic Bunny HD,"So.... I bought on ♥♥♥ a random steam key for 0,99$  And I got this game. I was like hmm seems ok maybe funny lets play!  I started up the game and I went in easy mode. I clicked and smashed my whole keyboard and nothing happened.  3 hours later I tried it again and evertything worked out perfectly!  The jump is kinda bad and the way how you have to kill enemies is also not ok.   Buy this game? No!!"
305050,Outland,Solid metro idea is. It's a little heavy on guiding you to the next objective but keeps the mechanics interesting enough throughout to warrant a playthrough.
305070,FIST OF AWESOME,"It's OK, but it gets kinda repetitive by the third level. Still, if you enjoy 16-bit beat 'em ups, this one is worth a play through."
305260,Battle Islands,Clash of Clans clone.  Isn't interesting either.
305280,Cakewalk Loop Manager,piece of crap
305380,Blue Estate,This game is awesome.
305390,World War 2: Time of Wrath,"Waste of Money !! I paid $2.50 on steam and i still feel ripped off. THERE IS NO MANUAL AVAILABLE. You wanna use diplomacy ? Tough beans, no manual means you can't find out how. I checked company website and others. non-existent or dead links. Now i know why the company is named Wasteland."
305460,FranknJohn, Early Access Review
305480,Heileen 2: The Hands Of Fate,first of all this game has no idea what tarrot cards acctualy are. secound the main charater is a dunce. third all the 'choises' don't seem to lead to anything other then a 'good/bad' ending they seem supurfluous not anything like the game's description said. there are times when being sinful would help others and other times where it would hurt them but it's not like infamous where you are good karma bad karma it's just you were bad have a slap on the wrist or you were good here is a woman sad that you wern't there for her.
305490,Heileen 3: New Horizons,"If not on sales it’s already $15 less here as it has all romances!  This sequel starts right from boarding the pirate ship.  You can focus on learning abilities and think of directing towards its virtue or sin for a profession. You can romance a man or a woman but you must finish the game with one or the other. I’ve done male romances before steam so cool I’ll do female romances for free.   Each character represents a profession: Lora dancer, Otto is faith, Marie farming…each character will have a bonus/penalty/neutral effect on learning. There are great artworks for each profession screenshot ( click on trading cards to see character's ;) ) It’s interesting to read the text during lessons cut scenes. The romance speech is good too: seduction, cut scenes by a waterfall, on the beach with suggestive pictures to appreciate entirely. Sexual innuendo can be poetic or rude according to the character or ambiance.   Some stuff: - An arm-wrestling between Sebastian and Morgan, a picky Juliet, a jealous Ebele, a flirty John &amp; Jonathan, Black the cat - An enchanting soundtrack. - You’ll have made Heileen evolve in the end.   Tips: Notice which virtue/sin ability is applied to who to better progress in your endings. Do it on your own at first, this way you can see how a character react when you displease him.  Keep a game with a basic or advanced ability common to 2 persons you’ll flirt so as to gain some playing time, then you’ll reload from it and target the other person. The drawback of this game is to play the full game for either a profession or a romance that’s why I recommend to have saves as shortcuts to cumulate a bit with 2 professions with the common ability for example.  Skipping text is very helpful for next playthrough to get faster to new scenes. Unlocked endings can be seen again from the menu, you have a few silly jokes too."

305660,Infect and Destroy, Early Access Review
305740,Pitiri 1977,"I liked this game until a bug prevented me from picking up the fourth power. This was after several hours of play. Even when I restarted from my saved game, the bug persisted, preventing me from progressing. Uninstalled. Complete waste of my time."
305760,Redirection,"Gameplay: This game has a very decent amount of content with a load of challenging levels you can spend your time on and the fun robot arcade where you are able to play minigames like pong or tetris. The game has essentially an unlimited amount of content as the game can be modded by everyone who owns the game. This includes creating your own robot arcade games, levels, theme songs, textures and storylines.  Performance: The game is quite small in storage size, so no hours of waiting required as the game loads its assets. The graphics are what you would expect from such an arcade game and the game runs beautifully thanks to good optimization.  Bonus: awesome geek references.  9/10 Needs more turtles :3"
305780,Echo of the Wilds,"Can't you not wait to longleggedly lunge into a spiraling splinter of splendid splattery spliffsmoking? This most maddening meandering mess of mischeviousness will make you massively and incomprehensibly vomit pukily and unpleasantly monitorwards before slamming your roundish gooified brainy case against thine shinily sparkiling keyboard thingy thing. The stumbling and strained stupid stammering of wordly bits that oozes forth betwixt pretty pixelly artistry is surely sure to make you wishy wish you hadn't spent dollary creditsuch on such a monkeylife typing randomliness electricwise. Did I sayeth pretty pixellations, because aforesaid prettiliness is vanquished with vigorousness during creep-clouded loadingy screensuchity.  (I didn't like the game, and wish I didn't buy it.)"
305800,POP: Methodology Experiment One,"Ugh, wow okay so when I read that this game was 'designed music first, with the gameplay and aesthetic derived from the creative flow of the music production process' I thought HEY here's a game that will play like I'm watching the soundscape of some good music unfold in front of me comprised of loosly related video clips and mini-games that somehow associate with the energy of the music COOL!  Well, ya, you know, in theory that would be cool. This game absolutely did not feel like that for me. Maybe I didnt play it long enough but after the opening sequence really felt like it was testing my resilience against having an epileptic seisure, then subsequent mini-games which make no sense, the music feeling like it was not the star of the show, and literally feeling like I WAS going to have a seisure, I had to turn this game off...  I'm not really sure what they were going for here but honestly I have to say that what this game does best is cause confusion and induce seisures. I mean, literally... before you can play the game it makes you accept that it might kill you before proceeding. COOL  Anyway look, it just wasnt a pleasant experience. You could make an argument that the art and video clips in this game are supposed to get at some deeper meaning about the state of society and moral blah blah but that aspect of this game really was not executed well. If you want to play a game which lambasts the shotcomings of modern society try this lesser known dystopian gem: 'Beyond good and evil' There are others but I really need to go lay down after playing this game... My head feels fuzzy : \  Update: 30 minutes later - legit still feeling like I put my brain in a blender"
305820,Cute Things Dying Violently,"This is alot like Angry birds, especially the concept. A puzzle game where you fling cute little things to their elevator destination and hopefully they dont get all cut up."
305840,Shallow Space, Early Access Review
305860,AutoTileGen,"It seems to be an easy way to do tiles. I was enjoying, the interface could be improved, but that wasn't my main problem. When I export 16x16 tiles, I don't get 16x16 tiles. I still do not know what I get actually. I tried to figure out and when I compared my preview and my end file, they were different! Maybe there is a safety offset but I didn't find any config to set this. And I still don't know what it is the offset.  Well, I won't spend my time trying to figure out this. I'll be drawing my tiles in an actual pixel art software. I really wanted AutoTileGen to be good. It's a good idea that fails because small issues. I hope the developer improve this tool (and I'll sure update my review if things get better). But for now, I can't recommend it."
305880,Leona's Tricky Adventures,"This cozy, relaxing puzzle game is the successor to Gem'X - one of the most loved Amiga games. It features the same classic Chris Huelsbeck soundtrack but extends the original game with charming new characters and map-based exploration.   The puzzles involve clicking on gems to change their colour to match what's on the right hand side of the screen. The gem you click moves two steps along the range of colours, and the gems surrounding it change one step. So you have to carefully plan your clicks. It's much more intuitive than I make it sound, and the game features a nice tutorial so the gameplay soon becomes clear.  An absorbing game that positively exudes good vibes. recommended!"
305920,Another Perspective,"A puzzle platformer that immediately draws comparisons to Braid visually, but honestly distinct enough to be its own game. It also makes me think of that weird ♥♥♥ game about time travel with that victorian era snidely whiplash lookin son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ called PB Winterbottom or something because you rely on other versions of yourself doing certain things in certain sequences in order to solve puzzles and get keys and open doors. It's pretty good, actually, and it's short enough that I'll be able to finish the main stuff up without much problem.  I've kind of got mixed feelings about the puzzle platformer genre in general because they're so prevalent these days and very few actually stand out as something special. I'd say that Braid is one of the best but when I try to think of any other standouts off the top of my head, it's really kind of difficult to do. As always, it seems to go back to the problem of mimicking a formula vs understanding why the formula is successful but maybe it's even more noticeable in this genre because it's so difficult to come up with unique mechanics related to solving puzzles. Anyway, for being a cheapo, you could do a lot worse than Another Perspective"

305980,Heavy Fire: Afghanistan,10/10  Great gameplay. Takes a true god to beat this game. Would play again
306000,Super Dungeon Bros,This game is awesome =]
306020,Bloons TD5,"Great game, although I hate when I get afk team mates in Co-op"
306040,The Howler,"Even though this type of puzzler isn't for me, it is still a nice game. Not fond of the gamestyle, but controls are easy to understand and this game has a magnificent drawing style."
306130,The Elder Scrolls Online,"EDIT: Constantly 999+ms and kick me off the server for no reason. During the helloween event was nice and fun. I recommended my friends and what they get is 999+ms for hours and no fix after few server maintanance.   Old review: I'm not so experienced compared to thousand hours players yet but just some recommendation for the level thingy: - The main quest is weird, the prophet says will summon me again then I he just summon me after 1 minutes. This is due to one tamriel thing but I recommend make it like Skyrim just continue whenever player wants. - The creatures scales to player level could me made like this so player feel the difference when they get stronger: level 10 - normal skeleton takes 7 hits, boss takes 20 hits level 60 - normal skeleton takes 4 hits, boss takes 17 hits  instead of same hits all time which is boring, even though the level scales but just boring. it feels very weird when u look at the hp bar and u deal the same damage with someone champian level 500+ when you are newbie.  The system is very well and balanced. zero pay 2 win. enjoy it so far. Its considered very expensive in my country so really hard to ask friend to join me. The starting is very boring and I almost give up, should be improved. Starting should be fantasy instead of asking me to help peoples (investigate) I dont know which is no connection to my main story."
306200,The Happy Hereafter,"This is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. I got it as it was extremely cheap, thought it'd be an alright time waster, but about five minutes in and I loved it. I can't even really say why I love it. Maybe it's due to the tasks being constant so I didn't really stop doing things, and there's a lot to do at once, so I didn't get bored. I will definitely continue playing this: the only reason I'm even stopping right now is that I should probably try to get some sleep."
306260,Selknam Defense,"Good tower defense game, colorful graphics, some story. The difficulty ramps up like a b*tch every once in a while, but otherwise it's fine."
306350,Slipstream 5000,"Nominated, played &amp; reviewed this game in steam autumn sale 2016. xD"
306410,Crystals of Time,"A lot of backtracking (also with wild guessing where to backtrack), constant reusing of hidden object scenes during which you have to find the same or almost the same objects, no voice, no indication that you use wrong object and at the same time very imprecise clicking, so you have no idea if you're doing something wrong or just not aiming THAT well.  And the game is just ugly. Sorry, but after looking at it for almost 2 hours this is the word that comes to my mind. UGLY.  The one thing that is positive is music. Nothing epic, but decent.  Stay with Artifex Mundi, kids."
306440,Oblitus,"This game is unfair. And I don't mean that in the good sense, like I'm saying it's hard and forces you to learn and adapt or anything. No, I mean this game is literally unfair. It kills you through things beyond your control. You can't really effectively heal, so each time you take damage you are stuck with it forever. When you die, you don't learn something so that next time you'll do better, you think 'well I sure hope next time that boss doesn't prot those two attacks in a row like that 'cause its completely unavoidable.' There are no checkpoints or permanent progression of any kind (that I've found; maybe those come later but I doubt it). Every time you die, you need to go through the whole game up till that point, and you need to do it all perfectly or you just die again. The best comparison I can make is that playing this game is like having to do a complete run through the entirety of N, and if you die on any level, you have to restart on level 1. Maybe you are into that; I am not. These designers learned all the wrong lessons from Dark Souls. Bonfires are there for a reason, and if you die in Dark Souls you only lose what you made a conscious decision to risk. You encouter an area, learn the area, master the area and then never have to return there again. Here it's like 'I sure hope you love the first 5 minutes of this game, cause that's what you will spend the vast majority of your time playing.'   O, and anything you hear about this game being procedurally generated is a flat out lie. I dunno if I heard that from the devs or from some other source, but the game uses a static map. Certain powerups and occasionally npcs are found in randomized locations each run, but the map itself is constant."
306480,Wildlife Park 2 - Crazy Zoo,I wouldn't recommend getting this game. While it was fun for a while it has become super buggy. I also noticed that I was getting a ton of pop ups when I went on the internet. I uninstalled the game because it was so bad I couldn't even use my internet. Uninstalled it and all the pop ups went away!
306490,Railroad Pioneer,"This game only offers steam locomotives and its missions are positioned somewhere between 1850 to 1900. The game spans across the territory of United States and the missions let you build the Trans Continental Railroad starting from New York and ending in San Francisco.  There are 10 missions and starting with the 4th, competitor AIs shows up on the map. The AI is not configurable and in some cases (and when you still didn't get the feel of the game) it can prove difficult. When fighting an AI your goal is to deliver more goods or transport more people to/from the city where you meet and compete. When someone wins the city, a monopoly sets in that lasts for 60 days. I initially owned the CD version of this game that had some major problems (memory leaks) in the 8th mission especially when building Oil Rig stations. The steam version has a similar problem (not as bad) in the 6th mission. I would just stay away from those Oil Rigs or just save before building a station there and if the lag appears just reload the game from that point. When the game lags it almost becomes unplayable. The image just freezes and the days keep going in the background. You can end up losing 90% of your time just waiting for the game to unfreeze. But there is a workaround for this, you can just increase the bribe in the city hall and bribe everyone without having to work with your trains to send/receive goods. This only happened in the 6th mission for me, but Oil Rig stations may create additional problems. Railroad Pioneer has the potential to be a great track laying and train management tycoon type game. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver smooth gameplay mostly due to bugs/memory leaks. I would say that it is a good game and if you are patient with the bugs it's a must play for train tycoon fans. Definitely not a starter for those getting into this type of game. (The graphics are better than Railroad Tycoon 3 and my opinion is that the game aged pretty well, the multiplayer is also cool but has very few scenarios)"
306550,Runers,Great game. Its a bit difficult.
306620,Frontline : Road to Moscow,"Good game from a great publisher! As a Slitherine game, I am sure this little gem will be supported by the developers, and will most likely be moddable. I have played the game for a few hours and its pretty cool...I dont want the campaign to end. Looking forward to the road back to Berlin! More than worth the eight dollars!"
306630,Civil War II,"This is the most painstakingly micro-managing crap game I have ever run across. It gives you a bunch of numbers, names of units, etc. that mean absolutely nothing. It is just one big crap shoot. Take all of the time to tediouslly make your moves and then ?????? NOTHING MATTERS! Some units don't even move, some take forever to move a couple squares, some may fight with the outcome like throwing dice, others don't even fight. They just both occupy the same town square. You end the game always feeling like you have been cheated. Because I was! What a waste of money on CRAP!! Save your money!"
306640,Battle Academy 2: Eastern Front,"  + The game has accessible UI. + Gameplay is solid. + Turn-based tactics are great, and provide a challenge. + Good variety of units that allow combined arms tactics. + Air combat and other minor abilities are a nice addition. + The graphics are reduced to minimal, but do well. + Art is great. + Sounds are nice. + Community updates add several free expansions.  - The animations are poor, wouldn't hurt to add some sprites. - Engine optimisation is poor. - Some unit abilities miss explanations. - Few minor bugs. - Even more units would add more to the game. - The campaigns are great, but lack the carry over feeling. Only the Kursk campaign does, but you have to buy the expansion.  Would have been so nice to add a continuous stream of battles with a core army from the beginning to the end of war; with several RPG choices in between and strategic options.  Highly recommend to all wargamers and ex-panzer general fans."
306660,Ultimate General: Gettysburg,"I felt like the path finding of units and moving them in general just felt too clunky. The game also did not have enough variation to keep me interested. I can see that if you like the history of american civil war this might be a good buy since there is not much better options out there as far as I know, but I expected a good solid RTS with american civil war theme - and I was disappointed."
306670,Overlord: Fellowship of Evil,"Played the game for a whole 15 minutes before I realized that the game was unplayable, luckely Steam has a great return policy. The controls and game style are nothing like Overlord I and II and the fact that killed enemies do not even seem to drop lifeforce is a real bummer.  Overlord = The master orders the minions to kill sheepies, the sheepies drop shinies and the minions bring the shinies to the master. Seen nothing like that in this game."
306680,Lexica,"Good game, only recommend for those who like puzzle AND are good at english. You have to be extremely good at it. Half of those words I did not knew and I am not that bad at english. I rate this game   7/10  ."
306700,Iron Fisticle,"Twin stick arcade shooter. Nice pixel art and very addictive gameplay and great co-op fun. Don't bother if you're one of those new-gen gamers that wants victory handed to you on a plate between a myriad of checkpoints... Like any old school game should be, this game is hard! Be ready for a challenge."
306760,Obduction,"This is a painful review to write, unfortunately the game promises so much but delivers on so little that I have to review it poorly.  This statement is true of pretty much everything, for example the story is crazy imaginative and exotic, but the actual story is depressingly short (there is zero 'world building' outside of establishing the premises of whats going on) and so once you're done it kinda feels like... ok uh, i guess that's it? The same general feeling goes for environmental design, level design and other aspects. Lots of promise, but the product is deceptively small in total.  Now my biggest issue and the products largest failing. It is a TERRIBLE puzzle game. I feel bad saying this cause it comes across harsh, but the puzzles can mostly be stumbled through without thinking too hard especially the large, pretty tactile ones which is a huge no-no. I spent maybe MAYBE 30m thinking about puzzles, 3h searching for environmental clues (I hate environmental clue puzzles, but this is a personal preference thing. When you get sufficiently picky anything looks like a sequence of digits) and easily 8h were spent just running back and forth to do the thing I'd already figured out.  This is a huge cardinal sin with puzzle games, and for some reason I feel the need to express this here: PLEASE when you are designing puzzles, it is INCREDIBLY important to keep this ratio in mind:  Execution time / Thinking time  keep this ratio as small as possible. It should be near 0, 0.1-0.2 is best speaking roughly. In Obduction this ratio is probably easily in the 20s or 30s most of the time, possibly 100s and sometimes divergent (when you solve a 'puzzle' just by pushing the next thing in front of you, which is possible deceptively often.)  The reason this occurs (and I know this has been spoiled in other reviews) is because of [THE MECHANIC]. [THE MECHANIC] gets introduced pretty quickly, and MAN is it cool. It introduces a lot of nifty possibilities in terms of puzzles and I was SO. SO. SO. pumped to see it in action. Unfortunately in practice [THE MECHANIC] just means pressing one button and seeing what it does, repeat ad infinitum. AND WORST OF ALL, [THE MECHANIC] has, we'll call it an animation time, that is *excessively* long for technical reasons (10+s easily).  The result of this is that puzzles are about 5s of figuring out the right thing to do, and just a bajillion forevers of doing the motions. It is so ♥♥♥♥ing taxing and irritating and you will have to be a saint to come out the other end feeling positively about it. Probably because of this the design team felt constrained to keep the puzzles simple (which i guess is fair, I would probably have quit if I wasted lots of time to come to false conclusions and have to undo them) but the end result is that there's no thinking, hours of execution time and no ability to enjoy the game.  On the off chance the design team sees this I do have a recommendation. [THE MECHANIC] suffered because it was applied too often and repeatedly in the same puzzle. What it needed was more instances where it interacted with other, more classical mechanics or environmental tricks in order to make mind-bending puzzles that only used [THE MECHANIC] sparingly. How to do this, yeah that's definitely tricky. I think the best game this could take inspiration from is The Witness, who's tunnel-minded focus on one puzzle can still be fun because it's all thinking + immediate reward, instead of the exact opposite.  So yes TL;DR:  I cannot recommend this game, at all, even if it was on sale. The reason is that this is a game who's primary cost is your *time* and time is just too valuable to be wasted running back and forth this much.  That being said, I don't really regret buying the game as I appreciate it's creative potential and deviation from norms. It just needs more focus on things that make classical puzzlers good."
306930,BattleSpace,"I played this game (which turned out to be nothing more then a redirect to a browser) for all of three minutes, however, it states that ive put 76 hours into the game. something is exceptionally fishy and shady here."
306950,Heroes & Legends: Conquerors of Kolhar,I finished up the game and it was a pretty decent casual game. It have general rpg element e.g. assigning 'ability points' to a character on the fly. Something else is the resource management of gear and stats. It's linear and something that seems fine to pass the time when you don't have a lot of time to play or if you want something that doesn't necessarily take a lot of effort to play.
307010,Northmark: Hour of the Wolf,"A casual rpg with card combat. It gave me the feeling of a Big Fish type of game and I later found out it actually was sold there before the Steam release.  The story is very simple with a lot of fetch quests to slowly reveal the plot. The mystery antagonist wasn't very hard to figure out and eventually you finish the story by fighting them.  Combat, although simple as well, is the meat of the game. You pick up to three creature cards to use in battle. They have HP and resistances. You start with a hand of 7 cards from your deck and it's always replenished to the full 7. Your deck is made up of (up to 12) ability cards you choose and a standard set of random weak generic cards. Cards you play are cycled back into your deck so you'll be able to use the same card every few turns. Ability cards are either attack cards (deal X damage) or buff/debuff cards (add attack/defense/status effects).  You take turns using ability cards until one side loses all their creature cards. You want your creatures to stay alive (and you want to focus fire the enemy) because each creature still alive lets you play a card in a round. So if you have three creatures and your enemy one, you can play three cards for every single card the enemy plays, and vice versa.   As you progress through the RPG story you get new cards by buying them in stores or finding them in stashes or riddle-chests. The more (and better) cards you manually add to your deck, the less chance that you'll draw the mediocre generic cards.  Damage is split into five damage types - Physical/Fire/Ice/Magic/Poison. Type doesn't matter as long as you attack with something the enemy isn't resistant to (5 fire damage is equal to 5 ice damage if they have no resistances).  On creature cards, regular physical resist is the most common defence and it felt like ice resist was the second-most common. I don't remember fighting many enemies that actually used ice damage so it was kinda strange. I guess if you want an even easier time, don't play as the ice mage.  The initial character selection only affects initial stats (3-4 points worth), creature card and two custom deck cards. I picked the ice mage because I like casters but there isn't too much difference between classes. You can use any card regardless of class.  It seems like they use the same text for all characters. The Ice Mage is female but there are several times the NPCs reference you as a male.  Pretty simple to 100% in a single playthrough. There are more things to collect than what's needed to 100% so you can miss a few and still get the achievements.  I played as an Ice Mage and there were only two times I needed to buy cards to progress, everything else was from the free cards you can find in stashes. The first time was around the druid arc, I had almost exactly 5000 gold saved up and bought an Angel creature card to win a battle. I didn't buy anything else until the final battle.  Other thoughts:    While setting up buffs/debuffs is nice, sometimes it feels like (unless the effect is amazing) it's better to just deal damage because enemy HP usually isn't that high. Each turn sooner that you knock out an enemy creature is a turn that the enemy loses an attack.    In the forums, the developer said that they increased the difficulty for the steam release so the Big Fish version was even easier.    The game crashes if you try to battle with 0 creature cards. It shouldn't really let you get that far.    The grammar seemed to be fine until the ending where it felt like a non-native speaker took over.   Worth a look if you want a casual, simple, straightforward game and like the idea of the simple card battle system."
307030,Fractured Soul,"I'm not sure how it plays solo, but in coop it's a blast. First few levels are pretty basice, but then you have to just read each other thoughts to do everything right. And you have to do it right. Also checkpoints are usually well located, so the game will not send you to frustration even though the difficult can sometimes be pretty high."
307050,Shan Gui,"It's a very sweet story - a kinetic novel with no interaction and takes about an hour to complete, but a sweet and charming story with a peaceful soundtrack and excellent artwork. The English translation is surprisingly top-notch - there are a few grammar issues here and there but far less than you'd expect in something written by someone who doesn't speak English as a first language, but that aside the overall command of the language is elegant and superior to that of many VNs created by native English speakers.   The real shame though is the drama between the developers and publishers where apparently the developers are bilked out of the Steam distribution rights and payments,  https://steamcommunity.com/app/307050/discussions/0/357287304431021101/   "

307090,Fancy Skulls, Early Access Review
307130,Asteria,sandbox game with real content
307170,Borealis,"A sort of relaxing take on bullet-hell genres, Borealis is an interesting game if you want to pass the time.  I'd recommend getting it if the price is a dollar or below."
307190,Nicole,It's ok ^-^
307210,Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Hour,"  It's a funny little game with great comedy, I love the visuals, as I am a fan of the simplistic cartoonish stle this game uses. Overall the way it plays is lovely, it's short, it's stupid (In a good way) And it's silly, I love i.  7.5/10 Would recommend."
307230,"I, Zombie",Cool game !
307270,Super Lemonade Factory,and im super looper
307290,Velvet Sundown,"This game was the bomb when I first played it.  Unfortunately because of a dead community and the removal of text to speech, I really cant say its worth playing anymore."
307340,Platypus,This is one of those 'if you don't remember this game your childhood was awful' games. Also stay away from the garbage that is Platypus II and Nux.
307350,Nux,"Unplayable, broken and abandoned. (Idled for cards only)."
307410,Martial Arts: Capoeira,"It's an average game which could really be better, with an update from the devs to make it in HD resolution and rework the character models which are not-that-great but if you're into Capoeira or want to play a fighting game exclusively devoted to Capoeira, this is your currently best choice."

307570,A Golden Wake,"I should say upfront that I'm a fan of WadjetEye as well as Grundislav, but...perhaps BECAUSE of that, I found this game good, but disappointing.  On a positive note, I absolutely adored the setting -- the 1920s have always been a favourite period for me, and especially so in gaming. The visuals and the music match the style of the time and really get the player in the mood and mindset to explore the world of the game. I REALLY liked that this was just 'the story of a guy', so to speak...nothing flashy, or world-saving, just a man living his life and what he does and goes through in a particularly interesting time period. The side-characters were fascinating in their own right, and the ending biographies really gave a good sense of closure on a lot of faces who I had become fond of.  That being said, although I loved many of the characters in the game, I didn't find the protagonist particularly engaging. I really liked the concept that he was an imperfect man living an imperfect life, but in practice I found him to be fairly two-dimensional and his motivations a little perplexing at times (ie.   I understood that he wanted to leave the mob after his actions led to a death, but his decision to kill Fatty seemed to come completely out of left field   ). It didn't play out well for me narratively speaking and I didn't feel a great attachment to him.  However, despite this, it was an enjoyable, if fairly straightforward (no walkthroughs necessary here), foray into the genre...not the best ever produced, but worth picking up in a sale."
307580,Technobabylon,"The writing and vocal work are pretty good, all things considered. It was an interesting take on the cyberpunk setting. The gameplay is pretty standard point-and-click adventure, though, and it's fairly short. Worth a playthough if you can get it on a sale."
307590,Penarium,"If You're masochist: play the game. Otherwise, don't touch it.  Main issue with this game is that double jump sometimes works and somthimes dosn't. If You play it for some time You'll understand what I mean.  In such unforgiving game, i'ts a disaster..."
307620,Curses 'N Chaos,"I love this game already and I only played it for 30mins or so.. and died every god damned time.. still love it! I can imagine that this is EVEN more fun with a 2nd player as well. A very hard game but the art style and graphics.. Oh the art style, incredible! I'm definitely playing this a LOT more!  I got this from the Yogscast by donating btw  (https://www.humblebundle.com/yogscast-jingle-jam)   Here's me failing hard but still having so much fun:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=412Bl4g0hwc&amp;list=PLySWle9ZKHFhWj6O1PfH3hapblV1e7MlI&amp;index=19 "
307640,Stick RPG 2,Ish gud. Worth the really low price for a pretty decently long RPG. Short but sweet. Achkevements. Cheats. Yeahhh.
307670,Hard West,"Crashes on me every 5 minutes of play, controller support is not there for the wired Xbox One controller but the game looks like it has potential if the devs just keep patching. One day I hope to be able to play this game but for now it is getting steam shelved."
307690,Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition,"Really great game if you like an Asian oriental feel of Grand Theft Auto. Incorporates many great elements from GTA and expands it more with greater combat system, authentic locations of Hong Kong, and great gameplay incorporating a huge variety of missions and side missions. Overall great game, must buy for GTA lovers."
307760,Zoo Park,"It is simple game but you can still enjoy it :) It is good when you want to play something relaxing :)  0,50 cent It is worth it :)"
307770,Wildlife Park 2 - Horses,"I have just bought this and I have no idea what to do. There are no instructions and trying to do anything is a real pain, there are arrows pointing to things and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can't recommend this at all. Perhaps I'm missing something... Wish I hadn't wasted my money."
307780,Mortal Kombat X,super fun to play with friends :D
307880,Savage Lands, Early Access Review
307900,Wildlife Park 2 - Marine World,The animals in the game are a picture of the animal.is that a bug? 
307920,Wildlife Park 2 - Farm World,"very poorly done - tutorial is lacking &amp; difficult to understand - actions are even more difficult to carry out. Can't think of any pros except the graphics are OK but not fantastic. Frankly, not worth wasting my time on if it was free."
307930,Wildlife Park 2 - Dino World,"The clipping in the game while moving around is terrible, and the quests appear to not work. I was standing right next to 'Sparrow' for the first quest, and it was still asking me to find her -- I also kept getting graphical glitches where a 'rider' NPC would flash over the screen for a fraction of a second and be gone. Would not reccomend this game, it is nothing like the original Wildlife Park, which has more of a roller coaster tycoon sort of feel."
307940,Radiation Island,"This is not a well polished game as some of the reviews claim. All of its features are functional, but buggy. You can build houses, but as far as I can tell there's no point given that if you stop moving for a split second you die. I'm giving this a thumbs down for now, but I'm going to keep playing it. The developers seem nice and responsive so with some improvement I'll change it to a thumbs up.   Here's how I spent 75 minutes.  Left 'tutorial area' and got attacked by 4 wolves. Got chased by a bear. Got chased by 4 mountain lions. Got chased by two wolves that were themselves being chased by a crocodile. Got attacked by 5 mountain lions. Got attacked by tiger. Got chased by zombies. Got chased by a pack of zombies being chased by a bear. Found houses on the water. Felt safe. Checked inside boat house. Boat house had mountain lion inside. Got chased by mountain lion.  My advice to the developer:  A) Dramatically scale back the number of things that can kill you. B) Add deadly birds and sharks so that I never have to stop being chased.  There are multiple difficulty options, and the game should run well on even very old PCs. The price is perfect of not a bit generous so if you're curious it might be worth your time."
307960,IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad,"Every time after completing a mission (no matter if success or failure) all Airfields disappear from my map and I have to restart the game. And now I dont even have access to the campaigns, not even Battle of Moscow even though I bought it. Unacceptable"
307980,Cricket Captain 2014,Played as the manager of Bangladesh until 2060. The best ranking I could attain was number 7 in Test Matches. *sigh*
307990,Wildlife Park 2 - Fantasy,I got this game from a ♥♥♥♥♥ slaying attack helicopter. It is pretty good.  I enslaved some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unicorns and gave them numbers rather than real names because i think Hitlers methods were effective. I also gave them a handyman named James because he is gay and likes to play with drill tools. Unfortunately for my zoo's visitors my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horses died within a few minutes because of thirst. I imagine they were glad that they died because of being around James so much as he is a welsh individual who would probably shag them for the rest of eternity if they had immortality.   Overall id say this game is pretty good. I rate 9/11.

308040,Back to Bed,"A fun and interesting little game, but being only 1 hour long makes it hard to recommend. 6/10"
308080,Wing Breakers,   Early Access Review
308173,Hegemony III: Clash of the Ancients,So It's not BAD. It's just not good.  Pro side: Interesting (and somewhat frustrating at the start) resource management.  Not the typical style of RTS and makes it more feel like you're in ancient days. It also makes you think about food and moral of cities AND your units.  Con:  It's pretty repetitive after a short time and after you get the hang of things. On normal dificulty anyway if you pick one of the southern 'tribes' the correct path is 'Make Hoplites'. The AI won't make them and only make more of the cheaper less tough units. Hoplites will just crush them w/o taking many losses so you won't need to go re recruit.  Random AI aggression: Seems like the game will randomly decide a nation who's been quiet with you for a while will 'get a new and hostile leader. WAR!' which is kinda lazy honestly. It kinda feels the way the game is set up that there should be political mechanics as well. Maybe that just flows from the repitition thing though.   UI: Shocking. I had to restart at least a dozen games before I didn't accidentally cripple myself messing up the basics.   Graphics aren't great. Not an issue for me for this type of game but might be for you?  Maybe get it when it's on 75% off?  
308180,Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery : Episode 2,this game can kiss my ♥♥♥
308270,Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager,"great remake of BARIS and so fulfilling that you want to replay it but only to realize that the replay value is nill:(  what i pity is that you simply rehearse what the great minds in both space agencies had done. you are not on your own. you dont fly your own creativity but simply follow strict menu given to you. although having its own con, Kerbal gives you much more freedom and fun.  "
308330,Lost Chronicles of Zerzura,"This is Cranberry's last adventure game and sadly also their worst. It's far too easy and the story isn't very interesting. The environments are really nice, but character modelling and animations feel 10 years older than the rest of the game.  Their older titles in the Black Mirror series are far better, play those instead."
308360,LogiGun,"Great little puzzle game. Had to use a walkthrough on a few levels but thats because I'm not as perfect as you all seem to think I am. Well I am pretty perfect then but stop going on about it. OK, I'm as cool as the tip of an eskimos tool but leave it at that now stop complimenting me. Look, I know I'm the business but this isn't about me it's supposed to be about the game so lets talk about that. As I was saying the game is great, but not as great as me!"
308380,Airship Dragoon,"I've only been playing 5 hours.  WARNING: This game is very slow paced.   MAPPING:   It's easy to get disorientated. Needs a minimap on the battle screen to quickly reference where your units are in relation to each other.   The large Map function should show landmarks (buildings, roads, environment, fauna) and not just show blips as units and a 'T' as a flag.  BATTLE:  The pistol shooting sound is wrong. Pistol sounds like a rifle imo.  Needs more background sound effects. Like stepping sounds of the soldiers. Soldiers need to make more vocal noise too.  When locking on an enemy it should give you the percentage of chance of hitting an enemy, not just the distance. This is so you you don't waste ammo on impossible shots.   Soldiers need the ability to lie in a prone shooting position if there is no cover around them.  Grenades should show their possible throw arcs to make sure the path to the target is clear. One of my units tried to throw a grenade from a top of building down to the enemy from a crouching position. The grenade hit the wall right next to my unit and killed my unit. Lame. Grenades travel in upward arcs, not straight lines.  GOVERNMENT:  The governing screen that shows resources and the like is very confusing. I barely figured out how to buy new guns for my units. I don't know even what I CAN do in the govening screen!   There is more things wrong with this game but I still like the overall idea.   But it is NOT ready in order to be a popular and good game.  IT JUST NEEDS MORE CONTENT, A BETTER USER INTERFACE AND MORE POLISHING! ^_^ "
308420,Ziggurat, What if Binding of Isaac was in FIRST PERSON?  (and also had less grotesque bloody monsters and more fireballs)
308440,Pushcat,Fun and challenging little puzzle game.   Great to have running in the background during school.
308460,War in a Box: Paper Tanks,"This game is a very standard Tower Defence game. I found the setting and graphics enjoyable, but the game is very short. I passed it in 4,5 hours of play, or less. There is a hard mode, but I'm not interested in setting accomplishments. There were a few things I disliked. Sometimes, you are simply not given enough tower spaces. This makes gameplay more difficult as you are forced to shuffle turrets, depending on which enemy is incoming next wave. Contorls are ok, but sometimes tricky. It's definitely easier on tablet with 2 hands, rather than mouse with single pointer. But, it is ok with mouse too. Also, I just have to mention that I found the music very repetitive and kinda annoying. It is a consequence of this being a budget game... Overall, I can only recommend it on sale, due to low replayability. It has no endless modes either, just 24 levels. For a few hours of fun, though, it is ok!"

310360,Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi,I didn't realize how irritating the sound in this story was.
310370,The Way of Life Free Edition,"Sadly I have to change from recommended to not recommended.  I liked the Game alot in early Access, there was not much to play, but it made you think about how fast the world became and how we never think about how short Life is untill it's to late.   However, I expected alot of the Game, now, after it released... It's weird. It's not the game I expected or played in Early Access. I'm sad. The Game had potential, but this is just not the Game I had hoped to see.   4/10       Early Access Review:   6 Minutes that make you think about your life...   15/10"
310390,Advanced Tactics Gold,"This game has taken a while for me to get interested in it. Funny thing is, it reminds me a lot of the classic UNIX Empire game (see  wolfpackempire.com)  which was awesome, and very time consuming.  This game definitely gets a thumbs up and I hope I'm up to the challenge of being able to play it successfully."
310450,Steel & Steam: Episode 1,"  'Steel &amp; Steam: Episode 1' is not the worst game I've ever played - it's nowhere near. It has potential - the NPC interactions are all right and the overall design has some redeeming qualities. But it does lack many of the core features of a great game. The combat and battles are only a cheap copy from Pokemon with nothing but pressing enter repeatedly. The maps are too big and too full of useless terrain, and you never get to know the very characters you play with. Their names are the only thing you really get to know about them in the start. That really isn't enough when done the way this game does. Overall, it's something that could been a lot better of a game. But as it stands, it's not worth your time in the very competed 2D indie scene."
310460,Corto Maltese Secrets of Venice,"Unfortunately the game features a broken puzzle that will stop the player in his tracks about70% through. This puzzle entails mixing a medicine and it won`t work (having chekced walkthroughs and youtube I can attest to this) - hence fair warning to a prospective buyers. All of this is a shame, as the game atmosphere is quite good even if you are not a Venice lover or familiar with Hugo Pratt."
310470,Grand Ages: Medieval,"Dreadful, boring almost like a board game in electronic form. after 3 hours there is absolutely nothing to do. i left the game and made dinner and came back nothing had happened, to have that in the first day of game is dissapointing. to all those that are expecting to build an empire you wont, you have no control of buildings, locations or upgrading buildings with the exception of a few, you plop down a city, build a road which literally takes 3 seconds and set up a trader and thats it-done. now wait for 10 minutes and repeat. I peronally have had it Kalypso, i have wasted so much monry on their hit or miss products and this is definately a miss"
310490,Crookz - The Big Heist,"My choice for the hidden gem category!  And finally, a game that treats you like a grown up: You can save literally anywhere, as many times as you like. Its 'real-time with pause' gameplay allows you think your moves and lets you walk away to your fridge or pick up the phone, as you like.  The characters at some points may seem a bit cheesy, still all in all a well made 70s setting.  The gameplay is basically clicking paths for your different characters. Then at every node of that path you can attach one or multiple commands for the respective skill of the character, like putting down a guard or crawling through an air vent. So it's up to you, how you solve achieving the goal set out by your boss, like stealing a diamond or freeing your buddies from prison.  A great game! ...unfortunately it hasn't gotten the attention it deserves! Just watch the two trailer videos on the store page ;-)"
310510,Deathtrap,"This game is fun and addictive. Terribly so and you would have a great time. Initially. However, the bugs would get to you eventually and when you are three hours into a marathon killing session and yet one more bug crashes your game? Well, then it's just not that much fun anymore. Fortunately for me, these days the game won't even launch."
310560,DiRT Rally,"I really enjoy this game. I'm usually not into rally games, played colin mcRae on ps back in the days (with a controller) which was ok in that time and lately some dirt 3 complete which i didn't enjoy at all. this game here instantly hooked me tho and driving with a wheel feels like a natural experience, even with my old logitech momo one. great job devs! didn't test online yet, but even if it would be a mess, I wouldn't regret this purchase a single moment. "
310640,European Fishing,"This game is absolute RUBBISH. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. If you want a good fishing game, Buy Euro Fishing, thru Steam."
310700,Super Win the Game,"'Hey, remember Mario, Zelda II and Metroid?'  'Hell yeah I do. Those were great ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. What was that, 25 years ago? I love those games. Genre defining classics for sure.'  'Remember Super Win the Game?'  '...No.'"
310740,NEON STRUCT,"Great style, great stealth, great music."
310790,Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved,"I really do like this game (I even already have it on my Xbox 360), but there is a problem. The problem is: I can't have the 'detail' set at its max successfully without the visuals disappearing all the time. I can't see anything except the background; and I know that my gaming pc is more than capable of handling those graphics. Please help"
310810,Shiftlings,Nice looking game with intresting idea. Too bad the controls are so clunky.
310850,Onikira: Demon Killer,"The game is nice, when they keep up the good work it will be awesome. You have to fight smart, with different attacks and possibilities to counter the attacks, always beware. The level design is splendid, the music too. Become Jiro the demon Killer.

310890,Breach & Clear: Deadline Rebirth (2016),"The devs tried to aim for the moon but got burn by the sun. If only they stuck with the concept of the 1st game and just improved on that, but they had to stick zombies into it like a cookie cutter. The first game is better than door kickers but this is just a step back and it's no way worth the price. I don't care about them cutting mp, but by doing that they had kill any hopes of redeeming themselves. Buy it for 1 Peso"
310950,Street Fighter V,"Despite some of the launch shortcomings Street Fighter 5 is a step in the right direction.  The game play is closer to 3rd Strike, it feels snappier and more fun to play than SF 4.  Hopefully they continue to improve on the game.  **Update 12/21/2016**  The game has been out for a while now and I have to change my update from recommend to no.  Core game play is still lacking, online experience is really poor, and capcom doesn't seem to be fixing it."
310970,Legions of Ashworld,"Game looks good but I honestly can't understand what to do for the life of me. The tutorial just explained me the buttons and then I tried a real game, but was just killed in the first minute of walking around"
310990,Man in a Maze: Deathmatch,"TV show + stealth. Yep. This is it. 60 levels to beat. Bonus levels for completing objectives. You have to avoid lazers, robots, turrets and collect loot. Sometimes you just have to destroy all robots on map. You get spotted you may have luck running away, hiding or you will just die, so avoid detection. It's a sort of stealth game afterall. You have special skills and unlocks to them.  After beating a level you spin a wheel and get prize. Can you get them all? Yeah, the TV show serves as a background for more levels to beat.   Blah blah blah... I find hard to desribe this game properly. This game is uniqe to a degree (at least to me). It's about stealth and collecting stuff in first place. Nothing special - yep, possibly true, but I can tell is it's good at what it offers. Stop reading this and check the trailer. Game is fun and worth trying if you like stealthing a bit. Just don't blame me if you win a plunger :P"
311010,The Way,When the controls make the difficulty of the game it's time to rethink your design. What started as a promising Another World clone quickly turns into an exercise of frustration. Platforming is unbearable and the controls just hinder the experience. I played on both gamepad and mouse/keyboard and neither work well. Not reccomended.
311040,Rulers of Nations,"Better than the first edition but more diplomatic options would be fun, otherwise it's a great game and you should buy it."
311060,Battle Mages: Sign of Darkness,its a great game and i wish they make another battle mages game
311080,Echelon,"Horrendous experience, slight rant warning !  Was looking forward to some Nostalgia, to the good games of old, ...  But i tried as good as everything to get it to run on my Win7 64bit system, but never succesfull. I was even expecting that an oldy like this wouldn't run smoothly on newer systems (tends to happen, not first time, not first game)  But after going through this for an extended period of time, i'm throwing in the towel.  I would love if one of these (or both) would occur in the future:  1) devs should rlly ****ing update their games properly, so that they would/could actually run on more modern systems without too much hastle, if they want to sell their games via a Modern &amp; Digital retailer like Steam (or GoG or ....) The current situation just screws over clients, and its purely negative bussiness.  2) Valve should freaking atleast put a big warning about optimisation or compatability issues. Activly check the games they wish to sell via Steam, and put appropriate warnings in place.  And yeah i hear you, they do that already, but to such a lesser degree its laughable, and definitely not activly (enough) Way too many (older) games on Steam have issues with overlay, but Valve/Steam won't warn you about that, or that a game would, for a lot of players, not launch, or crash.  You only get that information from the other gamers that already smacked against that wall. Getting so darn sick of companies only purely after money &amp; power, abandoning decency whenever it suits em, and put a tiny freaking band-aid on gushing wounds as positive PR.   Now for the full experience, and the very near-future Refund ticket:   1) The game wouldn't launch, even after using admin + setting compatibility to win XP Service P3  2) after sifting through all guides and possible unofficial fixes and patches in the discussion section and online in general, I eventually got the game to launch to the main menu (sometimes), but that’s where it would crash again, or at other times I’d only have the option to 'Exit Game'.  Constantly trying to rewrite / patch the 'GameLauncher.bat' file, to force it to work as every guide / patch tries to do, yields varying results and error messages. But I never got to see or get to actually start the game from its main menu (if I even got to the main menu)  3)I’ve checked the Product Website, which yields nothing but generic game info, the Developer website is actually the Product Website, and the (supposed) Publisher, via the “Customer Support Website” doesn’t even have the game in its list of (supported) games. "
311100,Echelon: Wind Warriors,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  it is not recommended to buy this game with any windows versions XP and above. game is not optimalized for windows XP and above. game has buggs that will never be fixed. support doesnt speak english. 
311120,The Stalin Subway: Red Veil,"Either you liked or did not liked the 1st game (I liked it, despite it´s problems), I advice you to not buy this one. It was way shorter than the 1st one and the story is an ununderstandable mess. The performance was awfull and there were crashes all the time - for the 1st game, there is a fix online to improve it´s performance, but there is no fix for this one.  Even on 'easy', it appears I am playing on 'very hard' (and there is no 'very hard' difficulty). The enemy AI aimbots - a problem that existed in the last game, but in this one, it is even one bigger problem - the fact that you cannot lean in this game is what makes you die and die a lot of times, so the most important way to win the game is to Fast Save almost all the time after a firefight (F5 key). Also, why isn´t the music enabled when you play for the 1st time, forcing the player to enable it? Despite that, both the menu music and the in-game music are trash compared to the 1st game.  When we look at both of this games, we see again the dialectics in motion, according to Marxist theory, which Stalin himself wrote about ('Dialectical and Historical Materialism'). Stalin Subway is the thesis and Stalin Subway: The Red Veil is the anthesis - but will we have a synthesis? Only time will tell, but me liking the 1st game, I think we need a 'Stalin Subway 3' (or a remake) to restore greatness to the series and fix the problems from the 2 games.  In conclusion: do not buy it, even on special sale period. Just get the 1st one.  "
311140,The Stalin Subway,"Pure old school FPS. Has autosave, manual save and QS. Love this old style type FPS. Had a blast. So much better than what passes for most FPS's these days. Many of which are defiled with RPG level up elements or all graphics or story and the game play sucks. No hand holding. No limited weapons slots. Enemies use decent cover tactics some refusing to foolishly come out . Progress requires paying attention to your enviroments. Sometimes the way out of a situation is concealled . Nothing a little looking around won't fix."

311240,Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma,"I've been a big fan of the Zero Escape Series for a long time, so when I finally got this game, I was ecstatic. Problem is, at least the pc version, it's unpolished as all heck.  The game feels like a long movie, in previous titles in this series, we could press a button and speed up the dialouge, but in this game we don't have that luxury. We are forced to slowly watch the same things over and over with cutscenes that look like garbage and voice acting that could be... better.  There are bugs everywhere, and for whatever reason, there is no keyboard functionality. It seems they got rid of it so you have the option to use a controller.  To be honest the story isn't that bad though, Which is what the game is about. The stories in the Zero Escape games have all been brilliant, however this one feels lacking as we know a lot about the universe from previous games and it kills a lot of the mystery that benefitted the games before.  All in all. It's a shame I can't beat the game.  You see, I encountered a game breaking bug that completely and utterly ruined my experience, I'd start a new file, however, as mentioned above, I would have to watch everything all over again (which I don't want to do).  I've tried contacting Chunsoft multiple ways to see if they would do something but they never responded. The game's story is good, the game overall, is bad.  If you want to experience this game, just wait till your favorite youtube let's player plays it so you don't have to suffer through the game itself and you can enjoy the story."
311250,Doorways: The Underworld,THATS MY GAME :)
311310,Naval Action, Early Access Review
311340,METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"There are many things you could buy for $20 that are signifigantly better overall experiences, however, this mission is pretty great and a valuable prologue to Phantom Pain. I can ONLY recommend you get it as part of the Definitive edition bundle, as it comes packaged with Phantom Pain and all the DLC, AND it's the same price as Phantom Pain, so there's literally no reason not to buy it that way."
311400,OCEAN CITY RACING: Redux,"I don't like it, waste of money.. the graphics aren't great.. the controls awful.. that car is sliding all over the place like it's on ice.."
311480,Vertical Drop Heroes HD,"I love the concept of this game. The characters are cute, the gameplay isn't overloaded with gore, and there are some fun puzzlesolving elements at play that can prove quite challenging the further you progress in your playthrough. In the end, after you finally accomplish a goal, you do feel a sense of accomplishment in it. The skills arsenal of skills were everywhere from whacky to straightforward, and hilarious. Sometimes the deaths felt cheap but death in the gamed nevered proved to be much of a setback, and while this game isn't centered around lore, it still presented many hours of almost arcade-like enjoyment."
311490,Spirit Run - Fire vs. Ice,"I had fun with this game as I bought it in a bundle online for a cheap price, and found it mildly enjoyable with a 'meh' soundtrack. However, collisions are a little iffy but shouldnt be too much of a problem if you're precise enough.  The price is a little steep for a game of this caliber in my opinion, but if it looks good to you I'd recommend buying it.  (Side note: as mentioned in other reviews, this seems like a fun game to play with a couple of friends, too.)"
311560,Assassin's Creed Rogue,"just play black flag, it was less buggy"
311680,Flower Shop: Winter In Fairbrook,"Pretty boring. The plant minigame is kinda fun, but the plot is very simple and not very interesting."
311690,Enter the Gungeon,"If you love games like binding of isaac, and you think to buy this game, buy it If you have a doubt, buy and thanks me later :)"
31170,Tales of Monkey Island: Chapter 1 - Launch of the Screaming Narwhal,Great game
311720,Sproggiwood,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
311730,Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,Cons: Controls are a little awkward (pressing the control stick to pause)  Online is pretty much dead.  DLC up the bunghole.  Pros: Boobs.
311770,LEGO® Pirates of the Caribbean The Video Game,"I love this game, i really do, but i played it in on console, right now this steam version of the game (At least in windows 7 and 8) it crashing a lot, i barely can play 10 mins before it crashes and there is no way to save, so sad. Not recomended so far, until devs fix it."
31180,Tales of Monkey Island: Chapter 2 - The Siege of Spinner Cay ,  slow and dull
311800,Black Ice, Early Access Review
311820,RC Mini Racers,"Decent enough, but the fact you have to pass through very specific areas makes shortcuts, and cool bits of gameplay almost pointless. If the game had looser checkpoints, this would be a great game"
311840,Wildlife Park,Was really bummed that Zoo Tycoon hasn't made it to Steam yet so this is a very close second.
311850,Zombie Solitaire,"There are no resolution options; you can't open in windowed mode, only fullscreen. Has a fatal glitch involving the fullscreen display. When you can see the game runnning, the display is tiny, and fixed in the upper corner of the screen. It also cuts off much of what you should be seeing which means you can't see important bits of the UI. When you run the game in other compatibility modes, you can't see the game running at all. There's no way around this glitch. You'll find reports of it in the community discussions. If support were coming, that would be one thing, but there has never been an update to this game, and there likely never will be one. This glitch obviously doesn't affect everyone, but I can only speak to my own expereinces. Based on that, I can't recommend the game in case you end up in the same boat I'm in: having bought an unplayable game."
311860,Data Hacker: Initiation,Looks like a rushed game with an uncompelling story. Boring and repetitive combat.
311870,Super Trench Attack!,"This is a great game, dont doubt that at all. great story line, average graphics FOR ITS TYPE OF GAME. the reason i cant recommend this is because once you get up to around the 4th level and you gotta kill the admiral (leader), its litterally taken about 17 tries. Now this personally this could just me since im new and don't have such a trigger-happy attitude for the fighting. also, its actually pretty difficult to get the gold in order to pay for ammo, grenades, med packs, decoys, or even new guns. I would say though if you got skill, this is a good game and you should get it, but if your a little slow on clickin for shootin, be careful... =P enjoy"
31190,Tales of Monkey Island: Chapter 3 - Lair of the Leviathan ,"In the first two episodes, I spent a lot of time in frustrated wandering. There was a little frustrated wandering in this episode, but not much. This is the first episode I was able to complete without resorting to looking online, and I enjoyed it much more for that reason. I don't know if I just got better at the game, or if it was the game itself."
311910,DIG IT! - A Digger Simulator,good game but i wish they would support dual joystick controlls like t.16000m joysticks and attack 3's etc
311930,Tinertia,"Great platformer. The controls were hard to get used to (harder than with plague knight in plague of shadows), but it is just as fun. It's great when you become capable of tackling those complex levels on your first try. The idea behind have no jump button was great, the mechanics of the game were very well thought, and about the graphics/environment it is all great aswell."
311980,Isomer, Early Access Review
31200,Tales of Monkey Island: Chapter 4 - The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood ,"Do you like best of CD´s?  Well if you do you´re in for a treat...  Cuz this will be your The BEST of Monkey Island series collection. It features a rather bland story with not that cleverly designed puzzles and a lot of things you´ve already seen, waterd down jokes and a plot twist that is just uninspired. I got really disapointed by this fanmade game. Because that´s what this game is, a game made by fans.  It´s not as bad as 'Escape from Monkey Island' though, thank god for that!"
312010,Bird Assassin,Do not buy this game unless its on sale for $0.50 or less. It took me only an hour and a few minutes to beat this game and buy everything there is in the shop. There is an EXTREMELY small amount of courses and its just not fun.
312020,Bounders and Cads,"Fun board game, reminds me a little of a European Monopoly. I enjoy board games, so for me it's a winner. Great price too!"
312050,Red Johnson's Chronicles - 1+2 - Steam Special Edition,"Got 10 minutes into the game and coudlnt continue, really annoyed that i paid for this.   There are no options to change graphics settings your stuck with what they give you, you cant rebind the keys and the game seems to have alot of quick time events. Id give this game a pass or wait till its on sale."
31210,Tales of Monkey Island: Chapter 5 - Rise of the Pirate God,"Well, all I can say about this chapter is that you have to play through it to complete the game...  Otherwise, is just a piece of junk filled with the developers' bad jokes.  At the end, this game is 2/5: Only 2 chapters are great, chapter 3, 4, 5 are just a waste."
312150,Wild Warfare, Early Access Review
31220,Sam & Max 301: The Penal Zone,I love Sam and Max! XD Nice game!
312210,The Fifth Day, Early Access Review
312220,Tales of Adventure 2,"This game is terrible for the price. If you can click the mouse, then you can beat it. 'Adventure' is barely the word I would use to describe this game. I would pay $1 for it to kill time, but $10 retail is disgusting."
312230,Spirits of Xanadu,the best
312240,SEAL Team 12,this game sucks waste of $3 it makes the protagonist GOD like of all names this is the most aethiest game evar
312270,Siege of Inaolia, Early Access Review
312280,Simply Chess,"The most perfect game ever created, simple and simultaneously complex."
31230,Sam & Max 302: The Tomb of Sammun-Mak,"hit a bug, wasted 1 hour after 3 hours of playing...this is not a new game, these kind of things should not exist"
312300,Heroes Rise: HeroFall,"THIS! Now this was an awesome way to wrap up the Heroes Rise trilogy. I was enthralled from beginning to end. Twists and turns appeared in this story that I wouldn't have ever expected from the first story, second one, or even the beginning here. Lots of deep and thought provoking action. Every choice truly mattered, and you could save or destroy your entire story with one awesome or terrible decision. I would strongly recommend this story, and the rest of its trilogy, to anyone looking for a good choice based read. Easy 10/10."
312310,Ensign-1, Early Access Review
312350,Commander : The Great War,Its next to impssible to win any battle even if your entrenched utter ♥♥♥♥♥ i want my money back
312360,To End All Wars,"You can pick different war plans before the war starts, try your best to gain new allies, its a hard game but man its fun to play. :D"
312370,"Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon",I like the game but the constant crash's from acces violation bugs is going too far it's been going on since launch patch and fix it and i might change to a yes
31240,Sam & Max 303: They Stole Max's Brain!,A funny point &amp; click adventure
312410,Defense Zone,"To me this was one the best tower defense games out for the price, it gets tougher as you go along but allows you to learn and make it through each level. If you are into tower defense games I'd say buy it, you'll love it."
312420,Hell,I had MASSIVE enthusiasm for this game but it was a let down in all departments.
312440,Legions of Steel,Love the game its just very buggy!
312450,Order of Battle: World War II,"Not a bad game for turn-based strategy, can't wait for the European game to come out soon"
312510,Mega Coin Squad,"all the sudden there's more local multiplayer games than i have time for...i think this one is one of the best. if you liked duck game, but found yourself wishing you could cause your opponents to lose their money and also steal money from them, then this."
312530,Duck Game,"As the great Vinny says, sometimes I just like to shoooooooooot, but most importantly remember to quack, you may not understand now, but In order to achieve victory thou must quack"
312560,Xanadu Next,"Terrible port for the PC.The game seems to be very good and probably is, if you can play it.Both the xbox and ps4 controllers do not work well.It is impossible for me to buy many things from the merchants because I can´t change the category of what he is buying.For example:If I am looking at weapons and want to see armor When i move the controller or mouse to change for armor the game crashes.When I am looking at potions , and want to change for keys , the game crashes.Very unstable and poor executed.Maybe in a month or 2 the game will be playable.It is very sad , because it does seem to be an amazing game."
31260,Sam & Max 305: The City that Dares not Sleep,just as good as the other Episodes (played in offlinemode)
312600,Rime Berta,"For some reason it reminds me a lot of the N64/PS1/old school games. It's a chill game, always make me cheerful but it also don't overload you with information, instead, it introduce to you things little by little and let you learn on your own, which is very good for one side, but I miss a 'encyclopedia' or something like it, just to be sure if I got it correctly. The music is very peaceful and fits wonderfully the whole game. About the gameplay, it's looks not so in deep like other tactical games, like FFT or Xcom, BUT, it has some very fresh ideas, like the counter and skill system which I appreatiate a lot! My only real complain is that the camera movement is a little odd to control and because it does not have a encyclopedia/tutorial (at least not that I know) I'm still unsure of how everything works! To sum it up, if you like tactical games and would like to play something new, give this a try! You won't regret! :D"
312610,METAL SLUG X,"Controls are sloppy. It simply doesn't play well enough to do what's expected of you in game. Be read to die A LOT, because your guy didn't jump when you pressed the button or wouldn't turn the f*ck around to shoot something coming at you from the other direction. This goes for all these METAL SLUG games. I bought the pack on a steam deal and they all play like crap."
312630,OTTTD,"This is clearly a port from some mobile platform. And really bad port at that. You can't even scroll the screen by moving te mouse to the side of the screen. Like, sireously? Even if it were a decent port, the game itself is still pretty 'meh'."
312640,Power-Up,it's cool
31270,Puzzle Agent,Although this is a good game i would advise you not to play this game to be honest for the $4.99 you sunk into this you get a often times agrivatingly easy/hard ( yes i said easy ) With some of them making some sense like ' oh hey you gotta do this this and this never diverge from that ' so you're like okay ' oh yea btw i'm gunna be a specific ♥♥♥♥♥ so if i don't like it even if it's right under my rules you're ♥♥♥♥ing wrong 'That is what the puzzles are like some are even so easy you wonder why they put them into the game like ' okay just..... * Smokes weed * j-just throw ♥♥♥♥ around until they snap together maaaan ' and it's in one of the FINAL PUZZLES! YES YOU HEARD ME ONE OF THE FINAL PUZZLES IS SO EASY infact all of the final puzzles are so simple a todler could finish 90% of them. And while the red guys had some shrowd of mystery on me they where just a jumpscare exscue or to pad out the game length and also these guys are foes and they help you in one of the final puzzles.....H-How can you be that backwards to ♥♥♥♥ing with this guy not wanting him to get to this other guy and then just beeing like ' oh hey you need that LemmeJustGiveThatToYou.  All and all this rant if you couldn't understand hopefuly conveys the message of buysing something better than THIS steaming pile of crap
312720,Khet 2.0,"Edit: The Devs are very active on thier forums and have even replied to this review. Good on them! I cant wait til they fix it later this week. I changed my review from a no to a yes. Devs like this should be rewarded.  I have played a handful of games of this... This is based off of a classic board game so it would be kinda hard to screw it up.  Unless of course it crashes after every game. Which it does. I mean I got this on sale but it should still work, right?  If the crashing gets fixed this game would be perfect."
312750,Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake),"The UI is not so great, but this is a great port of the DS version with updated resolution and sound. If you want the traditional 2D experience, look elsewhere, but the 3D visuals and cutscenes puts this version over the top for me."
312780,Way of the Samurai 4,Only game on steam where you can have sex with  underage  british loli consul or 86 year old grandma.
312790,Agarest: Generations of War 2,"Yeah I picked up this game only because I wanted to see if it was as bad as so many people have placed it.  BLUF: (Bottom line up front) The first game was the hight of this series, even zero was a pale comparison to it  It is! In its defence it would have been better if it was a spin off.  -The continents are so strange you can't place what one is what unless you memorized the names. -The Cast is so bad that you won't even be mad anymore that you have 2 less people in your party -The spell lists and books seem like a cool way to specialize your party, but both the skills given and the powers you recieve are worthless once you get the power of Arc-An-Ciel (AAC) -The main story is so pathedic that you mainly just use skip in order to get to the next crapy battle  The good parts of the game are very few -All party members get exp now, so no longer will you have a party member under leveled at a special battle that only they are in (which is also gone) -Battles are faster (if you didn't use auto battle for easy fights in the first two) -You can change your party mid battle (This one was actualy amazing)  Neutral parts of the game (good/bad depending on player) - No longer are your weapons key points of skills you can have, now it is only better stats. making end game items no longer character specific - Flashy combos are replaced with finnishing moves (no AP required, just tokens you get for break gage) allowing for quicker flow, and the ability to use multiple times in combat (even more then once on one foe) - Mini game added to agument relationships (good for those that want to experience a different story options but still want to keep brides happy to pick them at end of generations)  Worst part of battles in this game, is that you had to specialize your characters so much in atks (one char had only holy atks ect) in order to take advantage of weaknesses cause of the crapy rotation skills. But with the low skill count in thsi game for a large portion of it made it worthless once you started to get enough for specializing (See AAC)  I did drop this game due to lack of interest, and just watched a speed up 'lets play' in order to see what I missed (which was my time and money)  WORST PART OF THE GAME IS THE DEMAND FOR MINI GAMES! and it was made for a controler or motion control. so the port to the computer was bad for adjusting for true ends.  I believe that games like this, that abandon all the qualities that makes a game great and unique, end up killing otherwise worthly franchises.  Final review: Only get this game if you A)Didn't enjoy the battle system of the prior ones B)Didn't enjoy the fact that wrong decitions in the story could prevent you from choosing a bride at end of generations C)you REALLY want to see a sequil (oh wait japan companies dont care about us, so I guess a port when/if they make one?)"
31280,Poker Night at the Inventory,"Fun game, I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad, all-in-all, great game!"
312840,Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered,"A QTE (quick time events) MESS. this game is riddled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ QTE'S that ruin the game including this fight with a robed guy that went dragonball z, which ruined my experience with the game. if you love qte's then you'll like it, if not you'll get annoyed. i'm stuck with the robed guy because somehow i messed up with the button mashing qte where you keep pressing A and D to keep the power bar up to prevent the robed guy from killing you but somehow i 'failed' it. i give up on the game, what were the devs thinking? i think the qte events are bugged to hell that pisses me off, i swear that i almost bashed my keyboard out of anger, if you have anger issues DON'T BUY IT.   I forgot to mention the good. stupid qte's. interesting story, (for now) characters have an emotional bar where if the character you're playing as did something that can affect their mood, the more sad the character gets, emotion health bar deteriorates, or the most happy the character gets, emotion health bar increases. if the emotion bar completely deteriorates then your character (I'm currently playing the accused murderer) ends the game automatically, example, the accused murderer turns himslef to the police if his mental health bar is depleted. I don't know about the other characters you play as."
31290,Back to the Future: Ep 1 - It's About Time,"If you liked the movies, and don't loathe point and click adventures, you'll most probably like this. It's a perfect sequel to the original trilogy! :)"
312900,Zoo Rampage,"If you wanna become a Zookeeper then here's your chance to see how hard it is to stop ragin' animals.. you'll never wanna become one then, problem solved.  God damn that Zombie Giraffe."
312920,Rugby League Live 3,"A very nicely made game. I also have Don Bradman Cricket 14, and i have to say Big Ant are very good at making sports games. Both games are amazing representations of their sports.   I recommend playing career mode at first, and maybe try a few positions (muliple careers). Once you understand the buttons and roles of each position, you will be better at running the whole team at once.   If you want to goal kick play no.4. I play fullback and its a nice way to play it, coz you are always behind the play in defence and attack, which is the best view, and you can inject yourself as you please tackling or attacking. Just remember to drop back for the kick on the last tackle!  The AI range from stupid to very good and hard. Depends on the skill level. On the lowest they might run away from you instead of tackle you a lot, 1 good fend you are through the line. Amateur (next level up) is a nice level, they are smarter but not impossible to get through while you are low skills. Pro and above, you need to build up your skills first or you wont get through their defence. Yes, you can change skill levels any time during your career.  I dont rate people's opinions when they have only played for a few hours. or if they trash the game because they didnt read it needed a controller to play.  If you wont go out and buy a controller to experience this game its your loss. I strongly recommend an XBox controller. The game's controller setup is XBox by default. Works lovely if you have the controller. All XBox controllers i know of work on PCs too. TBH i cant imagine wanting to play it without an XBox controller on a PC. These days you need a controller for pretty much any sports games. If you dont want to buy a controller, dont buy sports games. They would be crap to play on a keyboard i reckon.  Its an awesome game and the best NRL game ive seen to date. It is immersive, addictive and very well done. People who rate it down are either too stingy to buy a controller, tried playing pro on thier first game and just werent anywhere near up to it (and it made them sad), or tried the lowest skill level which is ridiculously easy and the AI do more stupid stuff.   Highly recommended for NRL fans."
312960,Starion Tactics,I played only SP mode and I can say it's Intresting game.
312970,My Ex-Boyfriend the Space Tyrant,"This game made me laugh a whole bunch, and the aesthetic is great. Very kitschy, but also does a decent job of capturing the 90s point-and-click adventure game style; a lot of the humor feels in the same vein, but with a gay twist.   It's got some issues; make sure to save often, because sometimes the game will crash. You can double-click when moving to a new screen to skip the often long walking animations.   On the whole, this game was worth playing, and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel."
312980,Graviteam Tactics: Mius-Front,This game sucks. I thought this game will look like Warthunder BUT NO its a stupid commanding tanking game.
312990,The Expendabros,"It's a good game you can finish it in 30 minutes, it's fun to play I recomend."
3130,Men of War: Red Tide,As of writing this review I only have 6.8 hours into the game and I want to play many more hours. The game can be difficult and frustrating (even on easy) but it adds to the fun of the game. You have to plan your every move and come up with a strategy to complete objectives and one wrong move could end up in failing the mission or one of your units being wiped out. The enemies are positioned in ways that make it next to impossible to just rush in guns blazing. In many missions the odds are stacked against you and you have to do your very best to make sure you don't lose many troops.   Now the game isn't without faults. Sometimes your units will get stuck on walls or something when you go to move them or they'll move right out into the open and get gunned down. There's been a few times where I've had units get gunned down despite the fact that they should have been out of enemy sight. And then there's the occassional times where your troops will not fire at enemies even though they may be set to 'Fire at Will' or 'Return Fire'. But these issues don't happen often enough for them to become major issues that ruin the game.   If you like strategy games that give you a challenge this game is definitely for you. There are very few strategy games I've played that have given me such a challenge and sense of accomplishment when I complete missions and I strongly recommend this game.
31300,Tunnel Rats 1968,this game made me poop out my guts
313010,Cities XXL,"I do not recommend it even being a fan of the original version of this game. To be honest, it still give me a sense that it is just an enhancement version of the cities xl. If you compare this game to every generation of this series, the only thing changed is just the interface. This game is actually the first version. I cannot even call it a remastered version. Relentlessly, this game has not achieved even a half of what the cities skylines has achieved. And such tiny improvement can be brought by a simple mod. For example, it is the 5th generation of this series and it still not optimized to multi-core. When the other developers start to pursue, is it the time to make some essential changes? I just want to ask the developers: Will the extraordinary feeling brought by the first version show up again? Trust me: refund it and have a skylines while you can"
313020,Soul Gambler,Cute story/novel game I picked up during the winter sale. It's fun to puzzle for the achievements. If you aren't into getting all of those this game might be to short for you.  I do wish I could click a bit quicker through some of the conversations (mostly the one with the smoking man) after the first playthrough.
313040,Pixel Hunter,YOU CANT... SHOOT... THE GOD DAMN RABBITS
313080,The Masterplan,Nice little game. Sometimes challenging and you have to plan your approach well. Reminds me of 90's games. If you can get it cheap go for it.
313120,Stranded Deep, Early Access Review
313130,Metrocide,"* Don't bother, even if it's on sale! *  I am all about the cyper-punk-noir art style and feel of the game, but it has serious issues:  - it is extremely poorly made; it tends to crash for no apprent reason, and the menu selection is not intuitive. For instance, if you select 'Full-Screen without also adjusting the resolution the game will run in the background without you being able to see it to make further adjustments - if you don't like a merciless trial-and-error process of figuring out a game, you'll probably just get frustrated, and quickly - the difficulty curve is bananas; - the unlock system really needs to be more transparent; - there should be an option to re-map keys; - there aren't even volume controls; - the game continues around you while you're locked in the shop/contract menus;   Beyond the issues with the mechanics, the game tends to crash from time to time, which is all the more annoying when it takes 25 minutes to take out 5 contracts. When autosaving doesn't work with the gameplay, you'd sure as hell better guarantee that you've got all stability issues covered. It doesn't matter how much you like the game when it works; when you've finally saved up enough cash for a Skycleaner and a Silenced Shotgun, and the game locks up upon leaving the shop menu, you're going to spam Ctrl+Alt+Del to get out, and write a review about the issues...  I'd previously said that 'I would really like to recommend this game, but I don't want to have the conversation about the prerequisite mindset necessary to actually enjoy playing it,' but that was when I thought it was a game. After trying time and again to try to either have fun or make progress in this accursed experience, I finally realized that it was actually a frustration generator disguised as a game, and were this available in a physical form, it too might end up in a landfill to be dug up by kids from the next generation who had heard the legend of the program that ruined many a space bar, and almost succeeded in breaking the human spirit before the coming Computer Wars.  'Delete Local Content'?  Yes, please!"
313140,Blackbay Asylum,"When I first hear of Blackbay Asylum I immediately got interested, despite not being a fun of puzzles, but a gore and insane-related stuff lover. The game is very interesting and catchy, with a psycho killer who has to explore an asylum to get out from and realizes that something there isn't right: monsters, dead bodies everywhere and a terrible truth to discover. Puzzles are the main part of this game: in order to continue your adventure you have to explore the place and resolve these puzzles; some of them are very easy, while others apparently look difficult, but once you realize how simple these lasts are, you can beat the game with no problems. And the diary helps you with them. The gore is also an another element that impressed me a lot, despite the simplicity of the graphic, mostly when I played in first/person mode (and Chapter 3 scaried me a lot, just to say). And I kinda liked it.  At the end I really enjoyed the game and I would suggest it to puzzle and gore lovers."

313190,Pacific Liberation Force,"The story is not very original at all, flight physics are awful and you only get about an hour of gameplay out of this game. I found it to be unplayable with a joystick because there are no dead zone settings and the helicopter is extremely twitchy (at least with my joystick)."
313200,The Abbey,"Visuals, story, characters and voice acting are all very good, game is certanly memorable in that regard, but two fings are stopping me from recomending it: 1. Missing assets bug, game will crash at certain spots and you will be forced to manualy rename incorrectly named files. 2. Puzzles are mostly fine, but often they are solved by visiting all locations to see if something changed since your last visit or talking to all characters for new dialog option. It becomes tedious realy fast (especialy if you now game can crash on you at any point and force you to repeat all that one again)  My advice: if you are interested in this game - just watch a walkthrough on youtube, you'll get everything that's good about this game and save yourself a lot of frustration"
313210,Alpha Zylon,"This game is so horribly bad, but I bought it during the Steam Winter Sales for NZ89c because penguinz0 (Cr1tiKal) played this game. Cr1tiKal is a YouTuber that loves bad games and I want a little collection of really bad games myself. Perhaps one day they'll come in handy? Only buy this as a joke or send it to someone you don't like as a big f*** you gift."

This is a game that I've been waiting for and while I wish it had been released as a whole package, what I've played so far was fun."

313590,Boo Bunny Plague,It's an ok game but the only really good thing about it is the music. The combat is very basic(melee swing only) and the voice acting is so so. The worst part is the game does not alt tab well at all and I could not open the game again which lost my save as there is no auto save and I didn't think to save when alt tabbing.

313690,LEGO® Batman™ 3: Beyond Gotham,"This might be my new favorite of the Lego games. Star Wars III might still be a technically better game, thanks to those RTS-like zones, but this one had a lot of good things going for it. And a lot of bad things, glitches etc., that particularly show up in the late game. However, this one's got a new story, focusing more on Braniac and the various Lantern Corps, with a good bit of the classic Lego game humor, and a whole lot of homages. And it's those homages that put this game over the edge for me. Superman and Wonder Woman play their classic theme music when flying around, there's a secret level based on the 1966 Adam West show, complete with the sound effect cards when you hit things, and the usual assortment of DC characters ranging from classics to obscure. All in all, a very fun game, one that I'm actually pondering picking up the DLC for. It has provided enough hours of entertainment to justify it, and hey, more fun could be had that way."

You have to sit through to stupid intro story each time you try to which is a waste of time.   DONT BY THIS GAME  Also no controller support on a metroidvania game is horrible.
313980,Proxy Blade Zero,This game is way better than it looks. I have played this for much longer than steam says I have and i've enjoyed it all. Very hard rewarding combat and nothing else. 100% pure.

Not recommended cuz savage."
314120,Frayed Knights: The Skull of S'makh-Daon,"10 scale: Graphics: 4 Music: 5 Fun: 7 Story: 7 Value: 7  Frayed Knights is a party-based first-person POV RPG. Similar to games such as WIzardry, Eye of the Beholder, etc. The story is decent, creating the desire to move ahead and figure out the mysteries of what is going on. One feature of the game is the witty banter between party members. The game focus on a being lighthearted and witty. The biggest negative is the graphics. They would be at home with games from 10-15 years ago. But the gameplay and story make up for that deficiency. Leveling up is rewarding, with many spells, abilities and bonuses to choose from.   Loot was sufficient, but barely. Around 95% of loot is white junk that you sell for a bit of coin. When you do find a 'legendary' item, it is a big deal, so don't expect wondrous loot to rain down from the heavens. Fights start out very slow, until you get some abilities and spells under your belt. Exploration is fun. There are some decent puzzles, but nothing that is too difficult (I'm not a puzzle-man myself, so one or two here and there is fine).   One of the biggest pitfalls is load times. I have the game installed on an SSD and load time between zones is around 25-30 seconds. Fortunately, you won't be reloading or zoning very often. The game has a system where you build up stars that give great bonus abilities as long as you don't reload the game or die. Abilities like giving a character full health or resurrecting a character. Unfortunately, my party got stuck in several places, hung up on the geomtry of the game world, unable to move, so I had to reload and lose my stars a few times, but you rebuild stars pretty fast. Other than that, the game never crashed and I ran into virtually no other bugs.   My final gripe is the mapping system. Auto-mapping is available, and it works great. However, if you zone, you lose the map to that zone. Not sure why the maps don't save, but once you explore a zone, you most likely won't need the map anyhow, so it's a minor annoyance.   All-in-all, if you like party-based rpg games and can put up with a game that feels old-school, I think this is a pretty good game. I give it a total of 6.5 out of 10, and I feel like I got my money and time's worth out of it."
314150,Double Dragon Trilogy,"The first two games are still solid action games, but I recommend bringing a friend because they get tough fairly quickly. The third game is absolute crap and should be avoided unless you're just looking to rack up some achievements."
314160,Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition,"Good game, but I can't see my mouse in the game."
314180,Deathsmiles,"probably the most beautiful bullet hell i've played, and relatively easy enough for those new to (or, in my case) bad at the genre"
314200,Bionic Heart,"I cannot recommend this one. Other games by this publisher are B-grade campy fun, but this one has the most juvenile, flat writing and a depressing tone that just makes one sad. Also, a single run is extremely short. It's meant to be played over and over to see different endings, but the characters and setting are not well-defined enough for this to involve any nuance. You can play it over and over, but your only reward will be to see all the text. It won't really feel like a valid story.   Also, what's with the art? The Art Rules: 'Your face must be so clearly deliniated from your neck as to look like your chin is the edge of a chasm. Also, your neck tendons are the most important feature of your body. We need to really, really emphasize those. And don't forget to wax and buff your boobs to a gleaming shine!' ???"
314210,Tesla Breaks the World!,"I was excited to get this game when I found it but much to my bitter disappointment, no matter what I do, I cannot fire one of those hover car things on level one, I have tried every button, installed and uninstalled the game and nothing....sorry but I do not reccommend this one"
314220,Bombing Bastards,Unfairly difficult (single player). I have no idea what the devs were thinking. I cannot even finish the 2nd world. Each NPC in the map will 'play' like the most tactical p*ssy ever. The biggest design problem is that enemies literally STOP and basically camp and hide behind the cover. It's extremely difficult to kill them even if you have multiple remote-detonating bombs. Now THAT is messed up. They actively going around to get you and the power up too. It's like playing with 8 really good humans who you have to eliminate in 5 minutes. It's nearly impossible.

314250,Jet Gunner,"I born in 84 and I grew up in the late 80s and 90s. I know what classic games really look like. Beside playing any NES games, I want any new games that have not release in NES console and I don't want to hook up NES console. I was in the mood to play any hardcore 8-bit game in modern day and found this game. This is excatly what I am looking for! I am glad this day and age the 8-bit games still alive and kicking! It made me feel like I am back in the 90s! If you miss 8-bit game with any kind of genres but don't want to play any on NES? This is for you. Not just for classic gamers, but also for any who willing to play hard games and have mindset to beat this game, then it for you!  I recommend controller pad call 'NES30'  http://www.nes30.com/  and I also use software call JoyToKey."

314340,Chess 2: The Sequel,"I would like a simply game of chess, but this game have their own rules and even in the classic mode also. If you are looking for a new experience this is your game, but if you are looking for a normal game of chess, you must look for other game of chess, for example Battle vs Chess."
314360,Aritana and the Harpy's Feather,"  I haven't played much into this game, but based on what I've played, it really is a great game and worth it's price. It reminds me a lot of Donkey Kong Country ( a mix between the SNES classics and the new ones) and honestly, my opinion might change the further I delve into the game, but so far, it has been just as good as playing DKC. Note: I got it in a bundle that I bought mostly for Chroma Squad, yet this game that I had never heard of seems to outshine every other.  Why you should buy it: -If you like Donkey Kong Country you will surely like this -Very good platforming experience with decently challenging levels -Intersting mechanics with the stance changes and the stuff you learn along the way -A good entry on a genre that is generally very lacking when it comes to PC gaming -Except for the menus, the game has pretty good graphics and design  The only downsides I can see for this game (considering I have the DLC and haven't played without it) -Poor optimization, so when starting levels on max graphics it has low fps for some time, then it fixes itself (my pc is not top of the line but definetly good, runs Overwatch on Ultra 60fps) -It involves a lot of brazilian indigenous culture, so someone from another country might not apreciate it.

314380,Lantern Forge,"This game feels unfinished, it's rough, needs much polishing and fleshing out... Which is a shame, it had such potential.

Don't get ripped off from this abandonware like I did, find something else to play."

314510,Fall of the New Age Premium Edition,"Fall of the New Age is an adventure puzzle game set in the early Renaissance period where the pursuit of knowledge and application of logic are emerging as the way forward. You play as a young thief on a mission to save her brother from a nefarious cult whose ultimate goal is to halt this progress and return the world to one steeped in ignorance and superstition. You are aided in your mission by a mysterious stranger who is working against the cult. Unfortunately it doesn't get much deeper than this, but then it is a quick and casual game.  With regards to actual gameplay, Fall of the New Age is part adventure, part hidden object game. You will search beautifully painted scenes for objects to solve puzzles and progress the story/access new areas. There are a number of minigames throughout to break things up a bit/add some variety, and there are cutscenes as you transition from one area to the next to help progress the story.  I enjoyed Fall of the New Age for the most part - as others have said, it's a good game to play if you want some game time but don't want to play anything particularly taxing. The artwork is lovely, as is the music. The story is.. somewhat lacking, but there at least. The puzzles themselves shouldn't give you too much grief. Overall, it was an enjoyable way to spend a handful of hours. If you're a fan of hidden object games (or not averse to them and looking for a casual game to add to your library for some gaming down time), then I'd recommend Fall of the New Age. It's not amazing, but it's not bad either.  (I received this in a steamcrate bundle ..and left it open for an hour or so while preparing dinner.)"
314520,Euro Fishing,"Best Fishing Game I have played in a long time  So let me say that this is one of the best fishing games I have played in a long time. The game has issues. Hopefully they can fix them. So if it has issues then why is it the best I've played in a long time?  That would be because fishing games aren't made often and when they are they are very arcade now. No multiplayer and no tournaments for multiplayer. So what about this game? Okay I'll tell you the goods and bads and leave it at that.  The goods-  -Good looking Environment. This includes the water. I have mine set to highest setting and the water looks great. -Fish graphics are really great. Fish look very real and are done very well -Fish are swimming in the water you are fishing in. Yup there are fishing swimming around that you have to hope come across your bait. The most I went without a bite was 20 minutes, but its also because I didn't move. It's not arcade feeling and feels like real fishing because of waiting longer times sometimes than others. -This is Euro fishing. I did't think I would like it because I like to bass fish and such, but I was really wrong. Catching fish off a peg is great. You put your rods in the pegs and wait and then hear your line screaming and the peg screaming too. It can be intense sometimes. -Hook and bait size matter. These things will make the biggest difference on what size fish you can catch. Too big of hook and bait and a 8 pound fish cant eat it. Although they make your peg light up sometimes trying to. -Rod bend is really nice and your player is graphically sound -You see fish jumping out of the water or bubbles where they are feeding -Huge selection of rods, reels, and line. Bait selection is pretty good and or amazing for bottom fishing. Since its not bass the amount is good. -This is a 3D game and lake. You get to literally walk every inch of the lakes and can fish with one rod or use a peg with 3 rods. This is not that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fishing planet game where you are stuck in one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ section of a non existant lake or river. -They hold tournaments all the time and you can play solo tournaments -MULTIPLAYER!!!!! You get to fish with friends and watch them reel fish in!!! Holy crap and even can see their peg light up and hear their line screaming out.  -You get to walk all over the lake and decide where to fish -Good amount of lakes to choose from although you will be basically fishing the last 2 lakes which have the biggest fish.  -BOSS FISH! There are boss fish in game and make you want to fish all the lakes and even for small fish to try and catch these rare guys. They go from 2 pounds all the way up to 100. -You can use 3 rods and even use a bait rod to throw bait into the water over your current bait to help get bites. -You can fish night or day and can host a session or join someone elses -Easy to pick up and learn. -Different types of things to fish on. Gravel, Silt, Weeds -Weeds around lakes are obvious and only a idiot can't find them -Love the netting system. People are idiots and don't know how to net the fish so they complained a ♥♥♥♥ ton and now they are making a automatic netting system. Really hope they allow us to use the old manual system. It makes it more realistic and fun. -Casting system is really good and if you dont do it right you wont be casting far. Easy to learn, hard to master -Pretty Realistic  THE BADS-Here we go  -Tension and drag system is not working correctly in game yet. Its pretty bad, but even then its still fun to catch fish in this game. Makes me wonder how this company could screw this up since its literally a core part of the game mechanics -Rod, reel, line make no difference in catching fish. You can use the starter rod setup and catch the 100 pound cat in game. Just have to keep your tension at 16 and dont break it off and wait for fish to tire. Then you get him in -Fish seem to be on a rail system when caught. Almost like they aren't swimming. You really can't influence how the fish moves or which way. Although if you hold your rod far right or left they do seem to move that way eventually. -No player made tournaments yet. LAME! -The fish really don't effect the water. yea they jump and make a splash, but when hooked they wont do that. They make small splashes when close, but thats about it. -No in game voice chat just message system -The company doesn't seem to be worrying about the really important aspects of the game and just fixing small stuff that are being complained the most about. They really need to pull their heads out of their butts and fix the tension and drag issues as well as the fish on a rail system and not really swimming when caught. Although they said they are fixing rod bend so we will see what that is.   Conclusion- Although the bads seem really bad I still have a lot of fun with this game. I have been fishing since I was very young and I have played very few fishing games that made me enjoy it. This game has and I even meet some new players on there and we fish together. Its a great game and if they can fix some core issues it will be a absolute beast in the gaming/electronic fishing genre. This game has so much promise its crazy. I know its weird to say that about a game thats out and being bought. If you see it on sale its a must buy in my opinions. I paid the full 20 and think it was well worth it. They will be adding a new lake soon with Pike and lure fishing for the pike. So I am really looking forward to that. Hope this helps!    UPDATE: They lost my character who was top level with a ton of TP like over 60,000 and I had a lot of stuff unlocked in game. All my boss fish I caught everything gone. The only response I got was a link to their bs site that said nothing about how to fix it. Because there probably isn't a fix and they know it. I no longer support this game and hope it burns into the ground. The game updates have been abysmal to say the least. Not fixing important bugs or even the drag and reel system that isn't realistic in the least. It's like a really bad game made by 2 people who don't give a crap about any of the players. They seriously updated and took out maual netting. One of the few good things about the game and now its even more arcade because you wait for a fish to lose stamina while reeling endlessly without effecting the fish or you lose it for slack line. Terrible bs and the Devs need to be held responsible for all this crap and not actually fixing the important stuff. Thank you! DO NOT BUY OR SUPPORT THIS GAME!"

314660,Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty,"Man, I wanted to like this game so bad. I've known about the game since my childhood but never played it. Now that the HD version hit the store, I gave it a shot. But there is one fatal flaw: the gamepad controls. Here's mys experience using a wireless XBox 360 controller (user experience varies depending on gamepad used and on sheer luck) 1. If I use the default XBox 360 controller settings, I can't 'chant', which is an integral part of the gameplay. 2. Setting up a custom controller mapping makes it so that whenever I go into aim mode, Abe automatically turns to the right and stays locked, which means that I can never throw things to the left of me. 3. Using keyboard controlls and overwriting them with a gamepad to keyboard mapping program is dissatisfactory.  Since nothing helps to make the gamepad work and playing a platformer with the keyboard would mean I would be going straight to hell, I can only give this game another shot once the devs fix this egregious problem. Until then, I can't recommend it."

314810,Randal's Monday,"At one point, you have to distract a shop clerk. And to do that, you have to steal a pool cue ball. And to do that, you have to put a rotten lemon, and a battery in a priest's drink. But to do that, you have to obsessively check every single drain pipe in the city to find out which one has the rotten lemon. And the game never provides hints that you should do any of this - all you know is that you have to distract a shop clerk.   Earlier in the game, you have to break a globe. To do that, you have to use the right object on the right precise spot on the globe. But that's not quite enough, as doing that perfectly will still result in the game indicating you've done the wrong thing. Before it will work - before you get even a hint that you've done the right thing, figured the puzzle out - you have to successfully find the one 'Figure' in a huge mass of 'Figures.' The 'Figure' looks no different than the 'Figures' and you have no way of knowing that you have to find the 'Figure,' but you will not be allowed to proceed in the game, even to do the exact thing you should be doing, until you happen to accidentally run your mouse over that one 'Figure' amidst the larger zone of 'Figures'.   That's how the game works - although all adventure games should include some fun trial and error potential, this game takes it to ludicrous levels. Randal's Monday is everything that's ever been wrong with puzzles in adventure games.   Granted, the plot gets interesting as you get further into it, and the Clerks connection is very cool, but the adventure gameplay is terrible, the jokes fall flat, and the main character is too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to possibly sympathize with. All of the geek-culture references the advertising highlights are certainly present - not particularly funny nor worked into the plot at all - they're just kind of there, like a random picture of Donkey Kong on a calendar. Oh, look, it's Donkey Kong. Do you care? No, because you haven't yet figured out that you have to use the glue on the phone after you use the razor on the glue.  Lots of potential, but it's just not very fun to play."

314950,Spectre, Early Access Review
314970,Age of Conquest IV,"great job bro,  Age of Conquest IV has certainly cribbed a few graphical upgrades from Noble Master Games' recent titles. The prior Age of Conquest games were poster-children for the graphically spare, and with the fourth take, there's a little more life on the board. I'm uncertain if there's much to add beyond the alpha, but it's a clean and colourful game with a slick UI. The lack of zoom on touch devices can make delegating troop movement sometimes finicky on smaller screens, but that speaks more to my Neanderthal dexterity than anything else - and given that this is an alpha build, could be mitigated down the line with a pinch and zoom.  good luck."
314980,Supreme Ruler Ultimate,"I played all the Supreme Ruler games and this is one is by no means 'ultimate'! The AI is totally messed up, it just doesn't work. I tried many times but there's always some power that is completely OP and wipes out all of Europe and Asia. It's no fun to choose a smaller nation and play the long game anymore.   I thought the ultimate in this game was supposed to be about playing through the 20th century, but within ten years there are no countries left. I never felt I needed to warn my fellow steam users for a game. But this one is a turd, don't buy it! It brings absolutely nothing new and it doesn't really work. The UI is just as crappy as before so you might as well buy another Supreme Ruler game. I reccomend Supreme Ruler 2020."

315330,All Guns On Deck, Early Access Review
315340,A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX,"You should have known better for a god damn retake of the game.  Do you think letting players respawn a ♥♥♥♥ing meaningless sentence before each boss battle is enjoying? This game, although released in 2011, has learned nothing to the road of 2014 games, where respawning and checkpoints are at least upgraded as opposed to the old days.  No, this game instead tries to make you enjoy a terrifying experience by letting you die and die and die and you hardly are capable of learning anything new before having to do back route X to get to boss fight again. You end up wasting lots of time for nothing at all, nothing fun, nothing rewarding whatsoever.  The game's graphics are really top-quality in the genre, and the music is ok although becomes repetitive, just like the gameplay.  I unfortunatly have to thumb down this game, if not just for the fact that's it's a remake and it yet has one of the most frustrating gameplay flaws that none of the developers on the team have learned from the past. Just like we won't learn that war is a terrible thing, some gaming developers will never learn that checkpoints before an important something should, yes indeed, be played RIGHT BEFORE something important, not in front of a lift that wastes everytime 15 seconds if not more, seeing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again.  I would say, if you are really fond of the genre, then buy it, but you'll have to endure a lot of trial-and-error that is simply outdated and not satisfying. If you don't have the remake but the older one, stick with it."
315430,Polarity,"  An interesting idea though the game was predictable enough. I dont think it worth its money.Also the game is too short , and by that i mean it has not many maps and its not much of a challenge.In fact its just too easy"
315450,Bliss,"Good concept, great soundtrack. Puzzles are either laughably easy or incredibly difficult, not really any middle ground. Alright pacing for introducing new methods and objects. But holy s---, the controls are  ATROCIOUS . Even after figuring out the puzzle, I'll often need 5-10 tries just to get it right, because the controls are so terrible. It makes the game much more frustrating than it needs to be. Also, the butterfly lighting up the screen in the Denial stages? Good on paper, horrible in action. Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ I hate it."
315460,Dig or Die, Early Access Review
315480,The Escapist,"Pretty bad. The controls are not very intuïtive and though it claims to have Linux support, the audio was horrific on Linux, being all crackled. The level design isn't that great either. Finally, the controls could not be changed, which is always a terrible inconvenience fi you don't have a WASD keyboard layout."
315540,The Joylancer: Legendary Motor Knight, Early Access Review
315550,Taxi,"A good attempt at a Taxi game which falls just short of being a good game. I would give this a solid 5/10 where it would not be a downright horrible game and they made a sincere effort to make a good one, but the content just doesn't justify a positive review. Has a stats and management system to it which is interesting, neat mechanics such as enforcing traffic laws with signals and speeding, and makes you feel like you're running a cabby company, but the gameplay itself suffers when it comes to manually controlling the vehicles with a few bugs spread about here and there."
315610,Spud's Quest,"This is a charming little game. It has beautiful graphics with great sound to go with it, a fun story and some straight forward puzzles.  Really recommend it for those who like adventure side-scrollers and an overall relaxing game."
315650,Deep Under the Sky,"Why did you think it was a good idea to make a 1-button puzzle game? Who would pay money for this? Deep under the sky doesn't care. Deep under the sky knows what it wants to be, and does it well. Read its product description, it is extremely accurate. I can't really recommend the game, but damn these developers (Colin Northway and Rich Edwards) are groovy."

315810,eden*,"Normally, I do not really write reviews - i rather tend to read others. But - as I just have finished this excellent VN, I have to put my thoughts into words here for everyone out there who might be wondering if it is worth to get this piece of art.  To keep it short: This VN is simply a masterpiece.  The art. The soundtrack. The animation. The story.  It will blow your mind as you read through the ~10 hour long story. As it has a rather slow and long start, it starts off to get really intense and emotional mid/end part. This is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read - and one of the most tragic one's. Be prepared to get your heart filled with emotions - joy, passion, anxiety, sorrow - it is all packed in this masterpiece. The soundtrack combined with the carefully animated graphics with full voice over will bring you to tears - in a good way.  Right now I am still listening to the very very good sountrack and thinking about the story and the tragic fate of a young love.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-12TJyLvkVg   TL;DR: Grab a copy as soon as possible, every passionate VN lover should read this.  "
315830,Daedalus - No Escape,  This game IS NOT quake 3's baby. The graphics and gameplay pretty much look alike to a game called 'Infantry' created by Sony in about 12 years ago. Unfortunately this game is even worst than the game 'Infantry' because the character you are playing on the map is just a walking logo. While 'Infantry' can still see your own soldier's walking and running animation.   All the maps are feature inside a certain facility! It sure didn't look like you are lost in space.   The gameplay is great as long as there are at least 10 people condense in a narrow corridor while bullets are flying everywhere. So 1 vs 1 in this game is boring.

315850,Amazing Princess Sarah,Don't bother.
315860,Celestian Tales: Old North,"It very interesting game which I kind want to try all the options before I put in towel. Currently I looking to check the other perspectives, how they got where they got and I found character backgrounds so far interesting, I wondering if there part 2 in future? I am pretty sure there is sequel. I do wish them good luck in that. Replayability 6+ is probably is reason for the many options of possible..."
315920,Stonerid,"Save your money, unless you're either a Dryad or a weboo. 4/10 I idled for cards."
315930,Bravada,"Fast, simple, grid-based strategy game. Worth a buy."
315940,Top Hat,It is not a flawless game but it is fun and difficult just like the old NES games. 
316010,Magic Duels,I thought it played very much like the tabletop version it gives you time to stragise but makes you act fast at pressure moments would recomend it. Thanks.  Changed my mind after playing the verses battle!!!!  Love the game hate the cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on it download cheat engine if you want to progress past story mode i would say everyone else has (not my style ) played a MATCHED game he/she had nothing but gold cards and silver how can this be matched when i had a starter pack i have played magic for twenty years with the real cards shame on you modoraters and thanks for wrecking a great game
316020,Hangeki,THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME!  You get: Pro: -10 levels which you start with 10 health -a lot of challenges  -new and unique weapons -first game of the developers  Contra: -gets boring pretty fast -weapon unbalaced  facit: Don't expect this game to be perfect and entire fun at all. Think twice before buying.
316030,Alice in Wonderland,"The game is fun, but is it worth 20$ if you will run into alot of problems?  I am currently stuck at the Cabin with no way out and when I researched a bit, they say it's a problem with the game files?. Which sucks because at first this game was a 10/10!"
316080,Parcel,"Overall: Very good Difficulty: High  Likes: - Every set of puzzles introduces a new character with a new game mechanic, which keeps the game interesting - Very challenging, especially the later levels - Pretty satisfying when you complete a puzzle - Can quick save - Supports player-created levels  Dislikes: - Some of the later, more complicated puzzles feel less tightly designed because there are a lot of possible moves that look like they might lead to the solution. It often ends up being guess-and-check since it is hard to tell if you are headed in the right direction. - There is a loading screen every time you start or restart a level. It isn't too long, but it's still annoying, and not something I would expect in a puzzle game. - I wish there were an undo option (but at least there is a quick save). - The UI is a bit clunky, particularly switching between characters. - Sometimes the optional goals are not all achievable in a single attempt, and you will have to replay the level to do them. For example, sometimes if you go get the glowing orb, then a character or block will end up stuck. This seems like an odd design decision."
316140,Appointment With FEAR,"I really want to like this game, it has a good style and some humor to it. But there are so many randomly generated factors which I guess are included to make the game very replayable, but it really makes it feel like in a game about choices, nothing you choose to do ever really matters, because it comes down to whether or not it randomly generates positive actions in your favor.  There really isn't any method of strategy or choice to the game; and because most of its attempts at humor are really just lists of words randomly placed into scenarios/names with no connection to anything whatsoever, it tends to fall flat in that aspect as well. There are dozens of good CYOA games available on Steam, maybe not with the fun artwork and sound effects, but really just about any of those are better actual games than this."
316160,Broken Sword 4 - the Angel of Death,wow another dud gamewise. Lags non stop and it takes ages to even move. This and No.3 are not worth all the frustration to try and play . Heres Hoping No 5 is as good as 1 + 2.
316180,A City Sleeps,"Twin-stick bullet-hell shooter with a unique style. I found the difficulty to be pretty brutal, and not worth the trouble needed to take in everything the game has to offer. If you're extremely into this sort of game, and pretty good at it, you might find something really unique. But only recommended for serious hard-core fans."
316240,Professional Lumberjack 2015,although I have installed directx and has been carried out up dating and computer gene start this game still  problems running   &nbsp; professional Luber Jack 2015 this here may well make and low bedere into now has it it here   &nbsp;&nbsp; unless there is a too bederet up dating on the road can not give much more into two star
316260,Disney Universe,Love this game! Been playing non stop for the last few days. It's nothing serious nor does it require much thought which is I guess part of it's charm. Just a cute little game to zone out with. Disney fans like myself will appreciate the beautiful details in the movie based levels and playing as their favorite characters (can't wait until I unlock Stitch costume)! Would recommend :)
316320,Cars Toon: Mater's Tall Tales,"bought unable to use, do not know whom to contact... have used HDMI cable, use flat screen, pc has two video cards, not sure how to switch them but I think i did when i said to use flat screen only still not playing."
316370,Wave of Darkness,I probably would have had more patience with this game but even on the steam sale it was still pricey and for me just not fun at all. I asked for a refund after only playing it less than an hour. Not saying the game couldn't have potential some day but again the price for what it is and how it plays wasn't worth it to me.
316390,Anomaly Zone,Poorly optimized
316430,Battle of Empires : 1914-1918,Maje more mision where YouTube nered to defend a fort and add Croatia on the game there is Bosna and serbia why not Croatia.   
316480,Shadow Puppeteer,"The game itself is fun and enjoyable with fable-like graphics. The problem is with the game mechanics. It's incredibly frustrating when the controller randomly selects the items or just simply doesn't select any of them. The rope especially 'fun'. During the final boss fight I almost broke the controller, I was that frustrated. I'll try tomorrow to finish that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... The other things are the mechanical and graphical bugs, which happen at least once per level.  TL,DR: If you want to have a game which screws you over with it's mechanics and bugs, then it's for you."
316600,QP Shooting - Dangerous!!,The hardest part about this game are the visual distractions. Very fun despite that.
316610,A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build,"Don't let the cutesy graphics fool you into thinking this is some kind of leisurely casual puzzle game because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥. This itself isn't a problem, but the difficulty curve is. There isn't one. If you're as dumb as me, and you probably are, you'll find yourself staring at the same puzzle for what seems like forever, randomly shifting snow around until you luck out and find something that works. The way it's so complicated and therefore reliant on luck rather than reasoning removes pretty much all satisfaction that you'd have otherwise gained from 'solving' the puzzle."
316620,Space Galaxy - Graphics Pack,pff this is s**t for 40$
316630,Character Creator - Graphics Pack,"This Character Creator pack's review will be very similar to that which I wrote for the main Indie Bundle Graphics pack, which I backed on Kickstarter in the middle of 2012.  Like sound tracks on Steam, you are not buying an application. You're buying a bunch of content that downloads to your system and will be accessed directly.  This bundle comes with a large amount of content (often broken into pieces, so you can assemble them for a much larger variety of funished pieces) that can be used in prototyping your games, finished games, websites, and just about anything else. Personally, I use it for prototyping my projects (and possibly hiring an artist for custom work, when all is said and done).  At the time of writing, there are almost 1,300 images in this pack. For someone with no pixel-art talent, the character creator bundle is particularly useful for me. I no longer just copy and paste in ridiculous clip art from the web as placeholders or use big grey blobs to represent characters - I refer to the art pack and pull out *actual* artwork to make *actual* characters.  Anyone who would scoff at the price either doesn't actually need artwork or has not dealt with commissioning or licensing actual artwork for games or other projects. I have. You'll usually wind up with a lot more strings limiting your use of the content and you'll pay more than this entire pack costs just for one piece of art work - whether commissioned specifically for you or just licensed from an existing royalty-free clearing house.  If you don't know if you need or want this art bundle, then you probably don't. But you  know  if you do. And for the price, it's hard to pass up."
316660,Toast Time,It's pretty good
316700,Front Page Sports Football,"Worst iteration of a game ever made. Biggest mistake I have made in buying anything, even worse then the the time I bought a porcupine for toilet paper."
316720,planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~,"I really enjoyed planetarian, although short and kinetic (I prefer choices and multiple endings) it was an engaging story that had me hooked and kept me reading until completion. Planetarian is an absolute must read, though given the short read time (less than five hours on slightly faster than default autoread) I would recommend picking it up during a sale!"
316740,Biglands: A Game Made By Kids,This is horrible
316750,Tetris® Ultimate,Keeps on crashing. Do not buy. Waste of money since I can't even play it.
316790,Grim Fandango Remastered,"This is a really good game and worth your time. The story is fun and interesting and the puzzels are mostly fairly easy with one notable exception. There are guides on the internet that show you what to do, but with a little thought most of the tasks are not that hard. The story is based on the real mexican holiday 'the day of the dead'. The game takes it a step further and puts you, manny as a saleseman trying to help people reach the next world. The journey on foot takes four years, but using the money the souls were buried with they can choose a faster method as sold by manny. The story is essentially a crime thriller with a love interest and some twists and turns along the way. It uses a tank syle control system using the arrow keys and the mouse can be used. The people of the world are varied and interesting. I played this game when i was a kid and enjoyed it so much that I completed it several times. I thoguht it would be a nostalgia trip, but marking it now years later it holds up. There are some odd story choices and some 'why would that be there' moments, but overall the story works. The score is really good and, while the game is technically limited I thought it was crafted exceptionally well for what it is. It only takes around 8 - 10 hours to complete the story taking your time, but you can spend a lot longer exploring the details and going through all the voice options. You can never change the story though. There are specific things you need to get manny to say and do to progress so the story always ends the same, but, just like a good film I'd recommend playing this story. The theme is dark, but interesting and while you never know what the next world is it lets your make up your own mind just like you are free to believe whatever you want in the real world. I think you'll have a lot of fun and hopefully not too much frustration playing it, while leaving you to ponder on your own existance."
316810,Shadowcrypt,"I haven't played much of this game yet but I can say it's pretty awesome. I don't believe that it's worth 11$ in its current state though. Buy it on sale and it's a steal.  It's frustrating but addictive. The more I play, the better I get by learning the attack patterns. As mentioned previously in other reviews, I feel that the random drops can be pretty unfair because RNG Opop. This becomes more of a problem once you've died in later rooms and have to pick up where you left off with the starting equipment. Despite having several lives, everytime you die you lose your weapon and shield. In my opinion, this is what makes the game very difficult.  They may as well only give you one life... Because once I die and go back in with my noob gear and faceplant 3 times in a row, I'm stuck in an everlasting loop of eyerolling.(from being bad.)  11/10 would get rekt and slowly spiral into temporary insanity again. :B"
316830,Sprite Lamp,"Despite having a slight disagreement with my graphics card, the program still generates normal maps that have been working FANTASTICLY!"
316840,The Sacred Tears TRUE,Have fun running around. It's 90% of this game. Battle system gets boring quickly and lacks depth imo. Also as far as I know you can't escape once you trigger an encounter. Game is tiny - handful of dungeons and one city.   It's bad. There are better jRPG's out ther for similar price.
316890,Calvino Noir,"Game crashes at launch with an error message if steam is not online. The dev has confirmed that it is a bug and promised a fix 5 months ago. Nothing came and the game is still unplayable in offline mode. Don't ask me what I think of the game I paid for: since it doesn't launch, I've no idea what it's like."
316930,Kings of Kung Fu,"Never have I wanted a terrible game, NOT to be terrible. I really wanted to like this, I really wanted this to work. If it was even a halfway competent fighter I would probably forgive it. But it isn't. It is simply bad. Mechanically bad. The controls are beyond stiff, the specials are unresponsive, I feel like there is horrible input lag as if I were online with someone in croatia even when playing against the AI (which exists as far as I know right here in my own computer).  This game has some cool style, and flawlessly emulates the Kung-Fu personas each of its characters are based off of. The dang Sonny Chiba from 'The Streetfighter' character was enough to make me smile. But it just doesn't play well. I hoped at first it didn't play well do to it being unfinished back when it was in EA. But even now in its supposedly complete state it plays worse than pit fighter.   Really to bad, because for fans of old school Martial Arts flicks like myself something like this woulda been a joy to play. But it honestly feels broken and unfinished."
316950,War Operations,AI is god. They shoot me through walls and have reaction times of 15ms.
316970,The Waste Land,"Uh... wtf?  Game: Here's how you play. Cool? Me: Oh yeah, this is awesome! Game: Want to play through the credits!? That's like totally super awesome! Me: Yeah... I've done that once or twice. It's neat. Totally. Game: The graphics and music are totally old school greatnees. The story is high class and based off poetry! Love me!! Me: ... ok, sure, I'm digging this. I love this stuff... there's typo's and stuff but whatever, it's the thought that counts. Game: Great... now go kill something you're not supposed to... Me: ... *kill* Game: Good, now there's this random man/woman that's gonna tell you to fix what you did. Me: ... *read dialog* Game: Have fun! A woman made this!!!11! Me: ... hmmm.... yeah, this isn't me anymore. We should see other gamers. *burns $8*"
3170,King's Bounty: Armored Princess,"A charming, colorful RPG where you wage turned-based battles"
31700,Iron Grip: Warlord,"NOT Recommended !  Maybe I just did not get it but,  yeck"
317020,Pajama Sam: Games to Play on Any Day,I don't like it but it's probably because I am not a kid anymore. There may be something for thme here but for me it is not a recommendation.
317030,Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise,It almost seems right that I write my first ever review on Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise since it is one of the first games I've ever played as a child. It is still as charming as ever (although shorter than I remember!). Pure nostalgia. I definitely recommend this game for small children or anybody longing to wear a pair of rose tinted glasses and take a strole down memory lane. Fatty Bear is a straight up G.
317040,Strife: Veteran Edition,"When I was a kid I got Strife because I was told I'd like it because I like Doom. And I love Doom a whole lot.  But I have to let you in on a secret about Strife.  The secret is Strife is a bad game  with bad map design and bad enemies and bad weapons  Veteran edition is a totally competent rerelease, but sadly it's a rerelease of Strife."
317060,Attractio,This game was cool  10/10 will definitely continue to die of fall damage.
317080,MotorSport Revolution,"It is a very frustrating experience. I tried to play the game but I feel like It is so horrible that I feel lazy and I won't lose my time to give a try to this creapy game. just a couple of laps in the first circuit and that's it. It is much worse than what comments say. Menus, sounds, gameplay, graphics... everything is so unaccptable!!!! I have bought it on a cheap bundle and I still thing that I paid too much for what I obtained."
317100,Republique,"might be a fun game, looks cool, yet. Im not used to how the game works and not so much first person."
317250,Airscape: The Fall of Gravity,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.  This game is unconceivably awful in a multitude of ways, which I shall delve into in further detail later  -It runs terribly. -The gravity is broken. -The orchestrated soundtrack becomes agonizing after the first level. -The game is programmed awfully. Like, really awful. -The underwater gameplay is broken, infuriating, and has terrible 'controls' if you can even call them that. -The level design is abysmal. -The camera is hard or impossible to control. -Your direction, controls, and even momentum are controlled be the camera, meaning switching gravity can easily kill you. -It is filled with tedious, unnecessary mechanics. -Even walls don't work.  Let's start with the programming. This game had no playtesting. It makes the most pitiful mistakes in places that can't be unnoticeable. When you enter water, the sound becomes hushed to create that underwater sound effect, however when you die the sound effect continues after respawning and until you enter and exit water again. This happenes every time you die in water with a checkpoint out of water and is impossible not to notice. Other sad mistakes include selecting 'return to game' with the jump button in a pause menu will cause you to re-enter the game with a jump and also the inability to program counters. I beat the boss of the game after about 9 hours of regretful gameplay, and the game gave me the achievement for beating it in under an hour. Another broken achievement was the one you get for saving all timed sea critters, which I got on the 3rd to last timed sea critter. Back to the boss, between phases my music cut out. For the rest of the boss battle and the afterwards there was no music. After the boss where I continued to have no music, I could not find a way to leave the level or pause to exit. I assume they didn't program one in, but correct me if I'm wrong. In the game are also moving platforms. When you stand on one, your character vibrates perpetually. This doesn't cause any gameplay problems, but it just looks god awful.  On the topic of walls, if the camera or gravity is tilted a little, sliding down walls that you can't attach to will lead to more glitchy jagged movement. Sometimes you can even jump up walls at a small angle. The design of some platforms show rough edges, and jumping against them reveal its hitbox to follow its design so that your jump will be cancelled when jumping on or against them from the wrong angle. Sometimes, jumping into a wall can send you inside or through it. This has happened enough times for me to tell you that you can get stuck in the dirt walls and usually go through the metal ones.   Next, the gravity engine is broken beyond belief. Gliding in the air, you can run into different fields of gravity from other parts of the map; However, you can only be attracted to one field at a time. This means that the moment you touch the other field, your character will turn around in an instant and will also be flung in that direction. The momentum in the game is also broken. If you jump onto a planet directly above you, your chacter will have to turn 180 degrees and, as mentioned earlier, your momentum will follow the camera, so jumping to a planet directly above you can lead to being flung to the left or right. This isn't usually an issue though because usually there isn't too much death nearby the gravity switch parts, nor are the distances at the perfect range for the most momentum to be in the wrong direction before the camera finishes turning. What is an issue is how the controls become inversed the moment gravity changes so that you have to plan your landing exactly because there's little to no human control to fixing yourself in quick gravity switches.  The underwater portions of the game are the worst of the worst. To move in water, you push the swim button. That's it. There is no backwards, left, or right: just forward. If you want to move in any other direction, you have to turn the camera. This is a pain because both the camera is slow and you continue sliding too far as if on ice. If you move forward just a little too much, this is no turning around unless you have the 5 seconds to turn the camera. If that sounds infuriating, try to imagine making precise movemnts through timed and moving obstacles and dodgin enemies. Another problem with water is that is has no gravity. This means that the moment you leave the water you will be flung towards whatever direction the gravity is facing. Many levels with water feature it in a sort of tube shape where you have to move forward precisely with the perfect direction and moment to stay inside with only one side that you can pop your head out of. To exit a pool of water, you have to swim out with momentum. You build up momentum as you swim, so if you are on the surface of water you will not be able to exit unless you painfully turn around, swim forward, turn around again, and plunge out. Even if this wasn't tedious, it's impossible to play, and mistakenly landing in the wrong portion of the water with the wrong amount of momentum can instantly screw a run. Trust me when I say that the frequency of this is huge, and that there are many obstacles where you'll constantly run into this throughout the game.  The level design has no idea what it's doing at all. I got this weird feeling all throughout the game that no one making it really cared, but strangely enough there were a bunch of fun and creative ideas that were put into levels. Only the ideas were fun, and the execution was always infuriatingly bad as if someone made the levels based on someone else's ideas. They'd take an idea like moving pools of water that you have to climb up and make it unnecessarily hard by putting missiles and lasers everywhere. This sort of thing happens the entire game where the levels are made extremely overcomplicated for no good reason. There are some levels where mines are laid out randomly like as if a level maker was handed out to an 8 year old. So many of the obstacles were completely unnecessary and ruined the enjoyability of simple levels. Also, take into account all the previous complaints and imagine what it feels like to go through these levels.  As the levels further, new mechanics are introduced, and not a single one of them are good or well executed. First off, you have heat syncing missiles at the start of the game and will continue for all the zones. There are also turrets and snipers that hunt you down from a distance and, like mines and lasers, are placed wherever they can to be needlessly hard. A personal favorite is the poisonious water that kills you for being in it for more than 5 seconds, and already mentioned is how hard it is to enter and leave bodies of water, so imagine a mechanic that makes you do that repeatedly.  Lastly, the game runs with frequent stutters that can freeze up to 2 seconds. It lags constantly. Simple things like explosions can cause massive lag, and usually the game throws about ten repeating missile launchers in the same area. I don't even know how explosions can cause this much lag for such a simple game. The game runs consistentally at less than 40 fps. I bought a fancy new graphics card recently, and I still ran the game at the lowest resolution and lowest everything else just to be safe, though it didn't help much. It lags so much that it's absolutely unplayable. The audio glitches out too, and some levels with the water effect glitch builds up the glitchy static-y audio until it literally turns off until leaving water. Under tough circumstances, some blocks don't even load. This happened very rarily, but frequently on the level it did, which was the absolute final level that I hope no one ever gets to. I really can't stress this enough, but the game lagged terribly and was nothing but lag; It's practically an endurance test.  tl;dr There is nothing good about this game. Get it on sale to send to friends you don't like."
317280,Solstice,  I don't like it. There is no fun and the lag becomes real. You should put more maths and guns and bombs. There should be lot's of games that eat this.
317300,Roommates,I was not really excited by the characters or writing. There isn't much of a plot aside from small talk. The game mechanics are pretty standard for these types of games and and just weren't enough to make up for the aforementioned shortcomings.
317320,Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet,"A thoroughly lovely game, which has a wonderful sense of gentle, British humour attached to it. I had a lovely time playing Nelly Cootalot, and unlike a lot of adventure games I've played, all the puzzles were logical and straight-forward. So much so, that I didn't need to refer to a guide at all during my play-through, which is unusual for me when I play these kinds of game.  Plus it has Tom Baker in it (amongst the excellent voice cast) - so what other reason do you need to buy it ;)"
317330,Defenders of Time,Nice game sadly it's overpriced not enough content ( missing campaign story mode). This game worth free to play   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQVu5ju5Sfs&amp;list=UUjLty5-4xTFtGlx0vlD_SFw 
317360,Double Action: Boogaloo,"This game is fun for about 5 minutes if you have no friends to play with, but if you play with your friends, it is really fun!"
317380,War on Folvos,"Not a terrible game for the money, lacks mission to mission continuity. No; promotions, awards, keeping you best units. Its also confusing, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to when or where you can repair/heal and reload your ground units. While you are trying to figure this out, you run out of time. Still, if you like a tough challenge, give it a go."
317410,Color Symphony,"Your worst enemy is the camera. You expect a game with color-switching to have visibility-based challenges, but you'd expect this to revolve around the colors. Nope, the game is so zoomed-in, that you can't see the floor for a good 3 seconds after double jumping. Then you get to see it for a millisecond before landing.  At to this that the background is uniform, and the levels are sparse with details, and most of the time you have no idea how far you went while jumping. Given that some of the puzzles require you to have pin-point accuracy, this is a real problem. You're going to need a lot of guesswork and counting in your head to hit your mark.  The game also runs very bad. Every time you get hit, it'll take an hour to get up. By then, your HP would have already refilled. Unless you fell down a bottomless pit, then you get to excrutiatingly wait for a retry.  Speaking of excrutiating waits, the platforms also move super-slow, yet super-skippy. The game runs at like 2 frames per second. And calling the controls 'unresponsive' is an understatement.  Add a few 'guess what comes next', 'guess where you are', and 'now an obstacle in a randomized color will spawn right on top of you, 50:50 chance you make it through', and you get an overall annoying experience.  Worst part of all, the game isn't even particularly challenging. It's just excrutiatingly long. Half of the time, you just try over and over until you get lucky with the RNG or blind timing. The puzzles are meh, and if it wasn't for the artificial difficulty added by the poor visibility and controls, the game would be super-easy.  The story doesn't try to make sense, either.  The concept is decent, but the game needs an overhaul. The engine needs to be rewritten from scratch, and, at a bare minimum, there has to be some sort of pattern on the background so you can at least navigate once you've memorized the level. At least when I Want To Be The Guy throws random stuff at you, you can memorize where they are."
317440,Quantum Rush Champions,"I kinda like it! It has flaws, yes, but hey, it's alright  + : the tracks for sure, I love these futuristic environments, modes, racers, weapons  - : you don't really know what hit you, ai is 2hard4me  it's not the best , 6.5/10, but GG, and if you like it, it's worth a try! sale purchase tho  would rush again"

317530,Congo, Early Access Review
317580,Toy Story Mania,"This game is a collection of mini-games with our very well-known famous cartoon heroes. It's OK for little kids to play and have some fun out of this game, better yet if played in company."
317610,Prophour23,"Dudes talkin about the tutorial saying how it moves too quickly; I have no idea what they're talking about.  I understood all the concepts. If anything, it needed to be more fluid, as you must die each time to get to the new section basically. You could have quite easily kept me on the same screen to present all the information about, say, thorns, and how they work.  One can sit and look at the complexities of how you're forming a living thing and how difficult it can be to surive. Instead I'm going to refer to it as the game that it is, instead of looking at it like a piece of conceptual art.  Its a top-down tower defence featuring bees that don't fly for some reason.  The heart pumps blood and that's what you use to create organs that do many things. and let me tell you, this game is logically sound.  Take the stomach. It can grow into Lungs. The human body is really something. Oh, it has a concept of the passage of time, and it therefore becomes dark, mostly to inflate the difficultly, as I found out right away. You fix this, with eyes, but the eyes require musles as all things do in this game, and what they provide is a very very limited view.   Graphics are suberb, and the music at the beginning when you open the game is great, but it quickly dies out. That previous sentence is a metaphor that contains two meanings: 1. The state of the 'organism' that I created once it gets dark 2. My interest"
317620,Space Hulk Ascension,"I recommend the game mainly because I think that it delivers on what it is supposed to be. It brings back memories of earlier strategy games and can be difficult. Not be very familiar with the warhammer games, here is what I think could have been improved as a video game when compared to other stratey games.  1. Squad make up - you can't do much customization on the squad. You get a sargent or templar, a heavy and 3 soldiers. It would be nice to have a little more customization and flexibility. 2. Squad equipment - each squad member has set equipment. Coupled with the fixed squad make up, it lacks the ability to allow you to customize the individuals in the group. You get more options as you advance, but not enough to really differentiate the characters. 3. Maps - all of the maps take place on the space hulk ships. So they are all cooridoors with small rooms. It lacks a little variety. It would be nice to have high / low areas, open areas, cover, etc. 4. Grid - the map is built as squares so there are only 4 directions. This works because of the map layouts, but lack some of the flexibility that hex based map systems provide."
317710,Velocibox,"This is a try-again fail-again twitch puzzler. Well made, solid mechanics, fast paced, quick games. Conceptually, I like it.  However, I suck at it, I'm too damned slow.  Must needs more practice."
317720,Tiestru,It's got a surprising deficit of strategy for a tower defense game. And those orcs are completely devoid of character. Why are they bashing my towers? Why are they all identical except the color of their armors? Why do they take so many damn lasers to kill?
317730,REVERSE SIDE, Early Access Review
317820,Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"While I like some parts of Guild of Dungeoneering, there are also enough problems with it that I cannot recommend this one.  Pros - the art style; what can I say, I just like how it works  - building the dungeon; that too is an interesting part of the game and can be used to the player's advantage when trying to increase the character's level  Cons - loss of progression; okay, okay, I understand that the greedy sod running the guild is only in it for the money and that the gear disappears after the dungeon has been run but why does the character's level go away? Once the level one quests are completed having the character mysteriously return to 1st level and lose the extra hearts earned through adventuring makes trying to complete the next level of the dungeon an exercise in luck  - certain monsters have this uncanny knack of getting just the cards they need round after round. I have noticed that this starts with second level monsters (skeletons particularly).  These may seem to be small complaints but they really suck the fun out of the game. Thankfully on bought it at a good discount during a sale. Your experience may be different but wait for another sale.   "
317840,Dokuro,Creative game good premise and was probably fantastic on the PSVita however the PC version does not support any sort of basic gamepad support so your hands cramp up due to being restricted to the keys AD &lt;&gt;? for controls and then using the mouse on occasion. Honestly I really like how the game looks and the mild story that it encompasses but I simply cannot get past these abominable controls. Case in point if your going to release a pc game atleast give use some options so we can atleast map our own controls. Having to use Joytokey to force controller support is not my idea of fun basic start up in a game as casual as this.
317940,Karmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame,"The simplest and shortest reveiw I can give is 'It's a mixed bag with a fair share of flaws, but If you are a fan of platforming, artsy visuals and rock, then you'll like this game!'   The longer reveiw is harder to do since on one hand I love this game and on the other hand I hate it.  The game was crowdfunded and didn't meet its full funding goal, which shows. Conceptually it's a great game and has a lot of potential with interesting game mechanics, but it looks like not much thought or time was put into the game's level designs, especially during the later parts of it. By the near end of the game, everything looked rushed to the point that I would have thought this was a beta version and not the full release.   The game also doesn't do a very good job at telling you what to do or where to go. This makes it very easy to get stuck and tediously explore every square inch of the map untill you figure out what you need to do to progress to the next stage. When added to awkward camera angles, imprecise controlls and unforgiving platforming, it's easy to get frustrated while going from one stage to another.  Yet for all its flaws, there is a deep sense of immersion in the game. The atmosphere is brilliant, the music is amazing, the art style is absolutely gorgeous and the story and characters are captivating. The only flaw to the game's story element I can see is a slight lack of clarity to the plot and a rather binary choice mechanism for the end stage.   Ultimately I would give this game a 7 out of 10 with the main pros and cons being as such:  PROS: -Excelent atmosphere -Great music and art style -Good replay value -Captivating story and characters -Interesting game mechanics  CONS: -Awkward camera angles -Inaccurate controls -Frustrating 3D platorming -Unclear instructions and direction to goals  -A fair amount of bugs and glitches even with the patch  I liked this game and reccomend it, but I would also reccomend it be bought during a sale or put a little lower on your wishlist."
317950,KEL Reaper of Entropy, Early Access Review
317970,Dusk 12,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had in gaming. The game is broken and, in my opinion, not worth one cent. I do not reccommend getting this, sale or not. Save yourself a migraine and a bit of frustration. This isn't a game, it's a joke."
31800,Nancy Drew: Danger By Design,Really fun to play. Keeps you on your toes and is really interesting. The puzzles aren't to hard but definitley give you a bit of a challenge. I love this game and would play it over and over again.
318020,Act of Aggression,"I can see how a lot of people would really enjoy this game. It ticks a lot of the boxes to be a really solid RTS. It's a lot like Command and Conquer: Generals as many have said, although I strongly disagree that it's the spiritual successor.  I absolutely love the C&amp;C series. Generals was fantastic, and I always wished for a new one. After trying for many hours to get into this game and enjoy it, and telling myself 'It's like a new Generals!' I just can't play it anymore. I don't find it fun at all. It's one of those games that looks decent graphically, and sounds like what you want, but then you play it and simply find yourself not having any fun. It's extremely bland, has no personality, and just feels like a really generic RTS.  It does some things a little differently from Command and Conquer, and for me personally, each of these differences is for the worse. I find the UI to be clunky, cumbersome and ugly. The units and buildings seem to be somewhat realistic in size, which sounds great, but in practice it means infantry are more or less little specks on the map, and vehicles are so small you can hardly enjoy their visuals and see what makes them visually unique, unlike most other RTS games and especially Generals. I have to scroll way in, and when I do, everything looks surprisingly awesome as far as detail, much more than I'm used to in an RTS. But it doesn't matter, because no one plays zoomed in near ground level, so you'll never see any of it.  In the end, this isn't by any means a bad game. You might really enjoy it, as many do. I can see why people do. But personally, for me, this is just a bland, generic, incredibly un-fun version of Generals.  UPDATE:  After having played the Reboot of the game, I've changed my review to recommend the game. I wrote this game off after I played it, and haven't touched it since release. I heard they were launching a Reboot of the game by tweaking and changing numerous aspects of the gameplay based on user feedback. They've simplified the gameplay by making there be a single currency, base construction is now done via construction units (like many RTS games), while upgrades are found on their respective buildings. These changes alone may not sound like much, but they significantly impact the feel of the game, and the intuitiveness of the UI.  Although there's still room for improvement, and I wouldn't yet classify this as on the same level of classics like C&amp;C, the numerous changes they've made add up to- for me- a vastly more enjoyable game, and one I'd recommend checking out. In an age of early access scams, lazy development, and games that are abandoned after the money is made, the developers continuing commitment to this game is impressive. After taking heavy criticism (from people like me), rather than pack up and jump ship after they made their money, they listened to the criticism and continued to work on the game and improve it based on what people wanted.  This kind of approach to game development is sorely missed today, and I have a huge amount of respect to the devs for it. I, and plenty others, played it, didn't like it, and shelved it. The devs listened, and cared enough to put effort into making the game fun for those who bought it and invited them to come back and give it a try. Well, it paid off. I came back and gave it a try, had a lot of fun, and have changed my review to a positive recommendation. Even if it may or may not be among the best of all time (yet), if you're looking for a fun new, modern day RTS, the new Act of Aggression is a safe bet, and worth checking out."

318100,AXYOS, Early Access Review
318130,Doom & Destiny,"You have to start the whole game over when you die. Too low resolution. Can't change controls. Annoying sound effects in menus, can't turn menu sounds off. No full screen. Hard to know what button to press to pick up items. I passed a shedload of valuable items before I knew I could press a button to pick them up. The game never explained that to me. You have to figure it out by yourself, which sucks."
31820,Nancy Drew: The Haunted Carousel,"My first Nancy Drew game... It was such a long time ago, but now I own almost all of them! It has a special place in my heart."
318220,Enforcer: Police Crime Action,"I love the concept for the game, to play as a cop and this game has so much potential, though the devs for this have probably just taken the money they got and ran. This game needs to be in the hands of developers that are deticated to this game. Until the devs come back and finish this game, my opinion is this. DO NOT buy this game, save your money if you want a good game about police go buy 'This is The Police' which is a very good game in my opinion that involves police."
318230,Convoy,"Great game. Looking for FTL but with deeper combat tactics rather than gear checks and a Mad Max feel, this is the one for you.  It doesn't have the sheer level of random events FTL does but there's plenty to keep you interested and like FTL the 'Correct' path is randomized so you can't just learn them anyway. The game manages to be difficult without requiring 1 specific way of building in order to win with any consistency and has me repeatedly coming back for another try with another MCV/Escort combination.  Cannot recommend this game enough."
318260,Supreme: Pizza Empire,"I work at a real pizza place, I make the food, I've delivered the pizza, even ran the place while the managers were out and about.. This game really hits home with me. The music, the quality ingredients, every single detail is a mirror image of life in a pizzeria! I am telling you, the delivery missions are probably the most fun I've had playing a game.. ever. The customer interaction is accurate (You have no idea what you're doing and they're yelling at you because of it) Ultimately I would reccomend this game, but not the actual pizza man lifestyle!  Edit: They changed the driving mechanics, the ai doesn't stop at red lights anymore, the update somehow made the map look worse than it did originally and it just all around doesn't feel like the same game it used to. I'm done makin pizza"
31830,Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor ,"I quite enjoyed this. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting but what I got was a compentent, well connected, adventure/puzzle game. I could mention a couple puzzle annoyances but they're minor and I wouldn't want spoil anything.  So, yeah! Good job devs."
318300,Phineas and Ferb: New Inventions,"This is a wonderfully made game with a suprisingly deep emotional story. This game is a visionary piece of entertainment where the gameplay, characters, art style and story all come together to make what undoubtedly will be considered one of the best games of this generation. The story has stirred me speechless and compelled me to think.   10/10. would reccomend."
318310,Choice of the Deathless,"Man, this was so fun. I always gravitate towards 'Choose Your Own Adventure' games but a lot of them end up disappointing me as the choices and story gradually... grays out. However, Choice of the Deathless was consistently fun from beginning to end - the choices always had such character and the world-building was fascinating. The characters were also really varied, interesting, and just plain cool, especially the firm's partners. Also, who doesn't appreciate being a sorcerer-lawyer with the power to (eventually) equal gods, it's just awesome. Overall, this is a game that is definitely worth every cent and I heartily recommend it."
318330,Mecha Ace,"I cannot believe this doesn't have reviews, I just restarted the game after completing it last year and wanted another one like it.  To make this short, this game reminds me of the good old 'choose your own adventure' novels with a mecha twist. As a big fan of Gundam (which this gane is full of references), Evangelion and other mecha anime, I cannot recommend this enough for mecha fans!  "
318350,Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell's Adventure,"You really want to explore the locations that weren't at the movie, don't you? So, click on your mouse and let you play in the very interesting game. Well, the interface is like in old school arcades. But if you like Disney Fairies - especially Tinkerbell and her best friends - you are played in it!"

31850,Nancy Drew: Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake ,"I remember seeing this game on store shelves when I was eight and wanting to buy it so badly. I finally got to play it and it did not disappoint. Although I did find the beginning easy to get lost and stuck in (perhaps even a bit frustrating), the game does not feel as linear as some of the more recent ND games I have played. I thought that some of the games backgrounds really did still look nice despite their age as for the rest of the backgrounds, not so much. The characters look really dated. Luckily, the soundtrack has not and I really appreciated the music. The puzzles are fun and challenging. Solving them will take some creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. What's more, the game didn't feel like I was just going from puzzle to puzzle, task to task. I felt like I was exploring something and on an adventure. My only real problem with the game is the ending. Nancy's summary in her letter felt rushed and short. I was so drawn into the game, that I really want more information about the afternath. Nevertheless, unless you really hate roman numerals, this is a great ND game."
318530,Wings of Vi,"An exercise in frustration from a designer that's just not very good.  No, I didn't get very far because having my time wasted is just tiresome.  The primary mechanic is a drop-jump, where you can jump anywhere in midair, but only once. This means basically every jump you think you MIGHT be able to make...you can't. Unless you run off the ledge, then jump in midair for that extra foot of boost. So every time you just approach a jump like any sensible game, you're going to be short. And die. And forced to replay a section.  Then you get a flutter-feather item that allows you to hover briefly, and immediately are forced to use it to snake between instant-kill traps on the top and bottom. If you mess up? Yes, you're replaying a section again.  The instant-kill traps are chained in succession immediately after you get the flutter item, meaning you're going to be forced to replay the same bits over and over right when a powerup should be FUN: When you get to play around with it and see how your skillset has expanded. Instead any enjoyment you'd derive from a new item and new exploration/manoeuvre ability is killed by immediately being told you have to be an expert with it, or else you're going to hit your head against the wall.  Even in the short amount I played, I ran into three seperate enemies/obstacles that were invulnerable, but still reacted and appeared to take damage when attacked...only displaying a '0' showed me they weren't taking damage. This is honestly unacceptable. If you can't damage an enemy MAKE THAT PLAIN via another type of reaction. If they're never killable, make them not able to be hit at all. If you can do it, later, somehow...use some kind of 'bounce off' where it's plain you're hitting but just unable to injure.  Add to this enemies that fly around rapidly, take multiple hits, and who aren't hitstunned so they simply run through your attacks and hit you...and you have a recipe for tremendous frustration at the designer.  At this point I just became frustrated and quit, I'm unwilling/unable to force myself through the bad design any more in order to try to find the 'good' in the game.  Could have used actual playtesting from someone not interested in how 'hardcore' they are. I'd recommend it to no-one.  Addendum: All the comments I'm receiving are 'You suck at this genre, so get good.' Maybe I do. But maybe people would like to know beforehand what the game is like, for people who don't excel in this particular genre of game. It isn't noted anywhere in particular that the game is extremely difficult in a particularly genre-specific manner. It just looks like a 2D platformer with some well-done visuals.  If you know you like this type of game, my review isn't going to be useful. If you aren't aware what sort of game this is, and you don't like that type of game? It's probably going to be useful. That's why this review is here."

318680,History in Letters - The Eternal Alchemist,"So I bought this game because I had a coupon and love point and click adventure games. Even with a coupon I don't think the price was worth it (EDIT: on sale for $10 from $15 USD). I got all the achievements (less 2) in 6 hours. Every dialogue advancement causes the character sprites to flicker. Most puzzles are skipable - which on the one had is nice so you don't get stuck, on the other makes the game a lot shorter. The incentive to complete the puzzles is to get the achievement and your money's worth - although most of them could be solved with random guesswork and button pushing. And others, when I eventually did figure out what you're supposed to do, there was no context clue that I could find to hint at that solution (I'm looking at you last puzzle of the game). Without seeing the achievement title I likely would have been stuck longer.  To make matters worse, I tried to start a new game to see if I could clean up missing achievements - I found on a second playthrough you get glitched halfway through the game and cannot advance. On a second playthrough, the items in your inventory that you need to find are greyed out in the hidden object scenes. This is annoying but not game breaking. What does break the game is when you are in the library and need to solve a simple guess puzzle of putting books on the shelf based on the author's nationality, the books vanish from your inventory when you click on them. This puzzle cannot be skipped. Exiting the unbeatable puzzle causes all other inventory items to disappear. I only fixed this by deleting all my save data and starting again - not a huge loss since I completed the game a second time within an hour.  All that said, I really did have some fun with this game, mostly because there was no guide and I had to figure everything out myself. But when I look at its faults and the total gameplay time, I'd strongly suggest only buying it when it's on sale, if at all."

31880,Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock,"This was my first Nancy Drew game, and I was surprised by how challenging it was! Every detail is significant - I recommend keeping your own notes in addition to the one Nancy keeps for you. The puzzles were great and the story was entertaining, if a little hokey.   There were a few elements that were a matter of moving the mouse correctly rather than a matter of solving clever puzzles, specifically: mini golf, delivering telegrams to earn money, using the sewing machine, and the car chase. As someone who has never been great at moving characters or objects skillfully on a computer screen, I found these both frustrating and time consuming.   But overall, very fun - I'm looking forward to playing more Nancy Drew games!"
318860,Malebolgia,Overall I rather enjoyed this game. It has an interesting art style and I feel a lot of time and love went into the story. the combat mechanics are admittedly a little wonky but otherwise good. I would defintely give this game a play if you haven't yet.
31890,Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand ,"This is one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. I've played this through at least twice, once on my own account and once on a friends (before I bought it for myself). If you like the ND games then you will love this one."

318970,StarCrawlers, Early Access Review
31900,Nancy Drew: The Creature of Kapu Cave,"​I adore the Nancy Drew mystery series. They're excellent point-and-click adventure games with a kooky sense of humor, fun minigames, and great puzzles. However, this one was hands-down my least favorite of the series.   Plot: There was very little? The game focuses too strongly on the mechanism of being both Nancy and the Hardy Boys (which is fun, sure, but not enough to carry the game), and not enough time is spent unraveling the plot. Instead of letting the player put all the pieces together, the answer is just dumped on you in several minutes of exposition at the end of the game.   Minigames: There were three. An arcade game version of rock paper scissors (seriously,) making shell necklaces according to a pattern (you have to acquire the shells by either wandering the beach/scuba diving for the rest of your life, or buy them from the little store. Some necklaces cannot be completed without purchasing items, which was boring), and fishing. Yes. Fishing. You click the horizon. Wait for the bobber to drop. Click the bobber. Bam, fish. That was the whole thing.   Puzzles: There were a number of puzzles, which ranged from busy work (separate insect parts from seeds and count them, do math, write up a chart), to 'push buttons in order that you saw them in the hallway,' to 'make one hundred snow cones for some guy until he tells you you did it right.' None of these were especially entertaining or needed much use of your mind to complete them. At the end there is a completely nonsensical puzzle where you guide one of the Hardy Boys to jump onto a stone pathway... and he dissapears and reappears randomly around the pathway? That's not... how pathways work? I don't understand.   Snooping/Exploring: There was very little! Most of the locations are just long pathways to click through. I want to rummage through people's desks and sneak into their bedrooms, but we don't really get to do that much at all in this game.   Characters: Nancy Drew usually has a variety of colorful, weird, kooky characters. This time? We have an angry guy, a rambling woman who is more annoying than charming, and a guy and his daughter who play the parts of Stereotypical Hawaiian Native and Stereotypical Surfer Girl.   Also... this game did not age well at all. Even the updated version for steam was... yikes."
319050,Chaos Reborn, Early Access Review
319080,Disney Princess :  My Fairytale Adventure,i love this game idc if im a boy playing it cause its awesome. my favorite is belle
31910,Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy,"I'm a huge fan of the HerInteractive Nancy Drew games, and 'The Haunting of Castle Malloy' is no exception to this addiction! I found this game to be really fun, I loved the change of scenery with Ireland.  If you're already a fan of these games, I'd recommend adding this one to your queue. If not, it would be a fun game to introduce you to the rest!"
319140,Xeodrifter™,not any good
319150,Hazard Ops,"It's an abortion. Ftp and still overpriced. Do yourself a favour, don't."
319170,G-Force,scary
319180,Platypus II,"While technically, there's nothing wrong with Platypus II (aside from the terrible difficulty and 'perculiar' game choices), Platypus II is a shameless cashgrab that tries to grab the fans of the original Platypus by the balls and say 'LOOK A SEQUEL! BUY BUY BUY!!!'. Not to mention the absolutly bizzare final level and it's awful graphics and the worst part about this game. THE AUDIO IS CONSTANTLY PANNED TO THE LEFT JESUS CHRIST HOW THE HELL DO YOU NOT REALIZE THE AUDIO'S BROKEN.  Buy it if you really want more 'Platypus Action' but don't come in expecting anything amazing."
31920,Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice,"I found this game to be extremely enjoyable. The story is interesting, with a lot to learn about through talking to the other people (or snooping through their stuff). Each of the characters have their own personality. You also have the option to change your outfit, which then leads to unique discussions of its own. The only part is when you have to get a jewel. It is quite difficult, but fortunately you don't have to start all over if you fail. For any price on here it is well worth it."
319210,Space Salvager,"Despite some flaws i really like this game (considering the price, even more so):      +  : interesting ship's view range, makes you feel claustrofobic (you can only see the enemies within in a small cone of view in front of you, makes you watch your back when in sectors with enemies or asteroids)     +  : i didn`t check everything out yet but it seems there is a nice range of weapons/armors/shields to buy/select from (though i think that there are only 2 kinds of weapons in overall)     +  : gather materials and make your own ship (you can mix the amount of resources to achieve some customization)     +  : it brings back nostalgia feelings      -/+  : no story/campaign/etc. Personally i like this fact (short attention span here:P). It's a kind of sandbox and you can play anytime- jump ingame to finish 1 or 2 quick missions and exit to play something else or watch some tv series :P . Some people might dislike the lack of story though.     -/+  : difficult but rewarding combat      -  : can get boring fast. There are only a few kinds of missions available which can get tedious really fast     -  : still buggy. Totally playable if you save often but...  "
319230,Gold Rush! Anniversary,i bugged when i try to buy beans ? it was under the list i dont remember.i played 1 hr and half . game play has problem. passing trough to other maps have click problems. character animating ang game rendering it is easy. you should add some sun light object into the game . well i am angry because there is no autosave. i lost my 1 hr and half.
319250,Magicmaker,"The spellcrafting in this game is absolutely fantastic...probably the best I've ever seen. I liked playing with spellcrafting components in Morrowind, but the spellcrafting here is on a much higher level than that. Not only is the number of different underlying systems they put into combat and spellcrafting absurd, but they also kept it fairly balanced. I can't even begin to imagine the number of hours they must have put into debugging and rebalancing things to get it this polished.  The artwork and music are both very fitting and well done (color palette reminded me a bit of Terraria), and the programming is absolutely fantastic. All the common bugs I'm used to seeing just aren't there. For example, in super smash bros. brawl (and many other games), if you hit someone hard enough, they can fly through solid terrain because the physics engine isn't programmed to check for collisions between the start and end points each frame. In this game, you can fly faster, and will NOT travel through terrain when you reach it.  Only programming bug I can remember atm is that if you delete a saved spell while in a zone portal, you cannot see the confirmation prompt (but can still click on it). Oh, and at the end of the game after the credits, it just stays on that screen (you need to press escape and go to title screen...not obvious). Besides that stuff, there are some graphics with areas that are supposed to be transparent that are not (some look like possible texture bleeding; not sure, but one of the plant boss heads definitely has the entire background of its texture not-quite-transparent). In any case, nothing game-breaking. And the image stuff is almost unnoticeable. I'm just picky (and used to looking at dev stuff).  I don't even have any reasonable suggestions for the devs besides considering multiplayer, and possibly adding to the story if they feel like. I would love to see a magic maker 2, even if it uses all the same spellcrafting components. If this game (or a sequel) had multiplayer...I would probably lose hundreds of hours in pvp.  The game has a new game+(++) system (multiple playthroughs to reach true endgame equipment status). You unlock more slots each time you play through, exponentially increasing the number of unique spells you can craft each time. I think the max is 8 slots per spell; I will find out after my current playthrough.  In any case, I'm off to buy copies of this game for most of my friends, because I thought it was just that good.    The rest of this is just notes in case devs see this and are considering adding pvp at some point...  A few things would need rebalancing for a pvp mode to work. Your damage output is far higher than your damage taken as it stands, so you would die too quickly...unless you had 100% damage reduction, which you can do (literal invincibility...while holding still, combined with 100% knockback prevention), which would also need to be fixed. Hmm...you might still be able to die due to execution and other status effects? Not sure. In any case, some significant number tweaking would be necessary, but I don't think any of the actual game mechanics would need to be changed (besides adding a networking system...which I know is a nightmare)."
319270,Great Permutator,It's too hard to play
319280,Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm,"I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but after waiting for this game for so long now... after playing it I am a little disappointed. When I say 'No' to recommending the game, that's unfortunate because I really wanted to recommend it for my love of fighting games, but just not how it is now as it doesn't stand up to current-gen titles. I'll give my 2c on the pros and cons as I see them.  I don't mean any insult by having the cons list larger than the pros, and the development team should be praised for bringing out a fighting game with their own IP; this is just an opinion.  Pros: - Love Letter to the old-school fighters. Basic combat that is relatively easy to learn, even more so if you come from a fighting-game background. - Good Musical Arrangement. Techno-Japanese? I'm down for that! I could watch the intro over and over. - Fantastic Manga/Anime artwork. The intro is pretty cool, and the character art on the selection screens and in the story mode is well-done and finely detailed.  ---  Cons: - Too much of a Love Letter to the old-school fighters. Too basic in it's combat, and while I put that as a Pro it is also a Con. Too often do I find myself wanting to do air-dashes, air-recoveries, counters and all the more new-age utensils the modern fighters provide. - Reso-what-now? No resolution options... AT ALL. When you start the game an external-launcher will let you select windowed or full screen, but not at what resolution. Then in-game in the options menu there's no option for it either. When played in Windowed Mode it is a startling 640x480! So don't play it in fullscreen, especially if you have a widescreen monitor as it looks really rough. - Sprite Detail. Hand-in-hand with the low-res nature, the sprites don't hold their own when scrutinized closely, especially in full widescreen mode. - Character Cast. Only 11 characters. Not too much of a big deal. - Character List. You can't press down. Only left and right, which alternates you up and down through the characters on both rows. Why is this necessary? - Announcers. They put some form of 'announcer' system in the game where you can choose an announcer (who I assume are pro-fighter players) to say random things like 'Stuffed!' during the matches and pop their very rough-pixelated faces onto the screen. Too much of a disconnect during rounds. - Text. The in-game text for things on the main menu, continue screen, etc, look like they were just run through photoshop and had some basic outer-glow filters slapped on them. Minor, but seems very quick and dirty. - Menu Screen Confusion. Two arcade modes? 1st one is Arcade and the 2nd one is Story. There's no help-dialogue when you mouse-over them to let you know, so that could be changed to ease confusion.  There we have it, that's currently what I think of the game. So sadly, it's a No from me. A good effort, but just not enough in my eyes. I'll play some more, maybe get some more perspective, but that was just my early impressions."
31930,Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek,"Sometimes slow paced, but it had some cool secrets to discover that kept me interested. Also some of the little games were surprisingly quite entertaining and not as annoying as in some of the other Nancy Drew games."
319300,Trainz Trouble,  this game is cool
319320,Time Mysteries 3: The Final Enigma,"This game was very nice, not too har, not too easy"
319410,Duck Dynasty, This game is as fake as the god damn TV show.  The actors are pathetically EVEN MORE scripted and unbelievably annoying here than in their show.  This game makes me want to kill myself.  Thank god Cabela's didn't put their name on this piece of sh*t. I hope the company that paid millions just to have these f*cking inbred cast go bankrupt.  Go f*ck yourself!  -10/10
319430,CHAOS - In the Darkness,"this game could have been fun, if the combat system, and controls didn't suck so much.   that's how i feel.  "
319450,Chariot,"  After two years on the market, this gem of a game needs more recognition. With colourful backgrounds, a good mechanic and when going to the final levels, it can test your skills."
319470,Ninja Pizza Girl,"This was great. A challenging platformer with a cute story, awesome electronic music, and very original mechanics regarding it's 'health points'. While most games track the character's health as it takes damage, in Ninja Pizza Girl what suffers is your self-esteem, and gosh is it accurate. Those ninjas laughing at you after you tripped and fell were so infuriating at times. Which is the point of the game actually (also, punching them in the face isn't as rewarding as completing the level in a new record time. Who's laughing and streaming with ther phones now? Not me, because I'm not a jerk like you stupid ninjas). Anyhow, this was a great game. Within it's 'indie' boundries of course. Yeah, it has some visual and audio glitches at times, and I must admit the comic style is not exactly my cup of tea, but remember this was made in a kitchen! It's quite remarkable as it is. Also, as a final note, I love, love, love the family quotes in the beginning of each level. It's not just cute, but it shows that in Gemma's young mind her family is the greatest source of wisdom and advice. And I can relate to that. I think we can all relate to that. Great job developers. Now keep on running before the pizza gets cold! "
319480,Odallus: The Dark Call,"i requeted a refund. i played it for a bit, its not fun. one main thing that killed it for me is the sound and music. And an other gripe I have is the screen is way to small. if the item screens wernt in the way I feel that would help alot. everytime you encounter an enemy that just appear instantly, and for a platformer game weres the fun if you cant see a good amount of the platforms to jump too."
319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,The 12 year olds absolutely ruined this game.
319560,Reprisal Universe,"Reprisal Universe will probably be too slow for those who didn't grow up with Populous - strategy / god games have moved on a great deal in 25 years.   However, to those who did grow up with it, Reprisal Universe will be second nature.   Having grown up with Populous on the SNES, was was very happy to find this game. The mechanics are really no different, which will dissappoint anyone expecting something new or innovative, and please anyone hoping for a blast from the past.  It has the same mesmerising feel Populous inspired - which I imagine is the flip-side of the boredom some of these reviews talk about.  So, in short, for those missing early 90s ambient god wrath, this really is a must."
319570,Heroes of SoulCraft,"Im not reccomend, coz low graphic, bored game, etc"
319630,Life is Strange™,"Awesome story, good music. Plays like a TV show, its pretty simple and has a lot of choices you can make. Favorite game I've played this year, can't wait for episode 5."
319740,There Came an Echo,"Great idea, nice jokes. good voice acting... uncany valley on voice commands. great idea, works 75% of the times, but that hard part of the game is the 25%, and it will fail.... a little more tech and maybe.  Also VERY irritating unskipable scenes."
319760,Oh My Gore!,Rather expensive for what it is. Your basic tower defense game with a splash of blood and sending minions out to attack.
319780,Airport Simulator 2015,Nice but gets boring pretty fast.
319830,AX:EL, Early Access Review
319850,Bridge Constructor Medieval,Pretty cancer.
319910,Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power,"Seemed kinda short, and stopped in the middle of the story?! Coop-play was kind of linear and buggy, with controls being difficult to aim/maneuver.   The biggest issue was that I remember in Trine 2 there were lots of areas where two people, or at least two different characters, were required to progress. Here it seems like it can all be done by anybody."
320,Half-Life 2: Deathmatch,A cheap uninteresting multiplayer afterthought that dares carry the title 'Half-Life'
32000,Raycatcher,"AVOID AT ALL COST, WHY IS THIS STILL ON STEAM?  cant even pause it. A few years ago the developer potentially had me writing good reviews about this.... file (I wont call it a game), apparently his programming buddy has gone awol, and this game has been left in the disasterous state it was released in. I would call it a cashgrab, following the success of audiosurf, and while I really wanted to like it, it is complete trash.  2/10, pros: small file, quickly removable, at one point it had promise.  cons: all the rest."
320040,Moon Hunters,BEST GAME 2016
320090,This Starry Midnight We Make,"This is very much a first-impression review. The game just couldn't get me interested for longer.  It's a slow-paced and rather boring puzzle game, gating a slow-paced and rather boring storyline.  I am also not a fan of some of the art design. The pond, where you'll spend most of your time, just isn't easy on the eyes. Nor are the kimono with shifting patterns that many characters wear."
320110,Train Town,Terrible game. Worth $0.
320120,Meadowland,"PROS: - everything is handdrawn - nice reallistic sound effects - beautiful little 'story' - 2 different endings - nice gamepad controls...  CONS: - ...but mouse and keyboard isn't really precise - a bit short (about 3:20 hours to complete it) - not really a game - only one resolution  RESULT: I really enjoyed the 3 hours I had with this game. It has two different endings and a short 'story' to tell. If you hear story and think about Final Fantasy, then you will be disapointed. It's more a story of life. For me a game should be paid 1€ each hour, so 3€ would be my price I would pay for this game. I bought it for 1,59€ and don't regret buying it. Of course I could now refund it, but that would only do a real jerk. ;) I enjoyed it and really recommend it to anybody who wants a great experience, not game. &lt;3 (\s/)"
320140,Absolute Drift,"If you're heavy on the throttle in racing games, then this game isn't for you. if you've paid attention to what drifters do to perform what they do and would love to try the theory you've developed by watching, than this game IS for you :-) Absolute Drift teaches the discipline of adjusting the appropriate speed, especially upon approach, between brake and throttle. Learn to master the art of drift by initiating the handbrake and identify the rhythm needed between gas and brake to harness the flow and you will melt right into this masterpiece. Like a snowboard, you should always be carving. The soundtrack is great, and I could most certainly see myself buying future DLC, which I usually am very weary of. 10/10 worth every penny."
320150,Deadlings - Rotten Edition,"All the idiots who compared this to Super Meat Boy should be vivisected with a fondue fork and it is shameful of the devs to quote not one but two reviews who use this comparison which makes no sense whatsoever.  The game has ONE thing going for it, the artstyle is nice and it looks good overall, but past that, it's a tedious platformer without the most basic element of a platformer: Control. The zombies move automatically which leaves you with 2 decisions: which direction to start running and when to jump, which makes for a fairly unpleasant experience.  All in all, not worth my time and energy."
320240,We Happy Few, Early Access Review
320300,Car Mechanic Simulator 2015,"Game is okay, spent some time with it and not too shabby though the features beyond picking and placing car parts is extremely limited. Processes in the game become obsolete as you gain money (get to the buying cars stage and you never have to go back to diagnosing or repairing other people's cars, just get yours to 100%). 4/10  As far as advertising/exploitative marketing practices go, steer clear of obviously lacking expansion packs. The new Bentley pack has 5 reviews that share similar timestamps, similar usernames, no time played on the game, and all positive statements. Buyer beware."
320310,World Truck Racing,I made it first place but got last place. Uninstalled.
320320,Darkstone,"Game sucks. Anyone who compares this to diablo 1 2 or 3 needs their head examined. It is far too old and decrepit to be enjoyable by about 10 years. Seriously, if you think this is fun on any level- go use your social security and see the Dr..."
320340,Cosmonautica,"PROS Its an interesting idea. Nice artstyle. Ok music.   CONS Game is pretty buggy, crashes a lot (not a lot of lost progress cus of autosaves but still annoying).  Fighting is unbalanced, and its pretty boring, the enemies in the starting zone are way to strong, most of them imposible untill you get a LOT of upgrades, and the ones you can beat it just takes forever.  Not much to do in the game you can trade witch is a pure grind, fighting isnt much of an option in the early stages and when it is it isnt that fun. And when it comes to the misions only some types are even worth doing. "
320400,Magnifico,Very entertaining game. I liked this online version so much I bought the real board game to play. It's a great game night addition.  David
320410,Near Impact,more like rear impact hehehe
320430,Ascension,"I am really enjoying this game. It comes with a bunch of expansions and it is just fun to play. It is a little disappointing that it doesn't support higher resolution or wide screen monitors, but that is the only negative."
320540,Coffin Dodgers,  Why does this game have a 70%+ positive rating. It's horrible. Bad car handling. Graphics that look like they are from the N64. Low content. Uninspired weapons. Dead multiplayer. On PC just get Sonic @ All-Stars Racing Transformed
320590,Warside, Early Access Review
320610,Questerium: Sinister Trinity HD,"Questerium is a pretty good hidden object / puzzle game. The thing that makes it most enjoyable, however, is the cheesy, over the top acting. I found myself laughing out loud. I kept expecting the guys from MST3K to show up and start heckling the game. The puzzles run the gamut from easy to difficult. Beware, some of the hidden object puzzles have bad clues where the noun it gives you for an object to find is not really what that object is. I missed the 'no hints' achievement because I had to use a hint to find one of them. On the whole, however, this is a fun game. Play it if you want a good chuckle. "
320630,Season Match,"For the same price, there are better match 3 games available on Steam. 4 Elements immediately comes to mind. Season Match was not terrible, but I didn't feel like complexity scaled very well. The maps themselves lack the sophistication of 4 Elements, the graphics are mediocre and it would have been a nice touch for the soundtrack to change as you completed each season and help give each chapter of the quest play its own flavor."
320650,Season Match 2,"'How is it?'  'I'm fighting to match things and drive away an angry toadstool. Now I'm fighting an angry stump. Now I'm fighting an angry dragon. Now I'm fighting an angry hedgehog.'   'How bout now?'  'Now I'm fighting... um... uhmm... It's dark brown. It's shaped kind of like a teardrop? A squashed teardrop? With a funny point? But it's still angry. Definitely angry, very scary enemy.'   'Are you fighting poo?'   Still not sure but at least I won.  Recommended."
320670,Season Match 3 - Curse of the Witch Crow,"An apparently nice match 3 game with a lot of hours into it. My mom plays this game and she actually likes it a lot (I bought mostly for her).  This game is even way prettier than the first in the series. It tries to have a story, but that's not the important part here. The game achieves nice puzzles where you'll manage to spend some time into it.   Overall, I don't have a reason to not recommend it."
320690,The Treasures of Montezuma 3,"I really like the Montezuma series, but this keeps on crashing which makes the game unplayable. I have about 5 hours of gameplay and during that time it has crashed around 20 times, so if this is not fixed I won't play this no more. If only the crashing was fixed I would certainly recommend this game, however at this state I won't."
320760,Tokyo School Life,This is Poop.
320790,Fabula Mortis,so this game really can be fun and contorls feel great when playing. the only downside is not a lot of people are playing or know about this game. but if you still like alice in wonderland and steam punk you should check this game out.
320820,Toren,"Toren is a book. A wonderful 3D book. It is a perfect game for those who like short stories and an meaning behind. Reminds me children's books that has a moral behind you do not expect.  PROS: + Quality Story + Quality Art + Depth Abstraction between Life/Death meaning.  CONS: + The puzzles ins't soo difficult, i don't know if it is proposital."
320840,Wings! Remastered Edition,"This game has a lot of potential, but bad controls and poor design choices (I'm looking at you strafing runs) really hold this game back.  The voice over and the graphical updates are a welcome enhancement over the original but little else really improved for this version.  Unless you just don't care how you spend your money, hold off on this title until it goes on sale again for $3 or less."
320970,IGT Slots Paradise Garden,"It makes you feel like you've stepped into a real Vegas Casino! And although I wish I could walk around more freely, and that there were simpler slots to play (No simple 3 reels), the atmosphere alone is worth a buy! Check it out!"
321030,One Day For Ched,"This game is advertised as a hardcore game for old school gamers. Well it does look old, and by old I mean outdated. The graphics looks downright bad. In addition to that it lacks options. For instance it is impossible to change mouse sensetivity or key bindings. Audio is nothing to write home about either. The main character is poorly voiced and it is quite annoying.   As for gameplay, the game is so unbelievably hard that it gets frustrating after the first 10 minutes of playing it.   So is it worth buying? For $3.99 - absolutely not! There are so many other much better games for the same price, or even lower, that this game seems like a rip-off."
321060,Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme,Commercial is the scheme maybe to some people.It is a very fun game and nice storyline the follow.I would highly recommend people giving this game fair chance if you like storyboard games.
321080,Pirate Hell,"One huge problem . The game crashed and deleted my save data at which point I abandoned it. But I rarely give negative reviews based solely on technical issues , that is to say if the game worked properly I would have recommended it.   EDIT: On my second playtrough at the moment , backing up my save file after each tougher mission. So far so good . The dev was smart enough to include the save file location in the readme file , so Im guessing he knows about the issue.   Its a cute little pirate game. I have to say it turned out to be a lot more arcade-ish than I originally imagined , especially if played with a controller. Speaking of which the game supports xbox 360 controller , but it does not detect it automatically , you have to enable it in the options screen and it works well enough with it excluding some minor issues sometimes your ship continues to go in the last pressed direction if text pops up on screen. Gameplay wise the game is much like a twin stick shooter. Except you can only shoot fron the side of the ship , yeah no bow side cannons , or at least I havent found them. You have missions to choose from , but the game has an arrow pointing to the next mission you need to do in order to progress the story. There are also side missions that you can get from ports , at which you can also trade. Missions themselves are mainly deathmatch arena tipe , but there is the occasional convoy , town protection or even race missions. Other than that there is a slight city building aspect. You have a pirate nest which you can make better by purchasing buildings which let you buy upgrades ot give you perks. Speaking of perks , your ship has inventory slots that you can equip items in , each item giving you a different perk.  One thing I found weird is that the menus and stuff are well made but the logo of the game looks iffy , like they changed the name in the last second and needed a new logo asap."
32110,Luxor Mahjong,Really good and relaxing mahjong game
321150,Melissa K. and the Heart of Gold Collector's Edition,"There is a lot to like about this game; the navigation system is inventive, the HOG are different and the story is interesting. Unfortunately there is also a lot to dislike. There is no way of knowing what you are supposed to do at points, sometimes it really does feel random, and without the hints you would be lost. I played on the easiest setting and still struggled with what I was supposed to be doing half the time. I do love the Gecko though"
321190,Cho Dengeki Stryker,"Cho Dengeki Stryker is one of the best story experience that I have seen in a long while. It reminds me of why I love the medium of anime and manga, As an amatur writer and manga artist this has motivated me to work harder in the craft. One day I hope to write a great story as this! I would highly recommend this VN to any anime/ manga fan."
32120,Chainz 2: Relinked,"Basically just a Bejeweled clone but this time with chains. You got a few different modes like time attack, arcade, strategy &amp; puzzle mode. It's not a bad clone but doesn't really do anything different and I can't recommend it for the current price."
321260,Wickland,"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Update&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Servers are no longer up. Only able to practice with BOTS no MP. Real Shame. Only buy if you want to play with BOTS!!! I repeat MP is no more.  An interesting take on the arena style shooter, runs well on low end systems to boot. Its main issue is that even a well made 90s arena shooter like 'Wickland' can't pull gamers away and hold them. Especially gamers that would naturally gravitate towards 'Quake live' or unreal tournament, next to these the content just isn't there nor the playerbase. I'm unaware of any new low but healthy playerbase arena shooter on steam except 'Reflex' maybe? Granted apart from dabbling a little now and again in the genre, it's clearly something I don't play alot off. Playerbases also in Arena shooters especially low playerbases aren't the easiest on new comers. Good twitch reflexes and god like aiming, from the demigods within the population can alienate most of us motals. Anyway back to Wickland.  What I am glad to see is that Bots are included, its what most MP games should be including! If you are buying Wickland I recommend you pick up a few copies and gift them. Great fun to be had against friends, which should last, as long as a classic 90s style arena shooter holds interest to you or your friends. To boot it is on sale a good few times at a heavy discount. It scrapes a recommend from me, its back to a simpler time before complex FPS took over. Just remember there is next to no playerbase.  A cautionary 90% off recommend."
321270,UNLOVED, Early Access Review
321290,Dandelion - Wishes brought to you -,"Super precious stat-based otome~ The art is very aesthetically pleasing and there's only ...perhaps a handful of typos. They do not really break immersion other than 'breath' when it should be 'breathe', heh. I enjoyed the voice acting a lot and I'm glad I did not have to buy it separately. I definitely suggest it for otome fans, as I was skeptical of buying it for a long time."

321360,Primal Carnage: Extinction,"New Review(beginning 2017 Review): I waited quiet a long time to come back to this game to see if the Dev's would make some new improvements to the game.  Happily, i take back my prior negative review about the earlier development of the game, as much has been done to fix the issues. the game has become more balanced, the dino's feel and control well, the humans, again, feel and control well too. before both classes were either too fast, too slow, but now they feel just right, and the balances made to each class makes it so that the other can have fighting chances once again.  i can say for sure now this has become a primal carnage game, and i'm pretty shocked and surprised to see how its evolved with the introduction of community skins being added into the game to become unlockable rewards. in honesty its a plesant addition to the game.  there are still some minor tweaks i can see so far that need adressing. some debuffs to the commando class launcher, buffs to the spino and arco mouth box, dino eating issue for tyrants needs to be looked at, as you have to stand right on top of the carcass and look down to heal, gathering ammo and healing needs to be revised a little as i notice it doesn';t always show up until i look right at it as a human class.  other than that the game is starting to look pretty complete. i'd not be surprised if it would be offically released this year.     Original Review(Negative/initial year release Review):   I get that this game is still in early access, and that it still has a lot of kinks to work out, but each time I come back to see the changes, I'm honestly not seeing much improvement, or for that matter, improvement that makes this FEEL like a Primal Carnage game.  Even though I meet the spec requirements with flying colors, you really can't play this game without the over use of bloom effects that pretty much makes this game as violently bright as Halo 3 was. But at least Halo 3 was on a console that could easily tolerate the load, where as my poor system can't seem to keep up with it, and trying to play this on lower quality just sucks the life out of the game even more.  I get that they are trying to be more realistic with this game, than they were in the first in terms of movements, okay, cool. But you can't expect positive reception with what you are doing when there is a pace to the game people already liked from the very first game. To me things were more intense in the original, and rightfully balanced in that people were slow, and dinos tended to be quick and hard to escape than they are in EX.   Everything at first In EX was overly fast, and everything was completely wrong with the Dino AND Human class, and now that i have come back recently, dear god do the dinos feel soooo obnoxiously slow, and how i HATE with a burning passion how quickly any of the dinos stamina runs out. Rexes and Spinos seem like they have more fat on their body then they do muscle with how fast their stamina depletes, and don't even get me started on the Carno's, how clunky and slow they move unless they are charging, which, mind you can't last you to save your life because it runs out faster than the tyrants, that makes no sense. It's honestly been made easier to play a human than a Dino with all the negatives swirling about on the Dino side of things.  Not to mention all the lag. the game lags so horribly from all the plant life, and bloom effects it has to load that, I can't pounce as a Raptor when the ping increases with each player, can't nab anything as a Tyrant, cant fly as a Petra, and, well frankly I don't bother with the carno anymore because I just find no joy in it what so ever as I did in the first game.  So thank god this game was only a few bucks for me, because of having owned the original before this game opened for Early access, because it really isn't fun, and feels nothing like the original at all. just a pretty upgrade with crappy gaming mechanics and functions. I likely wont come back to play this game for a long, long while, and if i do come back, we will see if i can reverse judgment."
321370,Sign Motion,horrible 
321390,Zone 22, Early Access Review
32140,Midnight Mysteries: The Edgar Allan Poe Conspiracy,Pretty basic hidden object game but enjoyable. You can't wonder around freely so you won't get lost Hog levels looks good and sometimes can be quite challenging. Nice game for one sitting of relaxed gaming :)
321400,Supraball, Early Access Review
321410,Command: Modern Air / Naval Operations WOTY,"This over-priced piece of software is misplaced in the games category here on Steam. If you would put about 100 variables in an Excel sheet and make them interact with each other, you would get the same slow performing abomination as this. Horrible to say, I find no joy in having spent so much on something that was so distasteful, like a culinary expert accidentally stumbling upon a fast-food restaurant where they spit on your fries and burger. I thought that within this software, I would have the ability to customize everything - including the creation of my own vehicles, this alas cannot be done. The most unfortunate thing is that I bought this game before the steam refunds were introduced, as I would gladly receive my money back for a product I used for 0.6 hours in total. I might alter this review after having met success with support regarding my experience."
321450,Aquadelic GT,"I was expecting something between Water Race and Riptide GP, and instead I got some water racing where what matters the most is the weapon/nitro you pick up during racing. As Mario Kart or similar game, you can race as good as you want but you will still be wrecked by these bloody weapons. Not what I expected."
321480,Sigils of Elohim,"This is a good introduction to The Talos Principle's tetris-like puzzles. This game even gives bonuses to use in that game. BUY THE TALOS PRINCIPLE, but try this game out first and the Talos demo to get the full experience."
321490,MotoGP™14 Compact,"3. Nov. 2015 hmm, i can not get this Antialiasing to work. not with game config, not with selfmade game config, not with overwrite in amd driver. only this game looks ugly with flicker graphics. i saw other people had the same problem long ago. 11.2016 graphics still ugly to watch"
32150,Everyday Genius: SquareLogic,"This is fun, and at later levels, makes you think more. I really enjoy it. Only basic math knowledge is needed, and some logic."
321540,MODO indie 901,"This is a great product at a perfect price. Flexible and cheap rental as well. Limitations are understandable, and I think The Foundry haven't overly crippled it (hear that Autodesk Maya LT!). Although I think limiting poly export is a bit silly. Although I haven't fully explored Modo Indie, as a professional 3D Artist, this is the software I would recommend to any Indies or freelancers."
321560,The Sun and Moon,while its a fun platformer i dont believe its worth the price. wait for a sale but overall i feel like this game fun in small chunks. i doubt you can play it for hours its good for a few minutes here and there which is why it felt much like a mobile game rather then on pc. the reason i recommend this game is because is does what is says it does and what is does is done well. if your looking for a puzzle platformer this is a good choice. but maybe wait for a sale drop.
321600,The Flying Dutchman,This is DOA and should be removed from Steam. The game performs a check on either an ancient version of Internet Explorer for Java plugins - it prompts with an error if it can't find 'Java' even if you have it installed.   There's no developer support for this bug and the game will not launch under Windows 10. A few people have complained miserably in the Steam forums but there's no help there for those poor souls.  Maybe if you have a legacy computer?  Gamebreaking launcher bug and *zero* developer support - no way this can be recommended. It does not run.
321610,Demonlisher,"Demonlisher is ugly, and the gameplay may be original, but it doesn't feel like it: run around and shoot monsters while collecting stuff. This game wasmade back when 640x480 was still a thing and 3D was cool (and it would have been ugly even then); today, anyone would whip this up in 2D in Flash and make it actually playable and enjoyable and nice to look at. In the big lottery that is the bargain bin, this game's a dud. Don't waste your money."
321710,Battle Of Europe,Flying the planes is one of the most enjoyable experiences on Steam.
321800,Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition,"Back in the day, I played Baldur's Gate 2 and loved it. I also played Bioware's Neverwinter Nights games and loved those even more. Somehow, as I was making this modern day Steam purchase, I didn't realize that Icewind Dale was going to be a throwback to the BG engine. And it sucks. The voice acting is horrid, as you came to expect back in those days, and the plot draw is just as bad. It even starts out with the stereotypical 'adventuring party in a tavern' scene. Wtf?  Most of all, I hate the difficulty scaler. There's normal - which massacred 2 parties within the first mission I played, then easy, which grants some more leverage, but still ended up with a massacre to a party I custom generated that wasn't totally combat ubered out, and then there's 'story!' Your party members are invulnerable! No in-betweens! wtf! I didn't ask for god mode, just cut me some slack when I don't want to play the combat god-mod oriented game. Feh! Lame.  TL;DR Don't buy this game if you're expecting it to be like BG or BG2"
321830,Cavern Kings, Early Access Review
321840,Rising Angels: Reborn,"At the beginning, I thought this game was an RPG that had a REALLY LONG starting cutscene, but it turned out that it was an interactive storybook. I do not reccommend this game if you don't like reading rather corny dialogues, as it has a LOT of that. also, just to give you a fair heads-up, this book (not game, as it isn't a game, it's just a digital book with a trivial choice here and there) is fairly short and very well-worth the time spent to play it. which is about...oh....maybe two or three hours? it took me about seven, but I click slowly, so....yeah. the soundtrack was mostly boring, but one song was WAY too 'action-packed' for a book like this. the presentation wasn't entirely what I had hoped for, and the characters lacked the level of depth that I am used to. Not to say this book was BAD or anything; I rather enjoyed it. It's just that it seems rather...lacking. still, not bad for free. when I finished reading, it said I had 'ending three'. implying that there are at least three endings. I rather like multiple ending-stuff, actually....however, I am still yet unsure whether or not I'll hit that 'uninstall button' yet. Playing as a special operative named 'Natalie', I find it odd how you almost never get to see the main protagonist, beyond a facial portrait. Still, I decided to stick with it until the end, because I don't leave things unfinished.  As for this book, I am thoroughly unimpressed, even for a 'FTR' book. (Free-To-Read.) it wasn't as bad as MOST novels nowadays, but the storytelling was dry, the tense action-parts had no excitement, the mystery-parts had almost no challenge, et cetera. I do not wish to give any spoilers, in case you want to try, then please, be my guest! go ahead. it costs nothing, and was a minor amusement while it lasted. but I'll have slightly lower expectations from part 2. I was expecting an RPG, because everyone was calling it an RPG when they reccommended it to me. what I found instead was a use for a windowed operation to be running while I do resolution tests for my monitor, and RP-chat with friends online in the background. Sadly, I cannot think of any 'good points' for this book beyond that the main protagonist, the aforementioned 'Natalie', is slightly visually attractive. but if I wanted 'attractive visuals' and 'eye-pleasing female protagonists', I'd go watch the Vocaloids do their thing. It DID have some nice artwork in it, however....again, not saying much."
321870,Silence of the Sleep,"This game was 100% amazing. If you are into story driven games then this game is a must, dont spoil it for yourself by watching walkthroughs etc. The artistry and sillouette style of game play is massivly enhanced by the fantastic soundtrack. Granted some of the problem solving can be slightly dragged out and difficult but at the end of the game you will agree that its worth it, oh and watch the end credits as theres a surprise at the end! There is only one thing I can really complain about this game and that is its dire need for a sequel, I am hoping there is one in the works because a game this fantastic demands it! Great job Jesse and love to see your future work."
321880,Aveyond 3-3: The Lost Orb,short yet fun game had a blast playing it felt like a classic rpg
321890,Aveyond 3-4: The Darkthrop Prophecy,"The story was good, and the mechanics have vastly improved over the previous games in the series. The places we've previously visited in all the games were unavailable, which could be good or bad. It was getting repetitive to revisit the same places over and over, so the new places were a welcome change. However, one of my favorites parts about this series is the ability to go around collecting animals for Moo Hatchery. Not being able to even visit it took a lot out of the experience for me. And since this was the last of the series, and they just added new areas while keeping the old in the other installments, I think it would have been better if they had at least let us visit the old areas even if there were no missions there.  So, it was fun, and more polished than the others. But they could have done better in tying it to the rest of the series. "
321920,Schein,"This game could be so much better, but it's not. Only thing I really liked is the background music and visual style of the game. Everything else is bothered from other games, like Limbo or Alter World.  Controls are hardly playable on keyboard, checkpoints are badly done, you are losing collectibles when you die between checkpoints and that sucks, voice acting is poor and story is not that interesting. I could hardly believe that main character was looking for his son and not viceversa.  FInal result:    4/10"
321940,Moorhuhn - Tiger and Chicken,simply fun game and looks beautiful
321950,Yury,  so hard to control
321960,Might & Magic Heroes VII ,"You get the classic battle system with new and interesting monsters, and the new hero skill tree system was suprisingly interesting. Each faction is fairly well balanced, so starting a new campaign with all the different factions is fun and worthwhile.   9/10"
321980,Hardland, Early Access Review
322080,Disorder,"Disorder has some very stressful gameplay! I just beat it and I do not have all the Steam Achievements (actually, I only have two of them). -- However, I think that my experience is still a valid one. Without any spoilers, I will have to say that the story confused me a little while all the easter eggs kept me intrigued in whatever was going on. The game has a certain ambiance that becomes more prevalent as the game proceeds. Honestly, the last stage took me by surprise and even had me on the edge of my seat! (Definitely bringing on the horror vibe that reminded me a lot of Eversion.)  There are only minor issues like platforms having random paths that make it more difficult to jump at times. As well, I had an issue with some stages that had the bouncing platforms. But, I would have to say Disorder is an experience that a hardcore gamer might love -- all stresses included! I am a casual gamer so I found the gameplay a bit tedious at times. But, having as short a playtime as it does, the torture is not something I regret. The levels built off of one another which is shows good planning on the developer's’ part. I went into this game blind so these are just my honest feelings. As an aside, I really liked the alternate choices offered throughout the levels. (They really helped out when my weak resolve for advanced puzzles kicked in!) I also like the hint of an alternate ending.  TL;DR: I felt some kind of way but I recommend playing it if you love hardcore platformers/ horror/ the indie game element/ and being stressed out of your mind. It isn't terribly long and I recommend putting it in your inventory!"
322110,20XX, Early Access Review
322130,Disney's Princess Enchanted Journey,The single best game I've played in my entire life. The plot is so in-depth it had me in tears multiple times throughout the story. The gameplay is as smooth as it can be and the graphics are absolutely breathtaking. Definitely worth more than the measly $19.99 it asks for.   10/10 and not because I have a crush on Cinderella.
322170,Geometry Dash,polargiest chooses if you wanna kill yourself or not (hint hint: its always you wanna kill yourself)
322190,SteamWorld Heist,"Fun and Polished, would recommend."
322210,"Guns, Gore & Cannoli",A fairly mediocre and linear 'Run-to-right shooter' with a cartoonish gangster/zombie theme to it with up to four players. Should have add a score and a level up system rather then having a lowgraded cutscenes after each level.   The low price makes it worth a try.   4/10 (Add +1 to the review for adding another player)
322290,Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure,"Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure - game that every owner of PSP know. At leats they should, it would be shame if they don't. One of most interesting Playstation Portable games (even tho original released on PC in Japan) are avaible on Steam. Is it worth to get it?  In very short: yes. Why? Because it's very fun. Maybe the story, game style, characters and almost everything feels like a game made for younger gamers. Is Gurumin for kids then? Probably yes, since it's really cute and doesn't include any 'bad' elements. That doesn't mean 'adults' should avoid it at any costs. It's one of games that makes you feel really relaxed while playing, exploring every levels (and secrets!), trying to reach best possible score and learning more about monster village residents. Gurumin is really well made games and will keep you for many, many hours. I remember playing it for the first time on PSP and I had really much fun unlocking everything and playing on higher difficulty levels. Now I'm doing the same here, on PC. This game strongly reminds me for platformers and such from Playstation 1 era games. Maybe i'm a sucker for cute looking games too.  People sometimes compare Gurumin to Ys or Zelda games. I'm not sure if it's on the same level, but I know one thing - Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure have its own magical 'something' that's worth playing for. The number of items, unlockables, and overall levels to beat on each difficulty is high, so you won't end your adventure with Parin in few hours."
322300,The Repopulation, Early Access Review
322330,Don't Starve Together,keeps saying steam must be running to play this game (steam)API_Init()failed) But i have my sateam running and i have tryed restarting my pc but still the same bullcrap
322440,Red Goddess: Inner World,"Do not buy this game.   Having now played both the Playstation 4 and Steam versions of this game, I can confirm that it is impossible to play thirty minutes of this game on either platform without encountering multiple game crashing bugs. During my time with the Playstation 4 version I was able to soft lock the game two different ways before reaching the fourth area. The first was when I picked up the collectible Gem right after leaving the room where you got your first memory before the babysitter began her dialogue, the gate read it as a sequence break and caused my character to freeze in place. I could pause the game, but that was it. After that I reloaded the game and found various progression essential NPC’s began disappearing from the world before I could interact with them. There were also numerous other smaller graphical and collision glitches, as well as a several spelling and grammatical errors, that showed the complete lack of polish and quality control found all throughout this game.   The Steam version is, if anything, worse. The frame rate stuttered its way to an average 15-20 frames a second on the opening cut scene, and the game would freeze and stutter dangerously ever time it tried to load assets for the next area. While I was able to get further in the game then I did on the PS4, this time instead of soft locking the game just crashed to my desktop while I was riding an elevator in the Crystal Caves shortly after getting the Rage mask about 25 minutes in this time. Again, there were numerous smaller glitches and problems found all throughout the game. I wanted to like this game, I really did. But it is far to flawed to recommend, and the fact that the creators wish to call this a “finished” version makes me unsure if I want to laugh or cry. This game should not be released in this unpolished and unplayable condition. Several changes and fixes have been implemented from the Playstation 4 version, but if you must play this game I would recommend waiting until October when the Xbox One version of the game is due to be released. Perhaps third time will be the charm, though giving this game’s current track record, I doubt it.  "
322500,SUPERHOT,"Clever gameplay design and a barely-engaging story don't justify the pricetag given the short length of the game. See it on sale? Sure, get it. Its worth it. As it stands, however, I wouldn't recommend paying full price. The post-game content is only fun enough for a minor distraction - maybe kill ten, fifteen minutes - but after that the only option is to start a new game or find something with a bit more depth. Again, the gameplay is clever, and an absolute blast, but it falls short."
322520,Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,This is more of a RP haven for fans of the series. If you're interested in the series try Dynasty Warriors 8 XL. I'd only recommend this to hardcore fans or when on sale.
322540,Galactic Inheritors,Far to shallow and unpolished. Not worth your time.
322550,Standpoint,"Bargaining 1 remains broken despite 3 'fixes' to the final puzzle still remains impossible to complete even following the devs instructions for how the puzzle works, 3 strikes you're out, sorry. I need a game to be completable to be able to recommend and that puzzle is just broken entirely despire 3 requests to fix where you've supposedly fixed it every time."
322580,Dungeon Lurk II - Leona,This sucks
322630,Mind Zero,"Most boring game I've ever payed for. As a fair warning: Don't buy it, because its a waste of your time and money. It doesn't get interesting as time goes on either- It simply gets worse. The graphics are very nice, and the fight mechanics are fairly interesting. However, the story and voice acting (mainly English voice acting) isn't really good at all. I would try a different approach to the story line. That might help."
322680,BLACKHOLE,"If you are looking for a hardcore platformer, Blackhole should be on your list."
322770,Vanishing Realms, Early Access Review
322850,Pro Cycling Manager 2015,"Nice game, but not as realistic as i imagined before. Quite nice to see them racing and managing the whole team on your own."
322900,"War, the Game","Im rating it good for the simple reason that i love the game, by the time i write this reveiw hower, IT HASNT BEEN UPDATE FOR LIKE 5 MONTHS. PLEASE UPDATE GAME.....    *liked level editor historical nations WW3 workshop support  *disliked the levels are too easy/hard the game is dead and its a bit too simple (i.e add more unit types) like artillary or something to spice the game up  overall 4/10 its failing pretty hard, DO NOT BUY"
322910,"Warhammer 40,000: Regicide",Chess with guns... What's not to like? 
322920,theHunter: Primal,well my stuff has been taken twice now from the server so i'm done with this till there's an update. don't buy this game !
322930,aerofly RC 7,planes - good helis - acceptable multis - bad
322950,Pure Hold'em,&gt;plays 10 games. &gt;55 in the world. 9/10.
322970,Subject 13,"To be honest, this game isn't bad at all. It's just hard. But with other famous games they have Guides and Strategies you can look up online, this game doesn't. So it's just hard but you have to deal with it alone. I just finished Chapter I &amp; II in 90 mins and already found it's that hard. If I had more time I would love to play this game more in the future. This is a really good game I really like it. It deserves more than this. If you like to challange, this is the game because it's hard."
322980,Gods vs Humans,I buy it and now the game is broken -_- i am so sad i cant stand it .
322990,Black Viper: Sophia's Fate,it freezes up constantly. and you can't play game ! the game is just full of bugs so to say. not worth the effert or money. won't let you click on objects either.
3230,Genesis Rising,"Using the fixes mentioned in the discussions section of the game I managed to get the main menu working, which allowed me to adjust the usual things located there such as graphics, sounds, etc. and look at the possible tutorial/campaign missions you should be able to play.  Sadly the slightest adjustment in the graphic options will result in a flurry of error messages (which I ignored while starting up the game) and trying to launch a tutorial, campaign or skirmish will promptly crash the game.  -2/7 Not enough sci-fi space battles"
323020,Destructamundo,"Short snippets: Read the full review at   Osho Robo  [oshorobo.com]   DESTROYING  FOR THOSE YOU LOVE  BECAUSE.  A simple click sets off a warhead, creating a circular wave of destruction. The explosions are reminiscent to those familiar with ‘Missile Command.’ Perfect timing in launching these warheads creates a chain reaction, blowing up an entire rotating planetary system’s cities or at least that’s the goal. You’ll be wise to plan your shots as eradicating a planetary system with a single warhead, garners the collection of triangular gems. These gems are use to acquire power-ups and presumably, save your species.  While this mayhem and destruction can be overall enthralling, Destructamundo became a chore halfway through. Level progression stalls if you do not collect the necessary resources to gain the power-ups as certain levels cannot be completed without said power-up. This back tracking through previous levels seems forced as, in most cases, the player may not be able to clear the necessary levels with a singular warhead. Not only that but collecting the triangular gems seemed random or broken. Swinging the mouse after clicking a gem seemed to be the most effective in collecting gems en masse. A single click would only net you a single gem or a small surrounding cluster. Mind you, you only receive one click, leaving all the uncollected gems floating lonely in space. The banter between your alien higher-up in the beginning of each level, while light-hearted, can leave you confused. The dialog tends to be strange one offs at the attempt at humor. A chuckle can be heard now and then but the humor inside adds little.    Osho Robo  [oshorobo.com] "
323040,Laserlife,"Basically, DJ Hero Octodad."
323060,Tharsis,"The random nature of the game may seem frustrating at first, but it only takes a couple games to learn how to mitigate risk in this game. I beat it on 'easy' on my second try, and already started unlocking new pilots. While I'm probably not going to keep playing, now that I've seen the good &amp; bad endings, I did enjoy the overall experience. Worth about an hour or two of playtime, easily! Get it on sale."
32310,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Classic early scumm style adventure. Worth playing.
323220,Vagante, Early Access Review
323240,The World II: Hunting BOSS,"I had a lot of fun playing this, which is why the episode is longer than usual:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUi0jYlYCo0  "
323270,Jane Angel: Templar Mystery,"This one is a miss. The story seems like it could have some potential, but the spelling and grammar are both awful enough to distract you. The hidden object puzzles are pretty straight forward and easy, and there isn't really much movement or progression. The game is broken into chapters and you basically click a scene, complete it, then click the next scene, etc. There are much better HO games out there. If you're desperate for options, or find this one for a buck, give this one a shot; otherwise I'd say it's worth skipping."
323280,Sea Legends: Phantasmal Light Collector's Edition,"Whilst the story isn't all that original, this is a fun way to spend a few hours. The ending was pretty cliche, but the game itself was fun, didn't find any bugs and it all made sense."
32330,LEGOⓇ Indiana Jones™: The Original Adventures,I can't even get passed the first level cous of a bug so I wasted 20€ on this :/
323320,Grow Home,"Fun game, work the sale price without a doubt. The only problem is that it only supports a single save, so my wife has to wait until I'm done with the game before she can start."
323380,The Magic Circle,This game should be named 'The Molyneux Simulator'.  Fantastic game so far :p
32340,Loom,A lot of people like this one. I think it's the worst scumm style game of the lot. I didn't like the art or the songs you play or the environments. It seems too far out there.
323450,Alphadia Genesis,"This game is beautiful and strory is truely rich. It's a nice challenge, like FF XIII with an Easy and Normal diffuculty.  It has 20+ hours of Gameplay. Sometimes the dungeons look the same, so you may get lost while you are in the dungeon. Other than that the game is great.  9/10"
323460,Raiden IV: OverKill,This is a must have for any fan of the Raiden series. I am surprised how cleanly it runs on my low-spec laptop.
323470,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE,Nice game but the new one is better
323490,Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana,"A wonderful story with complex charaters! I enjoyed how each route added something different to the overall lore and the world around it. If i had one negitve thing to say about it is that at the end of the routes there wasn't any choices, so it went stright into non-stop reading. But still, a great visual novel"
32350,STAR WARS™ Starfighter™,This game's controls has not aged well.
323580,Jotun: Valhalla Edition,"not for me :) the gameplay mechanics is a bit too simple when it comes to the combat, getting rooted and the slow pace of it wasnt too fun. the story telling is done in a langauge i can't quite set my finger on, which is sad (since i do understand most nordic langauges) and i do think that since it is a full story driven game you should hold more to a langauge which can be understood ^^  the artwork is beautiful and i like that you play a warrior women. the music i heard was decent as well ^^"
32360,The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition,"This is a classic. Certainly, I have nostalgia for the old-school graphics, but I'm pleased to find that the zany humor amuses me as much now as it did when I was 12 or so. I &lt;3 this game."
323620,eden - 3D Screensaver,I knew better. Why did I buy this?
323630,Ubinota,"It's an okay problem solving game, but it seems that certain achievements are literally impossible unless cheating. Devs have changed the levels and paint amount so you can't get all of them. After some levels, certain challenges are impossible to do the normal way and require you to find the right combination of blocks with physics.. and solving the challenges that way doesn't seem very realistic. Blocks should be falling without support, but somehow a group of blocks can stay balanced even if supported by a single block under it (on the side or where ever)  7.5/10  Edit 10/13/2015 - Changing to 'Not Recommended' because achievements are outdated, gameplay is boring overall and certain levels are very frustrating to figure out because of physics."

323680,Caffeine,   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR1Mb-y2sWQ  'Maybe with a few updates this game might be alright but at present I'm not going to be drinking coffee to try and stay up and play this all night' Watch the video for more information.
32370,STAR WARS™: Knights of the Old Republic™,"I like this game, used to play it quite frequently in the past unfortunately there are still some graphic issues with win 8 had to do a lot of research to get it to run ok and i am still unable to run it at max settings without it crashing i would only recomend if you are running an older os like xp."
323700,Poltergeist: A Pixelated Horror,It wasn't as good as I expected it to be
323720,Decay - The Mare,"We have here: A point and click game, set in first person with ,,stuck screens'. Instead of moving around you click to move and turn around. With only few [random] puzzles and items to pick up though, don´t get fooled only because its publisher is Daedalic Entertainment. The first person feature in this game is quite unique, what´s missing are the puzzles. And it is a bit annyoing that, when moving through a door, you sometimes do a 180° [Turn around, basicalyl]. And it´s even more annoying that many of the solutions include you getting into a room and then out for a random event to happen. That gives you the feeling that you´ve missed something, but in reality you only had to leave the room. Atleast you can get hints if you are stuck. It´s only really unsatisfying if you have to use them too often. In addition, voice acting would have been neat. It´s akward that the main dialogues don´t have recorded voices, because 2 articles have.  But what I can say is: Atleast the story is going to make sense at the end. That´s nice. But, did I have fun? Hm, a bit I guess. There just wasn´t too much too it. Consider this as a positive review if you are interested."
32380,STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II,"Yes, it requires some extra legwork to get it setup on a modern computer, but there are thankfully guides in the steam forums to help you do this. I'm not going to let the initial setup alter my review in any way, this is just a warning that if you're not IT literate enough or patient enough to play with a few files and look through some forum posts then don't get this because it doesn't play nice with new PCs out of the box.  Ok, so onto the game:  Fast paced really fun shooter: check Also has lightsaber: check (after a few levels) Causes you to occasionally think: check  Basically for those enjoying the throwback style of the new DOOM, if you want the speed, hidden secrets, mini puzzles and combat and can cope with 20 year old graphics, then get this. The gameplay is still top notch (once you redefine the keys and un-reverse the y axis on the mouse :) )"
323850,Move or Die,10 out of 10 would not stop moving again.
32390,STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith™,"I've been able to get most of the JK games working but not this one. Tried everything, but it would either crash after the first cutscene or wouldn't start at all."
323900,MoW: Face Off M,"Game looked great and playing the tutorial was great. However, there is only PVE and base cards. Cannot go online to earn rewards or advance in any way. No developer website and it appears the game is abandon. Too bad, it seemed this game had some potential."
32400,STAR WARS™: Dark Forces,They should remake this game with better graphics like they did with DOOM(TM) but it's still a 10/10 game.
324070,iO,  this is a perfect game
324080,Rising World, Early Access Review
324090,Football Club Simulator - FCS #21,This devs are obviously not going to solve the 'quit to desktop' issue; i have given them more than 4 months to solve this issue but im not going to support them anymore. My review is now negative; they haven't solved a sh*t and they don't do anything about it.. I'm sorry but you are irresponsible and your game is full of bugs; this is not even an Alpha and you label it as a finished game.. shame on you.  ------------------------- OLD REVIEW Game still have some bugs (like shutting down during 2nd season). But im sure they will work around it and solve it asap.  I liked it so far; it's more arcade than simulator and i am not looking for a too complex game such as FM16. -----------------------------
32410,Lucidity,"Art looks greats but gameplay fails in the most frustrating of ways. Not very intuitive. Failure doesn't feel good; it feels annoying because the blame goes to the programming, not me as the player. Play it, you'll see what I mean."
324110,Moto Racer Collection,"Great games, but a not so great set up. If you have the time to fix a few issues in order to get the games working, I highly reccomend, because these are some of my favorite racing games ever since I was little, but only buy when it's on sale."
324140,Kalimba,"Bought a couple copies of this game because its description said it had both local coop and coop, sadly there is no online coop in this title.  While it may be a great game, I cant recomend it for anyone looking to get an online coop experience."
324160,CLANNAD,"Awful voice acting, the characters look and sound like cockroaches, no inklings of nudity within the first 10 minutes, what a waste of $20. Refunding."
324170,Pyrite Heart,"4/10 I really couldn't get into this. The main character is your typical Tsun-dere and she is quite tiring to play. This game just seems really bare bones without enough substance to keep me interested. There are far better games of this type out there. I don't regret buying it exactly, because if you're really into these style of games and you have nothing else to play, why not? If there are other games out there, play those first!"
324190,CodeSpells, Early Access Review
32420,STAR WARS™: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes™,Buy this game if you hate your self or want to make fun of it with a friend.
324260,VoidExpanse,"UPDATE: I have seen very little progress  Old Review 2015 I look forward to watching this develop, great start!"
324270,Revenge: Rhobar's myth, Early Access Review
32430,STAR WARS™: The Force Unleashed™ Ultimate Sith Edition,"Has compatability issues with a fair number of graphics cards. Should have done my research. Didn't work for me.  Ultimately, the game is pretty good, but I recommend the console version unless you have double checked that it works with your graphics card."
324310,Bus Simulator 16,"Was told about this game from a few friends and was told it was a much better alternative to omsi, I bought it and have had nothing but problems from poor frame rates and graphics quality.   I wouldn't advise anyone buying this if you are looking for a decent quality game, it lacks so much potential!"

324390,The Body Changer, Early Access Review
32440,LEGO® Star Wars™: The Complete Saga,"Just as good as I remember! Although it is more fun with a friend, playing with yourself (Kappa) is also quite decent!"
324400,Pocket God vs Desert Ashes,"This is a tactical RTS, in the vein of Advance Wars. Bottom line: not worth $5. If it were $2.50 or so, like most mobile games like this, I'd say buy it. It lacks depth.  Pros: Fun, challenging AI Graphics and art direction is interesting Game demands a mix of units to succeed, rather than just finding the strongest unit and building like mad  Cons: Campaign is not difficult enough Skirmishes mirror campaign missions Main character in story says, 'WAAAAAAAAH' way the ♥♥♥♥ too often Online play is not working at this time Low replay value  Disclaimer: I got this for free in a recent giveaway, so I didn't lose anything by trying it. Honestly, this belongs as an Android or iOS app for a tablet, not a full PC release. It could be browser-based, it's so basic."
324420,Desert Ashes,Fun game but nobody online. Anybody wanna help me with my last two achievements message me.
324470,SinaRun, Early Access Review
32450,LEGO® Indiana Jones™ 2: The Adventure Continues,LOVE IT! its fun and you can make levels like... its cool!
324510,Boundless, Early Access Review
32460,Monkey Island 2: Special Edition,Much better than the first Monkey Island special edition. Better animation + commentary from Ron Gilbert and some other guys. Doesn't have the same kind of clicking bugs that Monkey 1's SE had. The game itself is a classic.
324610,The Shopkeeper,"So, after just over an hour of gameplay I've achieved all of the achievements and gone through the different more dialogue options more times than I care to think about.  Do I feel satisfied with that hour? Not really. Would I reccomend you spend your time on this game? Not at all.  As others have said in their reviews, the purpose and intent of the game isn't entirely clear, and this lets it down."
324650,Gemini: Heroes Reborn,"I bought this because one of the giant bomb guys recommended it and it was on sale but I'm bored already. The mechanics are so clunky, half the time you hit a button and it just doesn't react. There is just no slickness to anything. Killing guys is basically stop their bullets, chuck them or something at them, and not a lot else. The travelling back in time and forward is fairly interesting, and the game had my attention at the beginning but it gets old very fast. I hate not completing games but I just didn't want to play this anymore. It's also quite ugly, despite being Unreal 4 and has all sorts of wierd bugs."
324680,Impossible Creatures,"I generally don't care for RTSes. I prefer this one to most - the joy in mixing and matching animals to create a custom army is a great conceit. Unfortunately, most of the animals come out the same, leaving most of the gameplay to behave by old tank rush stand-by. The campaign is weak, the writing poor. But there is the core of a great game here. I can't help but feel this would be more fun as a turn-based XCOM-type game, with more creature ability variety, better writing, and a modern graphics makeover. Here's hoping."
32470,STAR WARS™ Empire at War: Gold Pack,"This game is pretty cool. I love the space battles. If you like stradegy, Starwars-based, and warfare games trust me, you'll love this game."
324710,To Be or Not To Be,"This game is DELIGHTFUL. On so many levels! &lt;3 It's like Ryan North and Kate Beaton are in my head, talking smack about the Bard (in the most affectionate way, of course). Awesome."
324730,Caverns of the Snow Witch,"A great port of the Fighting Fantasy book, stuff like dice-rolling and keeping track of your stats and items are all done automatically so you can focus on the story. This one doesn't have a map though.  Caverns of the Snow Witch in particular is pretty long, maybe double the length of Forest of Doom, but be warned: this book is very unfair. Many strong monsters in this one, including an unavoidable fight against a SKILL 12 monster. Low SKILL characters have no chance of making it to the end."
324740,The Warlock of Firetop Mountain,"I'm not going to get into too much about this game. I found it too be very slow and boring. Now, that's me and what I feel about it. I do know for a fact that other people will go bonkers for this game. But it's just not my style of gameplay."
324750,StuntMANIA Reloaded,"StuntMANIA Reloaded was a game which I had conflicting thoughts on. It's fun and not serious or a pretentious game, and it feels like it was developed with attention and good intentions, however it has a few drawbacks which stopped it being as good as it could have been.  + The design is mostly consistent throughout, nothing feels out of place   + Controls mostly work well  + A throwback to games such as Re-volt, and more of a unique game today  + The aesthetics, environment design and the car models are well designed and make the game quite visually appealing and colourful  + The sound design is pretty good and the soundtrack is fun to listen to, nothing special or memorable but it works and it isn't particularly annoying or makes you want to turn the sound off. The engine noises sound like the cars actually have power behind them and each vehicle seems to have different sounds.   Negatives  - As other reviews stated, it's pretty glitchy. Most of these aren't game-breaking but some of them get pretty annoying, such as respawning in mid air and being thrown around or having small areas of ground which aren't solid.  - The car handling seems to be pretty strange, quite slippery until you collect power-ups, it seems to improve a little then but it's still quite odd.  - One level glitched and didn't have any sound playing, the sewer level glitched and some areas were without light, making it pitch black and impossible to see where you were.  -The collectables don't seem to have any purpose other than the coins, which could have been done better so that you had more of a reason to collect them.   - You can't see how many collectables you've picked up until you collect another one, making it difficult to tell later on in the level if you've collected everything.  - The game doesn't end when you collect everything so you have to manually end the game which feels strange. There's no indicator of if you've played a level before besides having unlocked it.    That said, I bought this in a bundle for cheap and it ended up being one of the better games of the bundle, and it made up for the cost of the bundle by itself."
324760,Monster Truck Destruction,"So bought this in a bundle for multiplayer... I have to say it doesn't work. Me and my cousin both selected 2 players, and it was stuck on 'searching for match' Tried playing the game for a brief while... It's awful. I feel ripped off still getting it in a bundle of 10 games for £1.39. That's how bad it is... Controls are awful... I started a championship game and well, I couldn't move!? For about 60 seconds. Had to restart it. Exited. Uninstalled."
324770,Experience 112,"The absolute WORST quest i've ever palyed. Unresponsive AI, clunky interface, game mechanics that randomly decide to not work properly leaving you wondering is that you who did something wrong or the game, abysmal loading times, nonexistant optimization with 10 fps as a norm in some areas, nonsensical puzzles. On the 'bright' side the story was interesting enough and the whole control through cameras seemed interesting. Avoid this garbage of a game unless you're mazochistic enough to torture yourself through it."
324800,Shadow Warrior 2,"NICE: Variety of weapons, beautiful setting, satisfying melee combat. VICE: Uninspired levels, enemies are bullet sponges with not much mechanical variety, procedural generation doesnt add anything, very repetitive, tons of uninteresting loot that breaks the pacing, gunplay lacks impact.  SLICE: Disappointing sequel to a great FPS, tried to innovate but it was to its detriment, action is constantly interrupted by scrolling through inventory and comparing stats."
324810,TOXIKK,"-Take all the ideas from a legendary game -Use graphics that look appealing in current time -Create good designed maps  Yep, it's basically quake remastered. This is written while using free account. I'll upgrade very soon."
32500,STAR WARS™: The Force Unleashed™ II,"Ok, I'm only two hours into the game and I already can't deal with it. The game just repeats the same mundane tasks over, and over again. Starkiller's voice makes me want to shoot someone. The cliche love story. This COULD have been an amazing Star Wars game, but the designers just didn't do what they did with the first one. The combat system is great in this game, but all the mundane tasks and litle variety of enemies per level...not to mention the quick-time events. The icons for the button you need to press is barely visable at times, which ruins the events. There's just so much wrong with this game compared to the first one. The only reason I'm recommending this game is because of the combat system, which I don't even think that's a good reason to recommend this game.   In comparison to the first game, at least the ports I've played of the first game, it lacks in what you can do with the lightsabers. In the Wii port of the game you could replace the lightsaber hilts, and I was hoping to see that in this game. While that didn't appear the dual blades did make up for it. In the PC port for the first game you don't get to customize your hilt, but you do get crashes. This game, surprisingly, crashes a lot less than the first one,  Final Rating? 5.5/10  'It's not bad, but it's not good either...' ~Game Dev Tycoon"
325060,Parallax,"The concept is good (inspiration from the Portal series it seems) but I think that the game is harder than it needs to be. Why? I find it kind of hard to keep track what the other world is looking like when I affect it in the world I am currently occupying. I think it needs some sort of 'opposite camera' as well as the player view. A toggle between these two views would be nice. The player doesn't teleport to the toggled location. The toggle just shifts perspective and disables movement as a button is held down. Once released, back to business as usual.  Despite this one flaw, I still think the game is worth checking out, but with a sale active or something."
32510,LEGO® Star Wars™ III: The Clone Wars™,"a nice little lego game with better 'graphics' than the original saga, and has nice levels and cutscenes.  10/10"
325110,Save the Furries,"It's F*cking Sh*te, Thanks for spending 2 pounds on this Brandon! :)"
325120,Notch - The Innocent LunA: Eclipsed SinnerS,"Definitely not a bad game. Just a bit disappointing, I'd say - especially when considering that there's no voice acting."
325150,Run or Die,i think this is a fantastic chilled game to play i would recommend this game to anyone in all honesty i think it should be worth more than the price given i would have said £8 - £10 for this but thats my opinion. but the challenging side of things where you have to be quick with your hands and eyes in order to pass the obstacles which would stop you from finishing.   this is the only thing thats really a con about this game which is not bad but just to give a heads up: the scenery is nice but when running through it's sometimes hard to distinguish when and where there is an obstacle even if it's just to slide underneith it because it can blend really well with the background and it's hard to say if its something you need to avoid or not.   and thats pretty much about it really but i would recommend this to anyone and i hope all those who read these reviews really buy this game it's worth the price for an indie game.    -Sixthsnipe
325160,Bik - A Space Adventure,"A fun little game in the tradition of classic comedic adventure games such as Space Quest and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, although thankfully less difficult. Funny writing, likable characters, and plenty of easter eggs to find."
325180,AppGameKit Classic,App Game Kit is a very easy way to get into programming without having to learn a complex interface or engine. Things just work they way you want them to and you are not forced to do them in a specific way. This makes it very easy to get started on your projects. And what you do instantly works on multiple platforms with little to no extra work. If you want to do everything in code and not inside an editor then App Game Kit is the solution for you.

325300,BEARZERKERS, Early Access Review
325320,Mythos: The Beginning,"Horrible. That is the kindest thing i can say about this 30 years too late flop. The controls are clunky and the game feels like a low budget 80s Commodore 64 game...the kind you play once and forget. i paid $5 for this unimaginative, boring excuse for entertainment and now i feel that the developer owes me $20. Don't waste your time or your money."
325370,Nova-111,"Simple game and beautiful enviroments. I was really skeptic at first but I'm really getting into it. Puzzles are simple (for what i've seen), so you may be dissapointed if you are looking for a serious challenge or a game heavy on strategy. This game works more as a plataformer with some unique elements on its mechanics. Getting a perfect score may get frustrating without the adition of a map, a counter or something like that...but it has animal scientists...like...actual cows, bears and cats man!!  TL-DR: Simple game, not very challengign on it's puzzles. Nice simple casual plataformer to relax. Animal scientists ftw. "

325520,Fire: Ungh’s Quest,"I like this game for several reasons. First, it is very casual which means I can stop when I need to as it saves frequently. There are no time limits or puzzles that really require fast clicking or a hurried pace. The puzzles range from obvious to decently obtuse and challenging. The puzzles aren't always what you would expect, such as having to mix music or fly through space. I have issues with spatial skills, and I feel like this game was good because it forced me to think in ways I am either not good at or don't do often.  Cute graphics, pleasant music, three save slots so you can share the game with family. My son, age 10, and I enjoyed this game a lot. It isn't long, but if you find it on sale, it is worth the few bucks."
325600,Sword Coast Legends,"I am player of D&amp;D 5e, Dragon Age Origins and Neverwinter, games that mentions were made in advertisements, the displayed content does not respect the quality of these games, videos gave to understand great freedom, but the gameplay is horrible, with unbalanced challenges, giving a beat'n up aspect makes the quest's uninteresting ... the dialogues are not in play creating a scene every damn time you talk to someone. The Master mode, which is the big difference, does not have scenarios editing, all pre made??!? ..  Hope the sacrifice of playing improve my opinion.. ..the attitudes of developers seem promising, catch the DISlike:  without improvements, false advertising and bought prizes. I tried to play several times and was unable to have nausea."

325860,Fat Chicken,"I haven't played long, but I am enjoying it. You can go back and replay levels, which is what I've been doing to get a better feel for how things work (I am in no rush to finish the game). I like the simple, colorful graphics, the ability to take time to think about what I'm doing, and to be able to press replay (I can't believe how many games don't include this!). I don't care what you CALL this type of game or even if there are others available for free. If you like the style, you'll probably like the game. :)"

326160,Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues, Early Access Review
326180,Sinister City,"Game Mechanics: The game uses extremely simple puzzle mechanics, easy as pie hidden-object-scenes (with the exception of items hidden behind interactables, which are not indicated in any way) and the overarching collectibles you need to progress the story (which can be found spread across multiple hidden-object-scenes and, as well as hidden behind the non-indicated interactables). Seriously, the game's mechanics are more boring than challenging.  Plot: What seemed, at the onset, to be a tale of a man rescuing his beloved fiancée from a wicked vampire, quickly plummeted into the lowest depths of Hollywoodesque sitcom. Seriously, the only real joke in this game is the fact that it got published.  Presentation: The graphis are grainy and outdated, the entire thing gives instructions as if it were on a tablet and the character models feel wonky and out of place (possibly because they seem to be able to magically clip through buildings).  Completion: In a single run you COULD get every achievement... but I recommend you don't get any of them instead."

326230,Smugglers 5: Invasion,"Reminds me of 2005 games. The throwback was really great. I mean, in it's current price I don't think I suggest getting this game, it's a bit not worth it but if you have a coupon (which I did) go try this out. Pretty cool game but, well. Just don't get without a coupon."

326350,Maszyny Rolnicze 2015,  ♥♥♥
326380,Mystery of Neuschwanstein,"Good storyline, interesting characters. I really enjoy playing it. It's one of those games you don't need to be constantly checking the manual to find out what to do next. It isn't super simple, you have to think about what to do next, but you can easily get immersed in the story and spend an enjoyable evening (or more) playing it. I'd definitely recommend it."
32640,Delta Force: Land Warrior,its a good game. worth checking out
326410,Windward,"The game is really relaxing and has nice graphics.  But it really lacks any depth. You can trade goods between ports, fight pirates, do quests, and capture/build some structures - which is not much to begin with, and on top of that each of these is a bit too simplistic.    Trading: Each port has literally a list of in-demand and in-excess goods that you can actually just see by looking at your map and hovering over the cities. Cross map trading is probably the most interesting since it requires you to remember what cities want, but when you travel between maps there's a loading screen.     Fighting is really simplistic - there's no aiming and only a few skills. Your ship will automatically fire on any enemies to the side, seemingly randomly picking one if there's more than one.     Questing is repetative. Quests are either a) fight some pirate, or b) go to another port (and maybe back), or c) build a strucutre (see below)    Building/capturing just requires you some basic resources (which you pick up from floating debris in the water) - and then just clicking a button and waiting for a long time.    The map is not an open world, but rather a grid of maps that you can travel between via loading screen. There's instances, but they offer nothing different - you still only focus on combat/trading.    There's various items you can equip - things like hulls, sails, crew, captains (Yea, as an item) - but all they do is change the stats of your ship a bit. The skill tree is mostly stat changes too, with a few activated skills you can invest in.  The game was interesting for a while and definitely a relaxing experience, but I feel that you learn all the mechanics in about a day, and then there's nothing interesting left to do.  Exploring really has no purpose, there's nothing unknown. There are unvisited areas, but you won't find anything unique there - just pirates and ports.  As it is, I do not recommend buying this."
326420,Sam Glyph: Private Eye!,"'I considered watching a little TV. But this one was f*ing HUGE!'  I really liked the game, I mean 15 minutes of it which we only have. Writing, voiceacting, jokes, style, noir-ish feel. I don't know what made devs abandon it, from what I saw it looks really promissing. But sadly we have what what we have and also achievements doesn't seem to work for me - got only one somehow.  Can not recommend unless devs continue the work or you want to have few laughs and got it from a bundle or on a HUGE sale."

32650,Delta Force: Task Force Dagger,"I have had this game for several years now, and have never stopped loving it. I was not able to play it for a while because of that craptastic mistake known as windows 8/8.1. There would be these stupid grey lines and the crosshairs on the scope would flicker in and out, but as soon as I got my free windows 10 upgrade I've never been happier. Anyways more about the game. If you want a good old fashion classic of a shooter Delta Force: Task Force Dagger is for you. I would recommend ANY of the Delta Force games to even my worst enemy. Task Force Dagger is perfectly done. Sure sure the graphics are out dated and it doesn't look like your Call of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Advanced Warfag, but have respect for this game. This game is pure gold, and honestly I don't think a game like this can ever be done again, by anyone except Novalogic. More about the game. You can play as one of several SpecOps teams from around the world. Force Recon, SAS, Ranger, Pararescue, C.I.A Special Activities Division.. the flippin aussies. You are Vipper 33 and you are apart of Task Force Dagger, you mission is to shoot the duck out of abeebs (terrorist, I call them abeebs) You go behind enemy lines, destroy communications, snag documents, destroy heavy weapons, all while in (for it's day) stunning maps. The maps are HUGE. You can venture off anywhere and discover new areas. Honestly once I was in the first mission I went to the terrorist command base and up on a mountain there was a whole nother facility that wasn't even part of the mission, went there... terrorist don't know how to dodge. I've gone roaming through out the world and have found random patrols of terrorist. I've discovered lakes. It's basicly kinda like Arma on the free roam Combat Mode, except all the time. It's true there aren't a ton of missions, but honestly, once you buy this game, and you play it that first time... you wont care. This game is worth constant replays. Even now when I'm busy playing BF4, DOOM BFG, all of these others, I still can't help going back to this gold mine of a game.  10/10 - Uranus 9.5/10 Pluto 9.9/10 Mars 10/10 Mercury 10/10 Earth 10/10 Jupiter 10/10 Uncle Phil 9.6/10 Grandma 11/10 Your Mom.

326520,Chime Sharp, Early Access Review
326590,Cinemaware Anthology: 1986-1991,This is a complete waste of money. Very few of these games work at all. The ones that do respond have two active buttons. This is Stone Age crap. I feel like I've been robbed.
32660,Delta Force: Xtreme,"Not played DFX for years, just bought it for nostalgia only, myself I enjoy some mindless shooting for 1\2 to an hour of fun. Lets face it Novalogic had its day with DF, DF2, DFLW ect great games in there day then with a new engine brought out BHD (Blackhawk Down) full servers great cumminity ect, then it was followed with Joint ops + esc drivable vehicles and helicopters even 100 people servers now that was great, then things turned for Novalogic downwards a game called Angel Falls never seen the light of day.Now less of the past both DFX games are sad cash ins, now thats my opinion for failing company.  pro's 1) can still be fun with friends on mp (Nostalgia sake) 2) graphics ok nothing stunning but playable lol 3) make your own maps 4) still can find sites that have mods,maps and other interesting stuff 5) Can replay singleplayer missions for better score.   con's 1) AI ♥♥♥♥, bad and mental lol 2) odd mad bugs like AI shooting through walls, nothing that breaks game though 3) Only worth it if your a fan of Delta Force games and its cheap. 4) Singleplayer is short few good missions, but repetitive at times."
326650,The Legend of Candlewind,"Short dungeon crawler (I beated that within 5 hrs including grinding time). No storyline; no interesting skill / attribute system. The worst: when I beat the final boss (which is quite cheesy) then I approach the final exit of the dungeon, it just end the game a texts box pop-up. No cut scene. Only recommend if it around $1 dollar and if you are the kind of guy who love to collect achievements (yes, I got all achievement for this game within 5 hrs. It is easy).  "
326670,Warhammer Quest,A nice dungeon crawl type tactics game.
32670,Delta Force: Black Hawk Down,This is a clasic that should live for ever!  graffic are out dated but still ok
326720,Instant Dungeon!,This game is worth every one of the 99 pennies... 1/10
326730,Whisper of a Rose,Unplayable on my machine.   UPDATE: The problem came from my NVidia video card.  You need to disable 3D DSR settings in order to play the game.
32680,Delta Force: Black Hawk Down - Team Sabre,"Another attempt by Novalogic to cash in on military popculture, this one went far better than Task Force Dagger did. It's on a brand new engine that eliminates the bug issues which plagued the previous generation of Delta Force games. While the combat is still very action-based, it's become much sharper, and the missions have returned to being based on realism - indeed, they are loosely based on actual events during the Somalia intervention, with the final string of them depicting the Battle of Mogadishu that is seen in Black Hawk Down.   The expansion are also pretty good, showcasing an anti-drug operation in Columbia and an intervention during a revolution in Iran."
326840,Heart&Slash,"A Really Lit game, the weapons you get can combo stack on top of each other, im glad i got this game a little bug where i jump on a wall and i get stuck sometimes but other than that its pretty good, i would really like a multiplayer element to this game rather soon"
326950,Sword of Asumi,Just for card
326960,Killing Floor - Toy Master,"Great mod !!! worth to buy Killing Floor, if you havent got it already          YouTube™ Video:  Killing Floor - Toy Master Gameplay Walkthrough FREE Mod&nbsp;"
326990,Deep Eclipse,Just no....
3270,Painkiller Overdose,"The game is short. Fun as the first one and the player will only experience shorter campaign. Not happy to repeat some of the levels from the first game. The game was fun to play as the devil and it started with a good map but the storyline in the end lacked and did not leave me on the edge of my seat.   I played this game because I am afamiliar to the franchise and bought it some years ago just never player it. Finally that I did, the game is filled with satanic symbolism in case you are in it for the art, be my guest, otherwise I will only recommend the first Painkiller title. Some levels were fun and love a challange for a fancy card eh? :) I recommend this in case you want to shoot the ♥♥♥♥."
327010,Motorama,"Lazy, lazy developers.  They could change few lines of code and rename 2 variables to fix critical bugs.  Game is playable in current state. But you can't drive Limited edition car and you can't change rims. I can. Because i fixed the bugs myself, but you can't.  I bought this for 35 cents only. So, i'm happy."
327030,Worms W.M.D,Super fun with friends.
327070,Gloria Victis, Early Access Review
327090,Out of Reach, Early Access Review
32710,Armored Fist 3,abrams is best tank
327140,Tilt Brush,Best VR 'Game' in my opinion. Paint menu is AMAZINGLY designed and so natural. this is easier to use than any other paint program out there.
327150,Deadstone,"Everything about this game is terrible. The game mechanics are boring, the graphics are terrible, the story is pathetic. I really cant say enough bad things about this game. I can almost gurantee you will be done after just a single play through the campaign. Honestly, I'm not even sure why I bothered finishishing the game it was so bad. I have played plety of flash games that are superior to this game. If this game was free or under $.50 it might be worth it just to kill an hour or so. But thats about it. Find something else to play."
32720,F-16 Multirole Fighter,"Usually, I can get past dated graphics, but F-16 Multirole Fighter truly puts me off. Not only the visuals didn't aged well, the controls aren't intuitive and even properly explained. No tutorial / training mode doesn't help either! The game does support the XBOX 360 gamepad to a point but you would be better of playing this game with Keyboard though. The gameplay is slow and bland/boring. The audio (sound/music) aren't that great either. Also, don't seek out this game for the multiplayer as it is quite dead! Maybe you could play in LAN but I haven't nor I am willing to give it a shot!  PROS: +Works on modern computers and XBOX 360 gamepad is supported, but barely! +Simulation seems adequate from what I played.  CONS: -Dated visuals, graphics. -Game doesn't support full screen. -Controls aren't very intuitive. -No tutorial / training mode so you are left out figuring the controls for yourself. -Boring gameplay. -Poor audio (sounds and music). -While in-game, you can't view/edit the options and even the controls. This is a nasty CON! -Dead Multiplayer (to be expected though).  OVERALL: I'm sure this game could have been decent back in 1998 but now in 2014, I prefer investing time on more modern games, as should you!  RECOMMENDATION: I would recommend F-16 Multirole Fighter to flight simulation purists and gamers that dig old school gaming only. As for newcomers, you should stay away and look into modern games instead!  Also, since you cannot buy a single Novalogic classic and 'forced' to buy the Novalogic Classics Volume One: Machines of War package, you better think twice before investing in this as I only found one game worth of purchase, Commanche 4. If you can find this package on a very good and drastic deal, give it a shot. Better, look somewhere else if you can buy a single game at a time.  RATING: 2.0 / 10"
327210,Cheesecake Cool Conrad,"The characters are cool to be. Each one is a fun option. It can be a little tricky at first when you aren't used to the controls, so I recommend using a controler but it can still be played without one. The animation is bright and colorful and you are able to remain at your most recent save after dying which is good, because some portions can be a little tricky."
327220,Anna's Quest,"Absolutely hated the ending of this game, the quoe unquote villain got screwed in being made out to be the baddie The game is slow, but think most people should enjoy it."
327260,Super Life of Pixel,"Fun game for oldskool players. Just like back in the old days, this game shows why good gameplay doesn't need to be complex and why simple graphics are not an issue when you have something called replayability. That replayability comes from classic best time lists for both the single levels and all level times combined. Hi-score liste and best time lists - that's what caused players back in the 80s to replay the same games and levels, and try and optimize your own performance. Who cares about achievements? Okay, the game also has achievements (for younger players, I suppose?), but that's really just a sidenote.  As for the game itself, you are a pixel that plays 8 levels each in the style of a 'historic' computer/console. It's basically a platformer and the double-jump feature is a nice touch. Collisions sometimes seem to lack a little bit in precision, but that's not an issue really. You'll get the hang of it.  However, there is one sad issue with this game: There's a pause bug/glitch, which you can use for cheating. The game devs don't care, which is sad, but most players seem to be competitive enough not to make use of that glitch. Otherwise I wouldn't be number 10 in the overall level times list right now. ;) So, those best times list would be a little bit more fun and increase replayability a bit further, if the devs coded a proper pause function, but oh well ... they probably didn't want to have to reset the list times, because they don't really seem to believe in the replayability of this game themselves, but I do. If they fixed the pause function and reset all the times, I would happily go on the same journey again. ;)  About the level designs and if you can actually recognize old games: There was one level which instantly reminded me of a Simpsons game. There's also a tavern called 'Joe's', so I'm probably right about that level. While I played this game on C64, this level is not part of the C64 levels.  The shop site also mentions Turrican, which is one of the most famous C64 games, of course. Don't bother looking for anything Turrican-esque in the C64 levels though, you won't find anything. Basically, the graphic style that Turrican made famous and the graphics revolution that came along with it, can't be found in any of the C64 levels. There's an Amiga level though that has Turrican in its title. I've never played Turrican on Amiga, so I can't say if that level actually is Turrican-esque. It doesn't like like the original C64 Turrican at all though.  Oh, one Master System level clearly is Sonic-esque. I've played Sonic on Mega Drive, but there's not a big difference, really. So, apart from those 3 classic games, I couldn't really recognize any of the games I used to play back in the days. Of course, I haven't played all classic games. But it doesn't really bother me that I don't recognize more classic games in this new game. The important thing is that the classics have the same charm as back then and that the sound is awesome! Now THAT is how game music should sound like!  All in all, a nice game. If you love classic platformers, you can't make anything wrong here."
32730,F-22 Lightning 3,"I am not a happy camper right now, I just downloaded $69.00 worth of games and I cannot fly F-22 Lighting I get a dump file. F-16 is to large on the screen that I cannot pick anything, it does fly but I do not know how to change the settings on the computer.  Steam I need help, Ace Combat I love, so why not get these flight simulators right?"
327310,The Marvellous Miss Take,Absolutely loved it! I've always liked games where i can run around stealing things and to find a game that purely focused on that was lovely. Nice and easy to use controls and very quick to grasp everything. Really like the art style too!
327370,Brink of Consciousness: The Lonely Hearts Murders,"Well... I played the 1st Brink of Consciousness game &amp; found it very very good. For me, one of the best HO games i've played, so I had high expectations for this one. But i got disappointed :-(, really. This one is 'casual' (in the bad meaning) in all its aspects. Technically it's ok but that doesn't make a good game. The characters are not 'at the top', the story is too complicated to be followed or believed. You find one item (usually in VERY strange places) &amp; you put it where it's obvious without more thinking. The HO scenes are correct but nothing special. The most interesting part for me was the bonus adventure where a link is made to the 1st game.  Overall i'd put a little thumb up and a score like 6/10 but maybe i'm a little bit hard with that game i don't know.  I hope the devs will make a number 3 in the series that will come back to the roots of what they are capable of."
327380,Pirates! Gold Plus (Classic),loving this. finally a game from my teen-hood i can play again!
327390,Sid Meier's Covert Action (Classic),Spent entire mission wiretapping and stalking people in my car thinking I wouldn't have to fight them in the end OHHHHHH BOYYY DID I SCREW UP (also I spent none of my four points in combat training) 3 points in electronics 1 in driving reallllll smart So needless to say I don't think I'm ever gonna arrest that guy But other then my massive struggle with the combat it's a really good game ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In another story: I already arrested one of the planners for the group and I went after their theif I checked in and they said they were in the city and to head over to that locatin So I got there Got tons of evidence on other people in the process Shots a ton of guards Didn't get shot once set of the alarm 20 times then when I found the person it turned out it was the wrong person and in that time the actual person broke into the embassy then I said screw it and broke into the MI6 headquarters and got killed the end
32740,MiG-29 Fulcrum,"Better than F-16 Multirole Fighter but slightly less good than F-22 Lightning 3. The graphical department are very similar to F-22. Controls are still as unintuitive as F-16 and F-22. No tutorial / training mode can be found in the game much like other Novalogic Fighter games. The gameplay is slow and bland/boring. Don't seek out this game for the multiplayer as it is quite dead! Maybe you could give it a shot in LAN but I haven't nor I am willing to give it a shot! Did this game improved at all from F-16 Multirole Fighter? Barely! The visuals are a tad better but that would be all.  PROS: +Works on modern computers. Also, XBOX 360 gamepad is supported, but barely, like F-16 and F-22. +Improved visuals from F-16 but F-22 are slightly better looking. +Simulation seems adequate from what I played, cockpit is well modelized, just like previous F-16 and F-22.  CONS: -Dated visuals, graphics compared to modern gaming. -Game doesn't completely support full screen as you see the window. -Controls aren't very intuitive. Same controls as F-16 and F-22. -No tutorial / training mode so you are left out figuring the controls for yourself. -Boring gameplay. -Poor audio (sounds and music). -While in-game, can't access the options menu nor view/edit the controls which that is quite unacceptable in my book. -Dead Multiplayer (to be expected though).  OVERALL: Well, barely any improvement from F-16 and even F-22. I'm not sure how this game did back in 1998 but now in 2014, I prefer investing time on more modern games, as should you!  RECOMMENDATION: Same as F-16 and F-22, I would recommend MiG-29 Fulcrum to flight simulation purists and gamers that dig old school gaming only. But in my book, you should stay away and look into modern games instead!  Also, since you cannot buy a single Novalogic classic and 'forced' to buy the Novalogic Classics Volume One: Machines of War package, you better think twice before investing in this as I only found one game worth of purchase, Commanche 4.

327400,Sid Meier's Colonization (Classic),10/100
327410,A Bird Story,Another amazing Freebird Games game. You get attached to the characters easily even though the story is about an hour long. Can't wait till the sequal Finding Paradise comes out. A must buy as well as To The Moon :)
327440,Hail to the King: Deathbat,"I figured that this being a A7X game that it would at least be done somewhat good. The graphics are like n64 graphics (which I am ok with), but the least they could do is have voice acting! It only has w,a,s,d to move, p to pause, and mouse to use magic and melee. If you want a easy game that a 4 year old can play, pick this up!"
327450,Ballads of Reemus: When the Bed Bites,Newgrounds &lt; i wish they had continued their story but since this game is more targeted to kids i guess its ok its worth the few buckerinos
327490,RTS Creator,I want my money back... its super slow... and just a mess.. Not worth it sorry.
32750,Comanche 4,I got this game in 1998 and It is a very good game. Easy to fly with a joystick and keeps you shooting.. I recomend you get the macro's so you can shoot 8 or more stingers at a time. awsome fire power.
327500,Zenzizenzic,"The visuals and music are what this game sells on.  I haven't played it much considering that I'm refunding it during the window, but I wasn't really sold by the gameplay.  Me and my hitbox didn't get along, and I wished the game had more weapon variation. It has variation in superweapons, but no real variation in basic shots, excluding leveling them up and down. From what I saw from the roguelike mode, it didn't add what depth I was hoping for.  If you reaaaaally like shoot'em'ups, bullet hells, and score attacking, you might like this game more, but I don't really recommend it. "
327510,WASTED,"For the breif time I was able to play this game it was hilarious and awesome. However at some point I started experiencing graphics problems and have not been able to play since. essentially when I'm in the safehouse i can only see in certain directions, if I turn too far either way everything goes black. I was hoping for a fix at some point but it never happened.  Still if you are able to play this game I think you will enjoy it, and maybe one day I will be able to rejoin the wasteland."
327520,Traverser,This game is great fun and doesnt even break the bank. Certainly worth a try. For more information check out the video with gameplay footage.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQmWtr9KZho 
327560,Near Death,"A short but amazingly engrossing experience. No monsters, no zombies. Just you isolated and alone against the elements trying to survive and it's intense. The core mechanics are wonderful and the game looks and sounds great. I hope the devs create more content for it like new scenarios or new bases because it's really fun game that deserves more replayability. Definitely worth it!"
32760,Tachyon: The Fringe,"Decent game, space combat is good fun, old graphics might deter a few."
327640,CaesarIA, Early Access Review
327670,Ironcast,Excellent game and worthy purchase 
32770,Joint Operations: Combined Arms,"This was my first PC FPS and the reason I saved my money to buy my first computer. Nothing will ever beat the amount of fun I've had playing this game over the past 12 years. Hopefully now that THQ Nordic has acquired NovaLogic, they could do some revamping."
327740,TRON 2.0,"Simply the most incredible first person game i`ve ever played. (played through it about 15-20 times now)  It`s really like being inside a 80`s-90`s movie. And imho it`s even better than the original TRON movie.   Very funny in a geeky way, AI always has something to say to make me laugh.  Great battles with the AI.  Great storyline, maybe the best in all games ever  Great character building of your friends and enemies, so you start to really care/hate them  Great music  Very beautiful levels, especially the Firewall and the PDA  Lightcycles how you expect them to be  Primary weapon is a frisbee  I can`t find anything to fault it except for there not being more game to play after i finished another playthrough.  Shame Monolith stopped making genious games like Tron 2.0 and No One Lives Forever, there should have been more of these funny+witty made games for us to play."

327910,7th Legion,I tried to like this but the extremely poor pathing and overall randomness of the game due to the 'battle card' system makes this more frustrating than anything.  For a good Command &amp; Conquer style game I'd recommend Meridian: New World.
327920,BloodNet,"This is the worst game I've ever played in my life.  It has some shlock value, but everything about it causes agony.  The interface is terrible and makes no sense. The dialogue is terrible and makes no sense. The story is terrible and makes no sense. The character names are terrible and make no sense.  I bought this by accident (wasn't paying attention, my fault there), and tried to play it for laughs to make it worth it, and GOOD GOD it isn't.  The combat is nonsense. Total garbage. It's like someone tried to implement Fallout 1 in VB and MS Paint.  You can walk around when exploring but IT DOESN'T MATTER. You can just pick things up and drag them over to your character and put it in the worst inventory screen I've ever seen.    UGH. RUN. RUN FROM THIS MESS.  PS, while this was originally written in a rage (the fifth one induced by this game. I have video documentation.) I think that's actually a good thing. It represents how this game made me feel: vicious and snide.  PPS I think this speaks for itself, so don't bother commenting. I've had to deal with at least one troll, and it's just a bother."
327930,Darklands,"This game is great, unfortunately is still has very old DRM that isn't made for steam, it requires you to have the old game manual and asks you a question, if you can't answer it the game just abruptly ends, I had no idea this existed and after my first run through the game about an hour or so in the game did this.  Should have been the first thing they changed when they ported it to steam, it's clear this was just a dosbox package the game for steam and then leave it supportless kind of cashgrab, wouldn't recommend"
327940,DragonSphere,"  The Good:   + Quite nice pixel graphics + Player-friendly UI + Every single item has its description, often witty :) + You can die in various interesting ways, and when you do, the game loads you back the the immediate action before it. + One of the rare old games where I didn't feel its age particularly took away from the experience    The Bad:   - Abysmal voice-acting - The plot (at least its beginning) is the blandest 'lone royal hero goes on a quest against evil mage' plot ever... - The fairies are damn annoying, with the voice acting even more so. - The game is very difficult. I'm quite familiar with the adventure genre, but I got stuck right at the beginning of each of the three plot paths. Having to consult UHS Hints for everything kinda takes the fun out of playing.    Verdict:   not an outright 'not recommended', just a kind of 'meh, not really'. Worth taking a look for the graphics, and if you like difficult point &amp; click adventures, but there are other, more enjoyable adventure games nowadays."
327950,Sword of the Samurai,not worth it

328100,Gunspell: Steam Edition,"This game is so bad, and not in a fun or funny way. You're a cop, looking for his missing sister in norml, every day city. But now you're in some strange realm fighting fantasy type creatures? I have no idea what this game is supposed to be.  Terrible writing. Random. So, so random. Makes zero sense. Bad music.  I'll be deleting this one from my desktop asap. "
328220,Wild Season - Episode 1,"3 strikes this game is out. I bought this when it came out, and today I have made my third, and final, attempt at playing it. I know people often bemoan idiotic or frugle things with video games, but this game it literally unplayable. Yea you can access a bit, and play around abit (f you don't mind things like characters flying off the screen etc), but this feels like a demo, not a game. Sad to say, but this situation reminds me a lot of Godus. Example: Wild Season has implemented the need for advanced tools since the inception, but still have not seen fit to provide the player with said tools so you are left with boulders and tree stumps throughout your farm. Also a watering can that only does one spot at a time, and there are easily 40 seeds plots, which means 9 spaces per seed plot... that is 370 clicks just for watering... don't buy this until they actually turn it into a game."
328270,Leviathan: The Last Day of the Decade,"Only played parts of it but have decided to stop playing - so might as well give my reasons.   The art is often amazing and it and the premise made my buy the game - and it holds up, or at least the art does.   But Chapter 1 was horrible in most other aspects with story I cared nothing for nor how it was told and then they kept shaking the screen constantly as to try to make the violence be real, but all it did was give me a headache.   After that I decided to try some chapters as I was on the verge on leaving and they kept the same annoying guessing games (pick the right option or reload to a previous savestate) and unegaging writing.   So I decided to stop and walk off even as I hope they are able to bring their games to the level of the art as the paintings were a marvel."
328310,Logistics Company,"Nice concept, it simulates the port terminal pretty good, but this game is bugged very serious, a ton of bugs in the game. Game builders seem don't really care about those bugs and try to fix those bugs and glitches. Pretty disappointed."
328430,Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender,Classic 3rd person point and click adventure. Not my type of game
328440,Deadlock - Planetary Conquest,"I'd read that this game locks up after the intro movie, and as it turns out, it still does. I'm glad it was on sale for $0.97 at the time. Anyone at Valve paying attention?"
328450,Deadlock II - Shrine Wars,if you crave an old school style 4X game then this might be the game for you. but i'm not recommending it due to it becoming unstable. micromanagement is tedious enough without having to replay turns. it runs for me on windows 7 after my AV UI crashes (but the core AV protection still runs in the background).
328460,Redline,Old cool bug game
328470,Slave Zero,The game for itself is good... the old school shot whatever moves with some bosses   unfortunately the game crashes often which usually happens when you attack some of those robots that look like you in later stages of game or due to some bigger explosions also the crosshair is kinda annoying you have to aim a bit lower and to the right in order to target the enemy   if you have some feelings for the game like i did (loved it as kid) just wait for some sale but for the rest i really cant recommend it

328510,Monsters and Monocles, Early Access Review
328550,Thieves' Gambit: Curse of the Black Cat,"While this wasn't the worst thing I have ever read, I still feel very disappointed. It's a great deal shorter than most of these stories, not very immersive, uninteresting story, bland characters, predictable twists and is often unclear in it's options. I find myself skimming everything in re-reads and didn't care about what happened. I only reccomend it to those who want to play all of these games or want to kill an hour for a cheap price - just don't go in with high expectations. Compared to other games in this genre it is one I have liked the least."

List of big problems, even the most basic of games dont have, but THIS DOES!  -No options menu during the game, so there is no way to change or view your controls. and since al the actions are labeled with the PoS xCrap console controller symbols, you will spend an infuriating time figuring out what is what(i never found out what the ♥♥♥♥ RB is when your using mouse and keyboard, mouse right it aint for sure xD) so yeah, when you get stuck into the training already because of this, it is promising as ♥♥♥♥!  -The UI where you have to walk with the knight on what action you want to take, is clunky as hell.  -There is no actual exit choice, not atleast a clear one, you can keep hitting Escape and search for various methods of leaving the game, but there isnt, apart from crashing it by force...  all in all, the cute graphics, simple game play and mediocre music, do not fix the brain cancer you get from dealing with this games UI.  final verdict; Nothing outstanding. 5/10  but an ok time waster..."
328670,Deer Hunt Legends,"Extremely simple but fun. You have a time limit to shoot things and are penalized for things you shouldn't have shot.   Pros:  - the mechanics are fun, the murdering is satisfying - everything seems to work - graphics are decent - has multiplayer!  Cons: - overly simple - UI imperfections, sloppiness - no online leaderboards yet, I think that would be an essential thing to add"
328680,Crab Cakes Rescue,Crab cakes rescue is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. it is something you can play as a facebook game (cant make it more then it really is)
328710,One Last Day, Early Access Review
328730,Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey,Scary addictive scrabble simulator with upgrade system.
328740,Bit Odyssey, Early Access Review
328760,SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition,"A meal that looks cute and promises nostalgic taste mixed in with humor and turn-based action gameplay. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver, as it's spices will grow dull, the taste you once thought grand now a chore, where you will only fail because you zone out from boredom."
328780,Vampires: Guide Them to Safety!,"While this is a puzzle game, logic will only get you so far in it. Finding a solution to a puzzle is but a small part of gameplay: you then have to implement it. It's real-time, and most of the challenge comes from having your attention divided and having to time your clicks just right, which is never something I want to see in a puzzle game. Results can be unpredictable, which means there's a fair bit of trial and error involved. It gets even worse when the game starts introducing randomization in the pathfinding, ensuring that you  can't  work out a solution ahead of time."
328830,Rugby Union Team Manager 2015,Great game
328880,Space Legends: At the Edge of the Universe,"Space Legends is a decent hidden object/point &amp; click game. You are in control of Elizabeth, who is trying to save the one she loves. You move around to several locations in a big effort to get back home.  The story is lacking in depth and background but…really isn’t that bad. I was still driven by the story to continue on and find out what happens.   The puzzles are good and varying in difficulty. Although the lack of direction and understanding some puzzles caused a little frustration.  The hidden object scenes were great and I always looked forward to them. The hidden object(s) may require several steps before you can collect them (obstructed, not complete, out of reach, etc). However, there weren’t enough of them! For the handful of scenes they had, they were used more than once in each location.   Environments were nicely detailed and the music seemed to match each environment. The only time I noticed the music is when it abruptly stopped and started over again.   This game was definitely translated over to English as the grammar and spelling is incorrect in multiple places. Although, I could tell when they were trying to go for in those situations.  One last point, the ending. It’s abrupt and I was taken by surprise. I would have been fine with a cinematic of how things turned out, etc. But it’s a 3 second ending and then the credits roll.    Pros  +Great hidden object scenes +Detailed environments +Puzzles were good and moderately challenging   Cons  +Not enough hidden object scenes +Bad English translation +Story lacking a bit +Hint button can accidentally be pressed +A few backtracking points +Abrupt ending  I can ONLY recommend this if it’s on a .99 sale or you get it in a bundle. The $9.99 price is way too high for the content you get. Otherwise, it’s a decent hidden object game that will keep you engaged for a handful of hours and test you on some of its puzzles.    5/10  Average"
328890,Fritz for Fun 13,"After installing it &amp; trying to start the game, it asks me to enter the code above - and no matter what characters I put in, it just says they are wrong charcters. I try again and again but to no avail. Still can't figure out what is is up to - just a waste of money and time."
328900,B-17 Flying Fortress: The Mighty 8th,"I purchased this game it is a poor game,bad graphics ,i dont recommend it."
328920,F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0,controlls are confusing. not much tutorial.
328930,Fleet Defender: The F-14 Tomcat Simulation,"One of the best flight sims of the 90's. I have fond memories of playing this as a teenager. Bro was also into the complex operations of the Radar Intercept Officer's back seat operations. Although I disabled these and flew it in more an arcade mode.  Fond memories of hunting down Russian Badger bombers launching cruise missiles at the carrier. Losing it means you only have the ocean to land in. Running out of fuel and trying to glide back to the carrier for a landing. Having to intercept an Unidentified Flying Object and having to try to shoot it down. Doing TARPS missions and having to fly directly over hostile bases. Skipping through the aircraft in the game and watching the dragon fly around (or UFO) =P.  The game featured a branching campaign like Wing Commander, lose the initiative and you'll end up on missions protecting your carrier from enemy assaults. Too many failures and your task group will have to make a strategic withdrawl. The squadron selection was a nice touch as you get to see the insignia on your plane. The game is perfectly flyable with a keyboard, not something you can do these days. This used an updated version of the 1942 Pacific Air War engine, which wasn't surpassed in graphics until around 2000. I spent hours staring at the models.  Great game."
328940,The Deer God,The biggest challenge of this game is not hitting a bug long enough to complete your goals.
328990,Koya Rift,"Slow starter, pixilated, and gets very boring very quickly. Simple rules; get farther, get more points with no additional add ons or additional rewards available. Very poor."
32900,Restaurant Empire II,Pretty fun. Could be better but it's good comapred to others out there.
329000,Data Hacker: Corruption,so boring

329050,Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition,Amazing remaster of an all time favorite!
329110,Gems of War,"Further updated Review for Oct 2016  Long and short: play, enjoy and then move on. The game needs more tweaks to get back to a recommend.   I tell you, this is a game with a very active dev team, which is fantastic. Unfortunately, they continue to implement mechanics in this game that actively punish anyone but the most hardcore of players, or those willing to shell out big, big bucks to hope for the random lottery wins.   Essentially, this is a very very different game from when it first launched. Much more to do for the new player, which is fantastic. The solo play is rewarding, and you will definitely enjoy progressing. Right up to the multiplayer, which has gone from bad to worse. And much, much worse.   Previously, you could assemble teams that mitigated the rng factor substantially, allowing you to defeat most decks with careful construction. The crafting they implemented was a good step as well in the beginning, granting you the ability to heighten select cards to stronger levels. Except all of their crafting is gated. The highest tier is only available to those that either farm the living hell out of this game (somehow), cheat, or pay. There is no means by which lower crafting can improve higher level materials, and the cost of full upgrades is prohibitive. Couple that with the RNG factor gating the most powerful cards that not everyone can get... and, well, it sucks a lot of the fun out of the game.   Each week, once you start the pvp to earn your weekly rewards, the decks you come up against will leave you flattened. What was once a give and take of RNG has become an instant-lose if you miss a bad drop. Frustrating!  They have also ignored any mid game play - the arena used to be an entertaining part of the solo side of things - now, it sits ignored, mostly due to horrible rewards from a very punishing system. Maps were terrible to begin with, and just got worse over time.   Honestly, the only reason i've sunk so much time into this game is I have a few friends in a great clan who still play, and I enjoy chatting in the background while I lose game after game in frustrating pvp battles.   Ah well. So be it."
329130,Reassembly,"Now lets not get confused here. THIS IS A GOOD GAME. It is fun, its scope is huge, and its use of simple game machanics to create a vast, exciting, interesting game rivals that of minecraft. The reason I can't recomend this is just . . . it's TOO addicting. Some might think of that as a great thing and I'm sure the maker is thrilled, though for those who already spend too much time with games and aren't looking to lose hours of time infront of your screen may want to stay away.  tldr; good game, time eater"
329190,Volo Airsport, Early Access Review
329200,Astray,"This game reminds me of mediocre Amnesia custom stories. Puzzles are rediculously easy, pointless rooms aplenty, useless enemies, lack of level design details, a lot of uneventful running around... Bla bla bla... This was a small project.  I do wonder actually, if the dev guys, of which there are seemingly 2, who might be related, judging by their names, have had a go at an Amnesia custom story, had good rating and feedback and well, decided to have a shot at a full game, make moneys.  I wouldn't go as far as recommending it to a good friend, because I am not confident enough they'd enjoy the game and I never, to my friends, recommend or gift games unless I am 100% sure they will love it, but having said that, if you like easy puzzles and half decent locations, a little bit of atmosphere, excellent written English in the notes, on sale for a couple of dollars or whatever, why not get a copy? I can think of many reasons why... but like I said, it's a good laugh for the money if you are into this kind of games."
329240,The Weaponographist,"The game is quite simple. It got a funny story and one of the simplest game mechanic ever. It was easily one of my time waster on my laptop, in the past. You want a game easy to delve into with quirky characters? Choose this one, you won't be disappointed :)"
329280,Avalon Lords: Dawn Rises, Early Access Review
329310,Tile Miner, Early Access Review
329320,QbQbQb,I played this game when I had my wisdom teeth removed. I had a blast! Even sober this game is silly and charming. The karaoke in the main menu was a wonderful touch.
329380,Stealth Inc 2,"  Very dynamic, interesting, with challenges I like a lot"
329430,State of Decay: Year-One,"Even after only playing for 6 minutes, I can confirm that this game is a sack of ♥♥♥♥. It looks and feels like your playing battlefield 4 on windows 98 on the original apple computer. It also runs at 0.00000000001 fps if you try to jump while crouching."
329440,Sonic Lost World,"A very good game. While it may be completely different in tone, it's still fun to traverse the world's and spindash through enemies"
329460,JumpJet Rex,"Rex is a fun little game. Easy to play if you aren't worried about high score and has some interesting challenges if you want full stars on all levels. If you like super meat boy or similar games, this one will keep you entertained for a good few hours. Recommended to play with a controller though."
329480,Snow Light,This is a different type of game that takes a little getting used to. This is more like playing a graphic novel with sub-titles that you have to read. This has decisions that you have to make that could affect the game play. Once I got used to the style of the game it isn 't that bad. The game is not for everyone. The game can use more attention. Yes I do recomend this game because it is not a common game where everything is fast moving like a RPG or FPS.
329490,Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds,Giving a negative review for that loli black screen of death that is only occuring on 'FEW' people... with the only solution given is update windows and restart pc  Edit: *It works now thanks for the mods and devs..  Solution: Nothing i did nothing except for running it everyday.. and now it workds
329610,R.B.I. Baseball 15,I've never gotten through a complete game because it's just no fun to play. Some of the old baseball games for the Commodore were better than this klunker.
329620,Across the Rhine," An interesting looking game with neat music and features, but I don't know what the f*ck I'm even doing... clicking random buttons. If you've never played this before, good luck getting the concept down.  1/10"
329630,Command HQ,"Axis and Allies... When the game developers first set out to make this games, they wanted to make an axis and allies type game with RTS componets. The game is really well done and I still play it often to this day although at this point the graphics are dated (Made in 1990) but once you get used to it, it's a lot of fun."
329640,Eradicator, This gameplay is just like HeXen (N64) but way sh*ttier.  F*ck this game!  1/10
329650,NAM,"overall, great game. the graphics were amazing for their time. 10/10 would buy"
329670,Silent Service 2,"LOOOK! It's an old Game, but a beeutiey! Bought DEARLY, in an era of i.b.m,, ( I.B.M. WITHOUT Steroids). Consoles were withering, after much Success, in the Ei8ghties, and a bugeoning Legacy of Mouse, Joystick, Graphic SURFACE experience, and Pixels, was there for those with the Money. So S.S.II. options are somewhat to be considered. At least Steam offers options, that may only allow ''best fit ' , particularilly for those that complain about the Price. NO!!!! I'sa no lover of the BUY - as - you - RENT, in lieu of genuine ownership of a game, that hopefully has 'BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY' for decent generational duration, that exists only in 'THUNDERSTORM ' clouds. ENJOY this reasonably Crafted, best Re-Incarnated Rendition of .........  WE LUCKY we Get!"
329680,Task Force 1942: Surface Naval Action in the South Pacific,"terrible...............installed the game since steam promised there was a manual............there was none,and no hints on how to acess one............total waste of money...steam should be ashamed of themselves"

329770,4089: Ghost Within,"Confusing mess of a game! If the developers had put some work into the game it had potential, but in the end it is a mess of bad explanations and clunky gameplay!"
329790,Krosmaster Arena,"GUIDE TO GETTING STARTED (with review below)  Launch Krosmaster Arena from your steam Library and you should see a pop-up window. Now before you click the big play button there are some things you should know that you will want to do first to get it set-up properly!  First off Krosmaster Arena is actually made in France with an English translation so occasionally some of the menu's can be misinterpretated. THAT BEING SAID:   !!!!! -- BEFORE YOU CLICK PLAY -- !!!!! (from the pop-up's bottom right corner) You will want to click the icon that looks like 2 little gears in the top right corner of the pop-up window (that appears after you launch Krosmaster Arena from Steam) and that should bring up an OPTIONS window that should ask (ONLY the FIRST time) if you've previously created an Ankama account for Krosmaster Arena. If you do NOT already have an Ankama account then please select use my steam account. IT SHOULD THEN SAY CONNECTION SUCCESFUL!!! Now try clicking play for the first time. Chances are that upon the first time attemping to play you will get an error and the game won't launch succesfully, if that happens just close Krosmaster and re-launch it a second time from Steam.   v v v THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!!! v v v ----------------------------------------------------------------- NOW EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH Krosmaster Arena from steam you need to click the icon of the 2 gears in the top right corner of the pop-up window and it should bring up a window with the header 'OPTIONS' at the top; make sure you are in the tab labeled 'my account' with the single button labeled 'Sign-in with Ankama Account' click that and it should come up with the message 'Connection Successful'. Now you can close the Options window and click play and Krosmaster Arena should run successfully. ----------------------------------------------------------------- ^ ^ ^ IMPORTANT ^ ^ ^   Upon playing Krosmaster Arena for the first time you will be prompted with a tutorial that will teach you how to play. After you finish the tutorial's 5 stages you will want the hit your escape key on your keyboard to open your in game options menu and you will want to click on 'SAVE MY ACCOUNT' this will make it so that your Steam account is a fully fledged Ankama account so that you can use your same account on mobile devices and so that if you already have the table top version or figure expanions then you can have those Krosmasters to play using key codes. Now when you are filling out this window with your e-mail, password, and username, The category titled 'username' is actually your 'nickname' it's a translation error. Later on if you've been playing for a couple hours you'll probably get a pop-up in between one of the game menu's that asks you to re-verify your account by asking you FILL IN YOUR &gt;&gt;USERNAME AND PASSWORD&lt;&lt;, but again it's a translation error because what it really wants is your &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;E-MAIL AND PASSWORD&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;... Be sure also verify your account by taking care of the verification e-mail that you'll be sent.   =============================================   v v v PROBLEMS CHALLENGING A FRIEND!!!??? v v v In game when you are not in a battle you SHOULD have a little golden colored bell in the bottom right corner of your screen that you use to accept challenges from friends... How ever if it's not there it's because your screen resolution might not work properly at first and so it's cutting off a sliver of the bottom portion of the game. To fix this all you have to do is go into your options by hitting your escape key and going into the video tab and uncheck full screen and change your screen resolution to be lower. If you want to play the game in fullscreen and still have the bottom portion of the game visible then all you need to do is (after doing the previous of unchecking fullscreen) exit the game, then re-launch it from steam (Don't forget to click the icon of the 2 gears and connect your account before clicking play) and then enter the in game options by hitting your escape key and then re-enable full screen. From now on your game should no longer have this issue of cutting off the bottom of the screen. =)  You can challenge a friend by entering the arena, and going to the challenge tab at the bottom there should be a button labeled 'Challenge a Friend' and then just type in there username. =D   =============================================   TUTORIAL + TIPS UNSPECIFIED:  A few nice tips not specified in the tutorial is that you can left click and hold on the green squares to draw a line for your characters movement and that you can right click to cancel things. Also if you left click and hold on the map you can move the camera while right clicking and holding on the map will allow you to rotate the camera. And one last tip is that in the upper right corner durring a battle there is a button that looks like a brown book with the letter 'K' on it that when clicked will open a timeline so you can see what you and your opponent's dice rolls are.  When you roll a crit it gives +1 to damage given, a shield gives -1 to damage recieved, a flee (shoe) gives +1 for you to flee/escape, a lock (magnet) gives -1 to the opponent trying to flee/escape to avoid being locked, and a Dofus (dragon egg) automatically gives you the roll wanted per given situation. AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH TURN you get the ability to give some of your characters a second/extra dice for certain rolls; Ex.: Like a giving a character the crit die so they can roll 2 dice to attempt to get +1 damage per roll... The dice are six sided with 1 face of each of the 4 main icons, crit, shield, flee, lock, but the dice also have a face with the Dofus icon which can count as any 1 of the 4 main icons, along with the sixth face being a crit + flee icon where you choose either crit or flee.  When one of your Krosmasters dies you lose (and your opponent) gains Gallons of Glory equal to the dead Krosmaster's level, but it should also be noted there is 1 Wild Gallon of Glory in reserve that gets taken before you or your opponents Gallons of Glory get taken. The 1 Wild Gallon of Glory can not be removed from the 'Intensity Rises' effect caused by rolling 2 of the same icons at the beggining of each players turn SO LONG as it is still in the reserve. However if someone purchases a Gallon Glory by using one of the shops or when the FIRST Krosmaster dies then the first Gallon of Glory purchased/taken will be the 1 Wild Gallon of Glory (removing it from the reserve) with the rest then coming from the players themselves.   =============================================   REVIEW:   If you want a strategy game that is flexible, diverse, and fluid but is easier and quicker to play than 40,000K or Warmachine, but still able to be competative, then this is the game for you! =D Grid based game play, teams assembled based on point value, Initiative turn order and character activation order, melee attacks, ranged attacks, and summon abilties, along with characters having 1 use abilties per turn, per target, or per game. Stats of movement points, action points, and health points. Per game shops to purchase items for use per game from currency collected from that game only. The ability to purchase the table top version and unlock characters in game using key codes so you don't have to buy the DLC Character packs if you've already got the table top version / expansions. It's a good game, If what I just listed sounds like it might be worth giving a try then I would definately recomend it. =)   I like this game and have played the table top version many times, but there are a few things about the digital version I wish they would fix. The first time set-up is rather abnoxious and the digital version is still running with the rule setup based on the table top 1.0 version rules, so being used to playing the 2.0 version rules can be a bit off-setting to go back and forth. =P"
329830,The Moon Sliver,"Very calm, relaxing sorta game. In my opinion it's more like reading a book but now you can interact with the world while in the story."
329860,Catlateral Damage,"It's a fodder game for let's players, but its easily also one of the best. It's also pretty easy, which is a bonus. Would recommend absolutely if you have VR, but even without it's a good game."
329970,KeeperRL, Early Access Review
329980,ASA: A Space Adventure - Remastered Edition,on OSX it is completely broken and unplayable - no combination of screen/desktop resolution makes the game content fit the screen or work with the mouse - it is totally unplayable and broken. if your going to release a game for a particular o/s (in this case OSX) it would be best to test it first. so do i recommend it ? absolutely not.
3300,Bejeweled 2 Deluxe,This game was preinstalled on Windows Vista as a trial for 3 HP coins. I was sad that I ran out of coins as I just enjoyed this game so much. Now I got it! Now I can play all the time! Recommanded? Well yeah!
330000,Kingdoms CCG,"EDIT for 2016. This game is out of development. It is merely being maintained at this point. The player base is tiny and shrinking and new players will never be given the means to catch up. Don't bother.   Few hours here, but probably a couple thousand via a browser.   Its NOT P2P or P2W. Energy is almost completely irrelevant, as it regenerates quickly and there are plenty of things to do that don't cost energy.  You can get 7 free packs by doing the 'advanced tutorials' - through a lightbulb on the bottom left of the campaign screen. With just these packs, you can easily compete in beginner arena (which is vs AI - there are also two arenas where it is live PvP matchups)  New Devs are GANZ (makers of Webkinz) who seem dedicated to the ongoing improvement of this product.   I have several alt accounts that have spend NO MONEY at all in this game and were able to complete the campaign and compete at Epic guild level. You get PLENTY of free premium currency through login bonuses, achievements and arena quests. You do not need to pay for the premium currency. Still, a small purchase will speed your advancement and is a nice thank you to the developers if you like their game."
330020,Children of Morta,"Still playing the Alpha, as I am a Kickstarter backer, but this game is surprisingly solid so far. A mix of a roguelike with RPG elements in that the areas are different every time, each character has a skill tree, there are upgradeable trinkets, and every character plays extremely differently. Pixel graphics are done very well to make a pretty game, an the animations are top notch. Slow drip of lore and storytelling in an almost Dark Souls way. Speaking of Dark Souls, you are going to die, a lot. But thats okay, you keep all of your gold and stuff to make and upgrade trinkets, and you keep your levels gained for that character. Gameplay is a 2D mashup between Dark Souls and Diablo, where there are tons of groups of enemies (with elites mixed in), and you have to use your skills and attacks to both dodge and cut them down.  Overall, I can't wait for more updates and for the game to hit release."
330100,BossConstructor,"This reminds me of reassembly in a good way. But it starts up with a survey. I would probably have liked the game and recommended it, but I can't get past the fact that the game starts up with a survey. This is shameful. It's not as bad as an npc trying to sell you DLC, or day one DLC, but it still gets under my skin just enough that I can't enjoy the actual game. And the actual game is nice. I wanted more games where you can customize your ship piece by piece and the game does that well. But that survey at startup just bothers me."
330130,MAGIX Fastcut,Aweful piece of software cannot recommend. Unless you do not mind going back in there and editing the cuts manually the final product is not something that I can recommend.  Take your money and spend it somewhere else. Even at discounted price I cannot recommend it.
330160,Substance Designer 5,The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-runtime-I 1-O.dll
330180,Pix the Cat,"It's a fun little casual game. You're bored and have nothing to do right now? Run this game and you will have fun for the next 15 minutes.  It has cute graphics and good music. You're a cat collecting eggs to hatch ducklings and the more you get your speed grows and it gets harder and harder. Trying to best yourself is the most fun. 'I just hit 800 000! I bet I can hit 1 000 000 as well! Let's try it out' and then you sit there, trying to beat your own highscore. You can let friends play this game as well, let them try to be your highscore, after all you can enter a name for the leaderboard! The game also comes with two extra features that are fun to play with, strategical thinking is required sometimes.  I've read somewhere that someone compared it with the classic games snake and pac-man, and I think that's a good comparison."
330270,Warlocks vs Shadows,"Gameplay is extremely shallow, doesn't encourage different playstyles or strategies. Characters and enemies are poorly balanced, certain characters feel vastly superior to others. Not a game worth paying for."
330350,Robotex,"I do not recommend this game, it was poorly made and full of glitches."
330370,Reload,"Great reflex and target shooting game! Shoot houses, skeet shooting, rifles, hand guns, static and moving targets.   CONS: The Sniping. Really bad function and control. Takes the fun out of it."
330390,GRANDIA II HD Remaster,"One of my favourite JRPG combat systems and some good characters. Gets quite 'power of the heart!' in places, but deffo worth a run through. Just mind the voice acting."
330420,The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy,"The voice acting is hot garbage, the humor is straight from a particularly unfunny style of adventure gaming where rapid-fire snark replaces any modicum of wit, and the puzzles are dreadfully dull. In an age where Wadjet Eye Games continues to release exceptional projects, you can do much, much better than Dog Mendoca and Pizza Boy."
330450,Runes of Brennos, Early Access Review
330460,Celestial Command, Early Access Review
330470,Over The Void,"I really hated the part when I ran out of levels to play. The game is absolutely beautiful. Each level is unique and for $0.49 during the Winter 2016 Sale, I feel like I got a deal. I played right through, no stopping, and it took me about two hours. I still had time to stop and appreciate the environment as well.  The game is just tragically short. Also, each level plays by a different set of game rules. So some action that will 'kill' you in one level doesn't do it in another level. I also would have liked seamless transitions between levels and the game would have felt completely continuous. However, I could see how people would want to get to a stopping point."

330620,It's A Wipe!,Love that ♥♥♥♥!
330660,Luna's Wandering Stars,"Stupid. I used my mac to play the game. At level 2 of the first planet it crashed! I can not do anything! It does not go to the next level when you pass the level. So, if you want to play just the first two level and get pis‌sedoff, go ahead and buy."
330670,DiscStorm,"Towerfall is very similar, and better in all regards. The soundtrack is good."
330680,Solar Struggle,So disappointing. At least I only lost 5.95 I miss you 5.95
330720,Flashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm,"This is, hands down, my favorite game on Steam.  I've enjoyed many hours playing PBeM with friends from all over the place. In fact, I've made new friends by way of this game.  Good stuff."
330760,Running Shadow,Have fun and play it until it costs money to play more. Then just move on to temple run or something.
330770,Radial-G : Racing Revolved,It's fun
330820,2064: Read Only Memories,"Very good game. Not as good as 'Snatcher' on the SEGA mega-CD (a similar game), but still really cool!"
330830,Tales from the Borderlands,"Good story, memorable characters. Bought on sale, well worth the price. Good fun playing as a family with everyone making decisions."
330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,"My wife and I love GoT and wanted this title from TellTale for a while, but I wasn't about to spend the $30 asking price after reading most of the reviews. Got it during the winter sale for like 10 bucks or so... I'm glad didn't pay $30. She liked it, I guess that's all that matters, but I'm glad we finished it so we can get back to playing something better. Good for GoT fans and fans of the TellTale style, but I'd suggest Walking Dead seasons 1 and 2 and Life is Strange."
330880,Redemption, Early Access Review
330990,Demon Hunter: Chronicles from Beyond,"Clear graphics in HO moments, it was not too bad to try and look for items. Graphics were good every where else too and story was ok. There was much going back and fourth to places you all ready were so that was little messy."
3310,Chuzzle Deluxe,"2.50 for a classic, cutesy puzzle game is a deal i'd take any day"
33100,Alien Shooter,Childhood memory.  It works.  It is fluent.  It is a good stress relief game. Just like the Postal series (1 and 2 that is).  Just buy yes?
33110,Alien Shooter: Revisited,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.... It says I played two hours. Yes... 2 hours. 0.5 hours on the first 90% of the game, and 1.5 hours on the last level of the game. It was on Medium and for some reason all the 3000+ aliens decided to make me their girlfriend in the corridors. I don't know if the game glitched and I ended up on a harder difficulty but this game absolutely yanked the floor mat out from under me.   I was playing Alien Shooter 1 &amp; 2 for old time sake and saw this one... so I played it after beating the other two earlier tonight.... I decdied to try this and beat it in an hour. NOooooooOOooooo... this one said 'YOU WANT SOME?!!!' and brought the hurt.   So yeah, I did beat it. Slicing the Pie, Solitary Bounding Overwatch, and having to run around like a little girl screaming 'in the game' allowed me to finish the last level. Now I'm going to go rethink my enjoyment of games.   10/10 would suffer again. :)   I recommend anyone getting all three of these to play the original Alien Shooter first... just so you can see what is different. Enjoy."
331120,Passing Pineview Forest,"I'm usually one to get scared very easily over games, the type of guy who jumps over his own shadow in games but this game was extremely boring and repetitive and had me yawning throughout it, wishing that it would end. I had read the reviews beforehand and everyone seems to be saying it's 'Scary as hell!' and 'Wouldn't play it again' which got me excited and felt that this would have been a really good Free Horror game that I could try out.   First few minutes in, sure... I was kind of scared and going in to the two houses was probably the only bit that had me on the edge of my seat and that was within the first three minutes of playing but after that it was nothing more than just going down a dark forest path for 15 minutes and listening out for footsteps. It felt very bland and I just wasn't feeling the whole atmosphere of it. The music however was amazing, that's what made it scarier... if there was no music then I would have thought it was just a Forest walking simulator. I watched videos to see what would happen if you ran and didn't listen out for sounds and saw that a pair of hands appear on your screen. LMFAO. Are you kidding me? A pair of hands? I was expecting scary ghostly figures to appear behind trees or walk out of the dark gloomy mist in front of the player only to disappear within seconds. I was expecting a creepy figure to be in one of the houses or a monster that may have actually came in to the house and required you to hide.  Just a boring sequence Start walking, hear footsteps, stop, start walking, hear footsteps, stop... keep repeating.   I appreciate and prefer horror games that focus more on atmosphere then cheap jump scares, but this didn't make me feel scared at all. Worth a try though..."
331160,Cars,"This game is amazing! I played this in 2009 and this brings back so many memories, I love this game and i love cars."
331190,Master Spy,I almost want to give it a thumbs down just for including cutscenes where your character manhandles elite assassins but has no combat and features instant death upon sight. The gameplay is tight enough that I can just barely overcome the spite.
331200,Grass Simulator,BEST GAME EVER buy it not joking. nothing about grass just killing cows there is online best game played for hours!
331210,"Bolt Riley, A Reggae Adventure - Chapter 1", Early Access Review
331220,Thief Town,Great casual-couch game to play with friends in parties !
331290,Miko Gakkou: Second Year,"Do you want to play a cheap, tasteless Simon-Says-ish fusion of Rythym Heaven and Bullet Hell where all you do is press two buttons? And how about featuring some barely coherent, completely disconnected series of 'cutscenes' trying to pass itself off as a story which is chock-full of stupid, overused boob jokes that you got sick of five years ago with these anime games? As well as voice acting that makes want to shove a pair of switchblades into your ears? And what about dull, repetitive music tracks in the Rythym Heaven-ish gameplay which fail to stand out in any way whatsoever, even from each other, because they all sound exactly the same?  If you're someone who enjoys that kind of abomination, I strongly question your tastes in 'fun', but by all means go for it. The rest of you, save your money. Don't invest in Miko Gakkou. This crime against video gaming is not even worth the $5.99 it sells for on it's Store Page."
33130,Zombie Shooter,yes please
331340,Tulpa,"Try and die. Again, again, again. Almost impossible to solve some puzzles at first try. Puzzles quite primitive and most of them don't conform to any common sense. In addition, there are some flaws related to mouse control - sometimes some parts are clickable too late, making player think that it's not clickable at all. Apart from that from audiovisual side it's quite nice, that doesn't save the day for the game though."
331390,Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc,"Great Game. HIGH APM required even on the easiest difficulty. There is a 'Strategic Pause' for people that are not good at APM (Like me). Game Plays simliar to plant vs zombies except instead of your Plants, aka Spirits they have a life timer that will despawn when it runs out. This requires you to constantly replace units and strategise on the fly if your not using the Pause button, or if your playing on the hardest difficulty which prevents you from pausing. Game has some serious grindy elements, that IMO is a little to much. You can upgrade/Enchant your Spirits weapons and accesaries so they can do more damage, attack faster, live longer, ETC. Which is HIGHLY needed. so more GRIND.  If you dont Grind your going to be in some serious hurt. Could not pass the 7th Stage on NORMAL! had to grind for about an hour just to pass it on EASY LOL. Yep I suck at these types of games.  I have read some other comments below, and others have posted very good criticism for the game and what I have seen, I agree with lots of what they put out.  Some 'do not recommend' Ex: No, Gives out great criticism regarding the game, and High lights alot of what the game is about.  I would recommend this game for those who like a good APM style game, or those who need to practise their APM LOL.  "
331400,Luna: Shattered Hearts: Episode 1,This game is a adventure-platformer hybrid built around an artistic vision on how the game should look- and it does have a certain look and feel not seen much.   Dont know if the story is good. First 30 minutes there is a lot of talk and glimpses into background lore - all told in a very rambling way but i have hopes things will clear up.   So if you are looking for a tightly polished platformer game then keep looking and skip this. Adventure game fans will not like this one either. First level is a mess and quite hard. Nothing is explained and a dogged determination is required to advance. Only played 30+ minutes and advancement is quite slow yet the UI is not as bad as i feared from the greenlight discussions. 360 controller works great as long as you dont touch the LT/RT buttons which for some reason is windowed/full screen button.   Game does have a certain appeal. nothing is explained and so you have to learn things the hard way.  edit: completed the game. It was good but the before mentioned caveats are still there.Storywise episode I does not give any kind of conclusions. It is a pretty decent game that gets better as you learn the ropes. I will be looking forward to Episode II.  edit2: dev released a guide to the game. It is pretty much essential to take a look at it
331440,bit Dungeon II,"Interesting game. You can use a Control, and have more 'say in it' or just use your mouse to move around and click on the enemies and the game will kind of do the thing for you. Either way, buy for less than 1$ and you'll be happy."
331450,Finding Nemo,"Absolute garbage. Not worth $0.01 of value. Dates technology used in the 1990's. Can't change resolution. No controller support. Has many issues working on multiple monitors. Didn't get a chance to play it for a while, and got no refund. Dont waste even ten cents on this game. My 4 year old was even saying this game sucks."
331460,ROOMS: The Toymaker's Mansion,"Simply put, this game is a must have for every puzzle game enthusiast!!! I found this game to be challenging and rewarding."
331470,Everlasting Summer,Killing time game.... but not that fun IMHO
331500,Executive Assault,love the idea of it fps meets rts its a great combo
331510,Amphora,"A beautiful game with charming audiovisuals which tells us a story about a friendly alien vase from space struggling to help a family of mentally handicapped people survive through everyday struggles and war. Mostly everyday struggles.  It's really hard to decide whether to recommend Amphora or not. As said above, it looks stunning and sounds marvelously. But awkward unpredictable game physics almost ruined it for me. And yes, the plot. It sometimes becomes incredibly hard to make out what exactly is happening and what to do with all this.  What I really liked is the chance to roleplay. If you get too furious about your lads' stupidity, you may go full berserk   and slam those ret@rded basards across the screen, throw knives, grenades, animals, lava and other pieces of environment at them. Unfortunately, they don't die but nevertheless give you a slight emotional relief.     So yeah, Amphora is recomended for aesthetes and creative minds who like to play games in their own creative ways   lol  "
331570,Wimp: Who Stole My Pants?,Glad to see this game was modeled after my handsome self.
331580,ULTRAWORLD EXODUS,"The textbook example of a pretentious indie project, an 'interactive adventure' (I can't call it a game, my mind just won't let me) on par with stellar projects like 'Gone Home' and 'Walking simulator 983: Now with social commentary.'  Cliche'd questions, cliche'd dillemas. The game tries really hard to appear deep, but there is no suspense of disbelief big enough to keep this thing going. 'Hurf durf I'm totally an AI who made a game as soon as I became self aware, now help me solve some existential questions.'  The visuals looked good at first, but everything's so movie-grain saturated, so filled with glare and bloom then my eyes cannot stand looking at it without tearing up.  The OST is an assortment of electronic blurbs and weak attempts to pander to the TRON atmosphere, I suppose. Done quite poorly.  Zero gameplay whatsoever. Go from point A to point B, listen to a boring siloloquy which is supposed to stir some sort of questions in the mind of the player, proceed onwards.  The problem is - for people who have no interest in this kind of things, the game will seem boring due to lack of interactivity. For people who know even a tiniest bit about AIs from mass media the game will seem boring, since it's exploiting the same tropes that premate all the blockbusters about robots these days. The only audience who can probably appreciate it are hipsters, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screw those people.  To sum it up, If I wanted to be educated about AIs and their problems, I'd much rather read Azimov than play this. "
331600,ONE PIECE PIRATE WARRIORS 3,It's........ SSSSSSUUUUUUPPPPPEEEEERRRRR!
331610,Movie Studio Boss: The Sequel,Dont buy this waste of money
331650,Carmageddon TDR 2000,"I played this game (retail version) at least 10 years ago. Might be 12.  I had tons of fun playing it. Its one of those games that you play a lot but in short bursts.   You feel like you have 'enough' and have sated your thirst for gaming.  Later you come back for more...  I bought this for nostalgic reasons.  At some point of the game, I could not progress further because of crashes.  So in technical terms, I cannot recommend this game.  The soundtrack is not there, I think. But I never played it with soundtrack - therefore I am going to remain neutral here.  - I have no idea how it will perform on your computer but keep in mind the complaints in the other reviews, I can confirm them."
331720,Survivor Squad: Gauntlets,I really enjoyed this game! I believe you should give it a try ;)
331750,WALL E,"So $18 because my son loves Wall-E.  First level is a tutorial, son enjoyed it because there is a short movie afterwards with 30+ Wall-E bots. Second level is a 1:30 timed run down to the truck to take shelter from the incoming storm.  Third level I expected a free form level I would just be able to let him play around in. Instead there is an extremely small level around the truck and the only thing to do is break 30 boxes. Son would have been happy to have control of the tv in the truck (press E and play a small clip or something) and be able to open and close the truck's cargo door. Alas.  Graphics are worse than PlayStation 2 Shrek the Third from ~2007 and the camera controls are a little too hard for little kids."
331760,Supreme League of Patriots Issue 1: A Patriot Is Born,"The writing, voice acting, music, visiuals are all quite good but at the same time they are so boring and bland I just don't get it. For me this dwells in the same league as visual novels. FastClicker.exe through the game using guide to get 100% achievements and don't even bother to understad what's is going on. Nah for all 3 parts."
331790,Data Hacker: Reboot,"This game doesn't work correctly on Windows 10, lacking the Gothic VL font, which will fail to install if your firewall is managed correctly.   As a result, I cannot recommend the purchase of this game - technical faults prevent correct operation."
33180,Zombie Shooter 2,"More zombies, more guns, more skill points and more top-down, isometric action. The 'Shooter' series, as I've said elsewhere, does one thing and one thing well: pitched battles against more on-screen enemies then almost any game out there."
331880,Truck Mechanic Simulator 2015,"Missing the air compresser, air lines, air tanks, only three models of trucks, no hint for when you get stuck, unrealistic test track, missing the windsheild washer tank, no cap to remove and pour oil in when doing and oil change, no bucket under the oil filters, no oil running out when their filters are removed, bad grammar and a bunch of more things."
331920,Airline Tycoon Deluxe,This was a game from my youth. It turns out i have had just as much fun playing it now that i did back then. Excelet buy.
331970,Disney's Treasure Planet: Battle of Procyon,"One of my most favorite PC games of all time. I used to play this all the time when I was younger on my old Windows XP machine on CD-ROM. It never gets old. If you like shoot 'em up games - and therapeutic ones at that - definitely check this one out. I'm a fan of sci-fi settings as well as naval battles and, while this game is relatively simple, it brings both of those preferences together."
331980,Last Inua,"It's pretty, but that's where the good things end, pretty much :/ The gameplay itself feels very... half-baked. And the whole story being told in Comic Sans really doesn't help."
3320,Insaniquarium! Deluxe,I just love this game and I'm so glad it's on Steam. It's my childhood right here! Tons of fun and truly insane!
332070,School of Dragons: How to Train Your Dragon,very fun and I love to play it chek it out:D
332200,Axiom Verge,"Its a hard game, but that doesnt magically make it good. It has a solid foundation but youll be left feeling directionless and dying a LOT of cheap deaths. unavoidable damage is everywhere.   I grew up with an snes and though the visuals are reminicent of the era, the game play isnt. this is the only 'overwhelmingly positive' game on steam that i cant recommend, unless you really like walking in circles."
332250,The Next Penelope,"It got stuck on the load screen, so I erased and downloaded it again. Still didn't work. tried several solutions, like changing permissions and now it doesn't load. Pitty, it looked promising"
332260,Cars Mater-National,"what if your car came to life and it could drive a car (itself) in a race with you still inside? and you could never get out, never escape the car, the car has replaced you and will never need your help again. 0/10"
33230,Assassin's Creed II,"It's a-me, Mario!  10/10"
332310,LEGO® Worlds, Early Access Review
332330,PixelJunk™ Shooter Ultimate,"More frustration than fun, compared to the original. Wiping out the green self replicating mass is not fun (epic click-fest), digestive acid slow death is not fun (water, water, where is the water? two screens away, oh), death for touching the walls (cave flyers from the eighties) not fun - basically it continues in terms of difficulty where the original left off which is way too much for me."
332360,Spriter Pro,"I'm using Spriter Pro to animate characters for a school project. It doesn't take long to learn, and you can create some really nice animations with it. Automatically exports frames into .png images, a single spritesheet, or even an animated .gif! Even has a mode to turn high-res images into pixel art. And it does make some decent pixel art out of them, they don't turn all blurry and such. Looks nice and crisp."
332390,Undefeated,"Bought the Deluxe pack, which came with very useful items! Some 'save' files which were great for me to start out with since I was mostly interested in the storyline, less the gameplay (which is the same across all RPG maker style games).   Just one note/suggestion on the guide/walkthrough - it would have been great if the maps included in the guide were more holistic. I know this defeats the purpose of exploring, but if I wanted to explore, I wouldn't use a walkthrough. It'd be great if the guide had circle which locations to search and to also indicate the secret rooms on the maps throughout the guide, instead of at the end.  Even if we left the secret rooms to the end, which was fine anyway, it'd be great if there were notes as to which map the room was on, just as a way to support the player. Some screenshots for the secret rooms did not correspond to the map location, so it was fortunate that I did make the effort to explore all over anyway.  BUT, all in all. I enjoyed the story. The cutscene before the ending fight was not what I expected, AND I'M SAD! If there's an Undefeated 2, I hope you-know-who makes a dramatic come-back."
332400,Girlfriend Rescue,"All the girls in this game are my new waifu's. I'm in a harem, don't judge me nerds."
332410,Moonchild,"Pros: Nice maps Different 'styles' to play the game in.  Con: Writing is ♥♥♥♥ poor, grammar and spelling errors on top of just horrible story/lines. Game doesn't play well with steam can't shift tab to do anything else, often crashes when you alt tab.  No screen settings to change how big the game is, fullscreen or super tiny."
332490,Battle Fleet 2,"COMPLETLY LAME THE CREATORS OF THIS GAME SHOULD NEED TO BE BEATEN IN THE STREET.WOULD IT KILL U TO ADD DETAIL&amp;DEPTH TO YOUR GAME?MORE SHIPS,WEAPONS,AIR POWER PLAYED A HUGE FACTOR IN WW2 CARRIERS NEED A REALISTIC INVENTORY OF PLANES.&amp;WHY CANT U CUSTOMIZE YOUR TERRITORYS ALL THESE THINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ITS 2015 GAMES ARE MORE REALISTIC NOW STEP IT UP"
332500,GRAV, Early Access Review
332530,Shutshimi,"I was really hoping that this game was more like Parodius, with actual levels. It's just a wave based game, and the waves are very short, in fact, too short. This is fun for a one time play, but it's not a game that I will come back to ever again."
332540,We Slay Monsters, Early Access Review
332570,Amazing Frog?, Early Access Review
332580,Mimpi,"  I received Mimpi as a gift for the holidays, and while it has its charms, I feel that these charms are offset by a few very significant flaws.   Firstly, the charms. The game is super cute (like, have you SEEN that dog?!) and the music and general theme is totally funky and surreal. It's really neat, and definitely adds to the experience. Mimpi looks really great walking, jumping, and peeing around; just seeing it brought a smile to my face. Mimpi also has a hint system, which is great for someone like me, since I'm rather terrible at puzzle games.   Now, the flaws. Mimpi's control is... very loose. Extremely loose, in fact. I died many times making what I thought were sure-fire easy jumps because of this. It's funny at first, but it gets frustrating fast, especially after you manage to get through a difficult sequence only to die because of a minor gameplay hiccup. Mimpi's UI is also very unhelpful. Everything is unlabeled, so you have to really do some trial-and-error to figure out what buttons do what. This is a minor flaw, but one that I really feel like should have been fixed before the game came out (I really can't remember the last time I played a game that didn't have any buttons at all labeled). The puzzles themselves can also be rather repetitive and uninspiring; I saw many of the same types of puzzles being reused, as if they were just filler or something like that. It's a shame, since the puzzles are rather charming at first, but they get old rather quickly once you realize it's mostly all you're going to see.   Overall, I think that if you're willing to look past Mimpi's very loose controls and repetitive puzzles, then you might enjoy playing it. However, I'm not too sure if the charms of the game - which aren't really at all gameplay-related - make it worth it. In my experience, I tried liking the game a lot, and I really enjoyed the dog and the art, but, ultimately, I ended up disliking the game due to its gameplay. It's just not very fun. :/  STILL THAT DOG IS SO CUTE OMGGGGG &lt;3  Pros: - Cute artstyle - Funky music and sound effects - Hint system   Cons: - Very loose controls - Unhelpful UI - 'Filler' puzzles"
332620,PONCHO,"An underrated little game since it was developed by two people. There's not much too it length wise, but the inbetween is what makes it, as the levels are beautiful and the music is awesome. If there was a more intricate rating system I'd have to give this game about a 7/10, but try the game yourself."
332630,The Guilt and the Shadow,So after purchase I quickly learned you're required five minutes of game play before writing a review.  I saw the game had a 10/10 Positive review. Overwhelming urge to purchase and keep it going. . . .  11/10 - Would purchase again to give 12/10. . . .
332710,1Quest,It's a nice rougelike.
332730,Barbarian Brawl,SERVERS ARE DOWN!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!  its an online only game with no server to connect thru.    Only need say 1 thing to show how great this game is: __ 100% achivements in under 3 hours. -- Rest of the game time (8.1h) was just to score the All time high Top rank 2015-03-08

333100,Demesne, Early Access Review
333130,Do Not Fall," ‘Run For Your Drink, Do Not Fall’ is a fun little game that is, sadly, not unlike many others."
33320,Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,"An interesting blend of new and old.  GFX: Beautiful, and remarkably well performing; 130-180fps average, never saw it dip below 120.  SFX: Good music and sound effects. STRY: Set between The Sands of Time and The Warrior Within a fair story involving his brother, but unless I missed something major there appears to be no tie-in to the other games. Would've been nice to leave this one off knowing how the Dahaka came about since it was never explained in the WW. It felt more like TSoT storytelling vs either of the others, and I actually enjoyed the D'jinn character and her banter. GMPLY - Depressingly short... The good: They took all the best parts of TSoT and TWW and combined them here. The water based puzzles were an amazing addition. The obnoxious balancing act on beams was removed, hazah! The bad: Combat was downgraded from needing a of skill to a button mashy and far less of a challengeing affair than any of the other games. The classic traps: spike-pillars, darts, floor-spikes, etc; were no challenge at all, unlike the old games. A little bit of assistance on jump direction is one thing, this game takes it to the extreme, at least in the first half of the game; over-assisted-hand-holding-platformer-mode engaged.  4.5/5  tl;dr: Worth a playthrough, just slog through the first half (basically a tutorial) to get to the fun water puzzles."
333210,Kaiju-A-GoGo,"I backed the KickStarter and IndieGoGo campaigns for this game and I think Kerberos Productions have gone far with such a small but very fun game. This may not be a AAA freaking game with GTA 5 graphics but the visuals and gameplay are great with each city you visit to stomp the **** outta it. I've played every Kaiju including the recently added Grey Goop Kaiju, and winning the game with each is different and veryyyyyy slowwwwww, but enjoyable &amp; worth playing. I look forward to more Kaiju's being added to this game if they DO, but I only wish we could create and customize our own Kaiju to smash &amp; bash the available cities. Where is Denver CO? I always wanted to have a Giant Kaiju rampage through downtown. Grrrrrrr!"
333220,Cherry Tree High I! My! Girls!,"Removes all of the gameplay elements of the first game in favor of pure text scroll.  Most of the characters from the first game are sidelined in favor of a new, less interesting one, with only a few bonus chapters that focus on them.  It's at least an hour or two shorter than the first and lacks any replayability."
333260,Marvin's Mittens,This game completely caught me by surprise. Pretty fun and relaxing to play.
333290,Mos Speedrun 2,"This is really one of my favorite platformers of all time. The word 'speedrun' is not a gimmick, this is an actual speed running game, and it's got great mechanics, really challenging levels and an awesome soundtrack. If you like video games you should play it. I personally got pretty addicted and ended up playing for many days straight. That's more entertainment than most AAA-games will get you in this day and age, and AAA-games don't have funky background music."
333300,ADOM (Ancient Domains Of Mystery),"Gamebreaking bug. When I select my character by clicking him, the menu won't pop up, and I will be stuck. Have to hard reset the game to restart the game. I've had to hard reset like over a dozen times, and since it is a 'roguelike' game there is no save of my character, and a self save takes me back to the main screen (annoying).  Fun game though w/ tons of characters and classes to play. Pretty basic like other games like Hammerwatch imo, w/o multiplayer which is a shame. Typical hack in slash that is strongly keyboard based though. Game is probably slightly overpriced, and worth probably in the 9.99 for the basic overall quality of the game (there really is no soundtrack for example).  What is cool, is you get to play a combo of tons of races and classes (that should be more previlent in more fantasy genre games like this one), but are not. For instance I love playing a Troll Barbarian.  This game I guess is a bit old there are some indie strat guides out there to help you select your character and to explain stuff (like selling stuff requires you to go into the merchant shop and drop the item on the shop floor, lol weird), and in that regard, the game seems overall unpolished compared to the price point which it is at imo.  ----  After playing more hours and seeing the dev reply to the game, let me expand my review some more.  This is the typical game that falls into 'challenging' and tries to prey on perhaps the nostalgic feelings of those who maybe played this game in the past.  Granted I like challenging games, but realistically you will get 3-7 hours of frustrating fun.  I found it extremely difficult to get past the southern dungeon on my way past the map.   All dungeon maps are always rectangular in nature, vary very little; granted they seem to be using a random seed of some kind, but after 3-4 times it gets stale. There are torches on the wall, other than that, there is no decor. Character animations are limited and are only left face and right face. Also when I equip certain equipment like the helm it is barely visible or not visible at all.  There is no soundtrack, the ambience sound is almost non-existent. Occasionally I hear the drop of into a puddle in a dungeon. Again, the atmosphere of the game feels incomplete.  There are TONS of games similar to this, Gauntlet $19.99 (when not on sale, 2015 game)  (http://store.steampowered.com/app/258970/  ) is a popular game my friends play that has a multiplayer aspect, which this game does not have. Also Hammerwatch $9.99 (not on sale) which does exist, unlike what the Dev has said and exists here on Steam:      Let me describe a small experience I had playing a Troll Barbarian, which granted is pretty cool since most games fall short of providing the race/class combo which games like this should have (orignally stated above). I roll this toon, spec into two handed weapons, and I go into the trial dungeon, first door is locked, I can only kick it down, in the process of kicking the door down my huge club is broke, lol wtf ok. So basically your skill that you used to get the 2hed item is worthless and now you have to punch guys. Overall sound effects are stale, limited, and lackluster, and could be improved dramatically. If you are going to bring back a game from 1995 update date, improve it a ton. Check out Divinity Original Sin  (http://store.steampowered.com/app/373420/),  a game which was just enhanced w/ over 90+ hours of gameplay and fully AAA voiced acted. Spell casters feel bulky and there is not hotkey menu like modern games have (again you are paying for a 1995 1st addition D&amp;D type game). I have to constantly hit he escape menu to break away from the immersion of the game to open a spellbook. After some casting of the spells they are 'forgotton' (no tutorial on this at all btw, to explain this to first time players of ADOM like myself), and I have to relearn them. Which means you have to worry about carrying 100 stone tombs everywhere you go. This is a problem if you play a gnome mage (which I tried out), and tried carrying around 5 tombs plus heavy rations. Certain classes have to eat CONSTANTLY like the game should be renamed “iron ration buffet” as trolls have to eat 1-2 every dungeon level. Since food weighs a TON certain races are bogged down w/ carrying capacity issues (which only mildly exists as a nuisance in other games).  On the flip side I like rolling a quick character and just smashing through enemies in the dungeons. But other games have this pleasure of smashing AI units into the ground. Also initial encounters past the first town can kill you very easily. You see the theme here? This game has a HUGE learning curve w/ 8bit graphics. Time/reward/money do not align that well.  Why are the rations so heavy in this game? And not proportion to the character size, again another design flaw.  This game is geared towards probably ppl who are in the 30s. Why pay for this game when you can get far superior games for roughly 1-2x the price. Although if you want to step into a time machine and try to play and relive the sweet memories when you were 8 years old on your Commodore.  I feel like this game is a semi money grab at the nostalgic feels of old time gamers who played this game and who want to shell out $ for these feels.  After being frustrated for the last time, I uninstalled.  Funny, when a long time bud on Steam who saw me playing this game on messaged me:  '2015 &gt;&gt; azbolg still playing ♥♥♥♥ games'  This game is a solid 4 / 10."
333330,Song of the Myrne: What Lies Beneath,"Fun game. The humor was good and more would've been great. The character needs to have more flexibility in development, one or two points kept me from testing the waters once I realized dumping everything into Strength and Health was about the only realistic method of building a character. I haven't tried magic too much, nor missle weapons, so there is some level of balance that could be figured out for a sequel to make it more interesting, I'd love to play it."
333340,Star Rangers XE, Early Access Review
333350,Cults and Daggers,"This game has so much potential! It's a great game that will keep you playing for hours, until you realize that it's a strategic clicker, and I found that the depth that I thought was there evaporates after you get past winning the first couple of ages. I want there to be more about developing your cult as the ages progress, and elimination of the randomness of of the times inbetween the ages."
333380,SilverQuest: Gaiden, Early Access Review
333390,Tales of Aravorn: Seasons Of The Wolf,If it was more like Loren then maybe. However this is just lots of mindless fights for no reason and no plot. If there was a way to skip the fights then it would be much better but right now it is a boring game of endless stupid fights.
333430,Sinking Island,"Game is totally unplayable, as I can not get the PDA to work and the game seems to pause and you can not escape out of the game. As it was unexpensive that is ok, it would be better for sellers to check the games before release to make sure they work as they should."
333490,Replay - VHS is not dead,"Awful controls (not rebindable), too precise platforming = pain in the..  The idea of the game is nice but the execution is very poor.. not recommended unless its like 1 usd..   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKE9B1lZDpI "
333510,Isbarah,"Why doesn't anybody know about this game? Tell your friends about it. It's challenging, fast-paced, and good. The normal mode isn't too hard by the way (though the game can give you a challenge on harder difficulties, if you can take it)."
333540,Neocolonialism,"Excellent strategy game. Plays similarly to Risk, with 21st-century financial manipulation instead of the armies of the past.  Awesome to play with friends; the AI is not bad either, but I would recommend playing the game with friends for the most fun. Strategic play, and although simplified, realistic economics concerning the development of core and periphery nations and the flow of capital.  Music is excellent and sets a great tone.  Only downside is plain visuals, but that's not what you're playing a strategy game like this for. 9/10, highly recommend."
333580,"Slow Down, Bull","I can't completely recommend Slow Down, Bull due to how stressed out I get playing it. It's a fast, challenging (sometimes frighteningly so!) game. However, the way it uses Esteban's story in conjunction with the game design to inspire empathy is nothing short of fantastic. I posted a small video about that below:   https://youtu.be/WlrVsVxVwbI?t=102 "
333600,NEKOPARA Vol. 1,"Characters: 6.5/10  The main character is relatable, and his role seems to be something of a bastion of reliability, and, well... normalcy. His sister, although quite quirky, is also well written. The two main catgirls, by contrast, often behave instinctually, and can be unpredictable. To be honest I found their characters a little exaggerated at times, and difficult to engage with.  Story: 6/10  The story is long, but slow. Character develop and plot development happen in relatively discrete steps, rather than a gradual progression, which for me made immersion difficult. The development of relationships between the characters similarly seemed a little difficult to credit. The story reads like a chapter-based fairy tale or sorts. The fantastic nature of it is good, but it lacks the kind of interal consitency and attention to detail that make other stories believable.  Visuals: 7/10  The artwork is quite nice. Animation is basic. If you have a particular interest in catgirls in maid outfits, or the loli aesthetic (ribbons, bows, lace etc.), it may take your fancy.  Sound: 6.5/10  Voice acting is good. A few nice soundtracks as a backing to the story.  Overall score: 6.5/10  As a visual novel, this story just doesn't have quite enough going for it for me to recommend it.  It's worth noting here that while there is a mature content patch available for this game, it's not the product being sold here on Steam, and as such it's not what I'm basing my review on."
333640,Caves of Qud, Early Access Review
333650,Pahelika: Revelations HD,"Took a gamble on ♥♥♥, im now a Scholar..... 10/10 would be a scholar again."
333660,Towers of Altrac,"This is a generic tower defense game, chances are you basically already played it.  The graphics feel old and it's hard to differentiate from the terrain.  The UI is horrible, you get no information when you choose your character or your faction.  Graphics Card was running at 95% on the lowest setting in the title screen and the PC is highly overqualified for this game.  Multiplayer has been in 'beta' since release and endless mode is dlc.  If you're looking for a TD game there are a lot better options."
333690,Epanalepsis,"Epanalepsis is a game that rewards multiple playthroughs. It never offers easy answers to its mysteries but it begins to fall into place as you play through again and again. This is borne out in the narrative itself. Each chapter offers the player with a choice, but the results of these choices are already made clear to the player before the choice is even made. What results is a game that plays out similarly to Chris Marker's La Jetée: No matter where the story's time travellers end up, no matter what choices are made, the same cycles will repeat, much like the game's rhetorical namesake."
333760,Vintage Year,"I may change this review, but I doubt it. Even though I haven't spent alot of time playing, I can honestly say just go buy Nuclear Throne. It is better in almost every category.   Don't get me wrong - it seems the devs put their heart into this cute little piece, but I really don't think it can compete with NT and it is just so dang similiar. It just  feels  like NT.  I think this needs more content to seperate itself from NT. It can totally be done, but more work needs to happen."
333870,Feel-A-Maze,This game gives me anger issues when i can't complete a level. And doing that over and over again is not good for your health.  If you like having anger issues get the game.
333880,Braveland Wizard,"Thoroughly enjoyed the first game, sorta enjoyed this one as well. Except this time around they made this sequel even more of a Grindfest. So much so that they SHOULD just rename the game as 'Grindland Wizard' instead. It still has a good story to tell though."
33390,Zeit²,"game works well., the game has a rewind and fast foward button.  Is the game good, i suppose,  in second level after the frist boss you will encounter energy drainers those are the killer for this game I totally hate them. I can understand why they did this but honestly they drain far too much energy which you need for your sheld and health.  Your shield = health.  Health = How many shoots you have   Getting to second boss was okish.  Got to second boss and found it far too crappy to even try to use the beam shot which you get before that level, boses move around like they are trying to dodge you but your too busy to even concentrate on them because of the bullethell type game you dodging bullets just trying to get though and survive long enough to kill the boss.  Gave up, going to uninstall, Thanks for game.."
333930,Dirty Bomb,"Has it's flaws but all around it's a solid shooter. Gameplay is fast, movement is nice and classes aren't gimmicky and each one can be beaten with skill and gamesense."
333950,Medieval Engineers, Early Access Review
333970,A Druid's Duel,Assumed it was similar to games like Final Fantasy Tactics but this is completely different. Feels unique gameplay and would definitely play again.
333980,AKIBA'S TRIP: Undead & Undressed,"Ill get straight to the point. Its a Horrible PC port. The controls are clunky, the ingame screens do not tell you what keyboard or mouse botton to push and on top of that they are scatered ALL over the keyboard by defualt. Even though they could fit nicly all on the left side near the WASD controls. Not to mention the map ingame is small and you literrly, No joke, walk through loading screens every 3-5 seconds of walking. If you have a controler. Perhaps, but If you are an advent PC player like me dont buy this."
3340,AstroPop Deluxe,"If you played it as a kid like me and found it fun, go for it. Otherwise, it's a less than decent puzzle game."
334030,Epic Arena,Slow and boring
334040,Down To One,"The game has a good concept, but I couldn't play because of how horribly optimized it is."
334070,Hektor,THATS MY GAME :)
334100,Extreme Exorcism,"Fun little platformer! I found it quite addictive, very 'one more go' sorta thing. Really fun when it gets hectic with lots of the ghosts bouncing about the palce. Can imagine it is a good laugh with local coop too, almost makes me wish I had friends."
334120,Armikrog,It just wasn't fun or interesting enough for me.
334140,Roche Fusion,"This is simply fun. Engrossing, you get to challenge yourself against the leaderboard, there's co-op, there are unlock in and between games. An excellent shoot-em-up which I wholeheartedly endorse."
334190,Insanity's Blade,All the annoyingness of the arcade without actually being there!
33420,Call of Juarez: The Cartel,+)
334210,Fortified,"Fortified is a game that I really wanted to like, and don't take the dislike as strictly not enjoying it, because there IS some fun to be had in the title, but ultimately it falls short in too many areas for me to recommend when there's so many other options currently.  Let's start with the good.  The best part of the game is the general presentation. Everything has a very unique and good art style, portrayed like an old comic book would be both visually and aesthetically. There was one point in one of the earlier levels where the lighting was set up in an ingenious way, casting the shadow of incoming martians onto the wall before they rounded the corner just like so many old movie trailers used to do, it was something I was not expecting to see in a game like this and it blew me away. Whoever managed the art style of this game is great, and I do want to see them handle more projects.  The game works fine. I didn't encounter any bugs personally while me or my friends were playing.  The idea of commanding troops around the map is new and worked pretty well.  Despite my review, I did have some decent fun with the game.  The Aethetics are all done really well and really help serve the game. The issues that keep me from recommending this game are all to be found in the gameplay itself, unfortunately.  The player count balance seems off. Enemies scaling to the number of players is nothing new, but it's pretty insane in Fortified. The difference caused by adding a single player to my game was astonishing. We later added a third person, thinking that two players was a really rough spot. While it was slightly better, it still was too bogged down to really be enjoyable to anybody. The game feels balanced around two scenarios: A full party of players, or one player.  The heroes all have overlapping gear, but have a unique weapon, tower, and ultimate. I didn't level all the classes up to see their unique weapon and tower, but the ultimates are definitely not balanced well. As an example, the Space Man becomes immortal and freezes everything around him solid for several seconds while still being free to attack as normal. This is pretty good. It stalls a wave and buys time for your towers to attack. The Rocketeer, to contrast, gets infinite ammo. This may sound impressive, but it really isn't for one major reason:  The weapons don't feel effective. The first of two things your tower defense/shooter hybrid NEEDS to get right to rise above the others. Weapons don't have any OMPH to them to make them feel satisfying, and most of the weapons don't deal enough damage or have a good enough gimmick to be usable. Some of them, like the grenade launcher, can actually hurt your team by hurling aliens past your defenses. All while dealing minimal dps.  The towers are unreliable and poorly balanced: The second of the two necessities for this type of game. You don't get very much in the way of money (ESPECIALLY in two player, which had both of us starved for resources nonstop. We couldn't even try and pool our resources together, there's no way to share.) This wouldn't be a problem save for the poor tower balance. Here's an example. There's an anti-air tower in the game. It's really expensive, targets only air. Seems good, right? No. Its fire rate is so slow and its range is so small that it is entirely ineffective at handling air units unless you only have one in a wave, and thats assuming one of the turret disabling aliens doesn't off it first. It's far more effective to take the tesla trap and put it one slot higher than normal on the wall, where it proceeds to be much cheaper and more efficient as it nukes both air and ground. The air tower is a dump option in almost every way, and that isn't something you want to see in towers when your game has so few of them. This is definitely not the only case of dump towers in this game, unfortunately.  Placing traps/towers is also completely linear and uninspired: Most tower defense games get around this by making you maze, or by making the terrain pose advantages or disadvantages based off where you place it (figuring out where to place your tower so that it will have the largest fire arc, placing your tower at a certain elevation. Figuring out where to put a trap so that it hurls people into that conveniently placed bottomless pit, etc.). This isn't the case here, the maps are mostly designed of longish straightaways with sharp right angles and perfectly flat ground. There is no environmental interaction. You never really have to think about where to put your towers, and when you do it's an absolutely minimal ammount of thought.   So in the end, would I say this game is worth your time and money? Well, It depends. If you're really into the artistic direction as well as shooter/tower defense hybrids, This might be enough to pull this game through for you. If this is one of your first forays into the genre, however, I would have to recommend some of the other options before this one. Try the Orcs Must Die series or Sanctum 2 first. Perhaps even try Iron Brigade if you want to try something in the same price range. If you enjoy those games enough to still want to try this game, then go ahead and give it a shot. You'll find some enjoyment here, it's just not quite as tasty of a course as the others. "
334230,Town of Salem,"Do yourself a favor and try this game for free, you will have fun and great time playing it!"
334270,Star Traders: 4X Empires,"Meh. Crappy interface, dated graphics. I just can't get into this game."
334290,Gates of Horizon,"I was playing to Eve Online 5 days ago, and I didnt like too much, even I already uninstalled it. But finally I have found a fun space MMORPG game with no montly fees, where you can trade/combat/mining, and you can have various agents to do whatever you want, so you arent limited to only one character. I only have played a few hours and I find it very fun and addictive game. And this game was released a few days ago, so Its very nice start playing to a game since beginning  Im editing it, because game looks dead now, no more updates in almost a year."
334300,Fake Colours,"Well, at least they tried. Games like this may only stand out if they have good design, but here we've got just an unimpressive UI and flat shaded rgb blocks. Nothing worth this price."
334410,Jump,"Fun idea, but judder and movement mechanic will likely make a decent number of users sick. It needs menu options turn off the post FX like SSAO and whatever else there is so I can tune my performance. I'm waiting for a performance update before playing more: the judder gave me a headache."
334420,Out There: Ω Edition,"So I was playing this game for a while and loving it. The concept is cool. It's a bit basic, but you do get a sense of being alone in the galaxy and have to make very difficult choices to survive.   Then I was watching some videos of No Mans Sky and thought to myself, 'Does anyone else realize how similar these games are? Are they made my the same company?' As far as I can tell, they aren't made by the same people but take a look at them.   They both have: • weird relics in them that help you out in some way... like learning a language.  • a very similar periodic table of elements. • obviously space travel to/from planets and solar systems with occasional stops for materials. and many more similarities I found incredibly odd.  You don't need to upvote or even like this review, but at least let me know what you think about this. I can't be the only one who see's the resemblance can I?"
334470,Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,Let's hope your not stuck on an island with this game...
334560,Square Heroes,Pretty cool!
33460,From Dust,"My recommendation is DO NOT BUY.  If you didn't notice in the fine print: 3rd-party DRM: Ubisoft Online Service  That's UPlay, Ubisoft's always-on DRM with a separate patcher (for the DRM), separate updater (for the game) and separate account and login. I haven't managed to get to the actual game part yet thanks to all the Ubisoft crud and hoops they want you to jump through before they will allow you to load the game.  (And yes, you will see three separate 'Now patching...' prompts with progress bars before you get to the UPlay login screen.)  As a side note, the UPlay username 'WhyDoIHaveToDoThis?' is already taken. So are 'WhyGodWhy', 'WhyDoIBother', 'UbisoftAreIdiots', 'UPlayIsStupid', and 'KillMeNow'. At that point I got bored and mashed the keyboard. So look me up, I'm sazwethiujolk on UPlay. (Also, UPlay requires your birth date but limits it to an earliest year of 1910, requiring those of us born before that date to lie in answer to the question.)"
334620,Soccertron,Simple and addicting Pong-type game. Not my kind of game but it holds my interest.
334690,Squirreltopia,Think of how much you hate ice levels in mario before you buy this. momentum makes no sense half the time you stop mid air and drop or you keep sliding mid air 'momentum' makes you slide everywhere the jump key doesnt like to work if youre going fast/sliding/jumped recently (rapid jump needed to beat 1-3) the awful combination of sliding and not being able to jump enimies have hitboxes that can kill you before theyre visable (1-3) I found spots you can fall through ground texture (1-5)
334710,Ilamentia,"' Designed as torture, agressive in all the aspects : visually, sonically, mechanically.  Played... Is that the right word ? Faced it for half an hour and gave up, i don't find pleasure in pain.  Really I didn't like it.'  This was my first evaluation of Ilamentia, didn't get past the first impression and quitted.  I gave it 2 more hours and discovered another game, an addictive one, with a hundred of twisted puzzle and some nice visuals that changes through levels.  What i found aggressive the first time was the perpetual shakiness of everything that got me confused and on edge making all of the other aspects also agressive, turning on the 'Motion sickness' option made the game more readable and a lot less shaky.  So, to correct my first impression, soundtrack fits well and gameplay mechanics are simple and efficient. For now I like it."
334830,Entropy Rising,"Quite pretty. Actually nicer looking than portal in a lot of ways but missing the style and sense of humor. The platforming controls are pretty good, but the puzzles are only average and I'm often left wondering what to do due to the slim tutorials. 6/10"
334840,Drive to Hell,My friend gave me this game and I was able to beat it (on normal difficulty) in 2 sittings. I'm sure the other difficulties are much harder to beat. The music in this game is quite relaxing and I find it quite ironic since you're driving through hell killing monsters.
334850,1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum,"Fantastic visual novel style RPG. Has a great storyline and plenty of options to keep game play interesting. The amount of time spent grinding can be frustrating, but I felt the story and characters more than made up for it. I like the Steampunk lite setting, and the wide array of characters that Sadie meets in the course of the game. Overall, definitely worth playing."
334960,Cell HD: emergence,imposible want my money back!
334980,Into Blue Valley,How do I go about getting the 25 minutes of wasted time back? The whole time I thought that there was a sense of danger past the battery on the camera going dead. I was incredibaly disapointed. I might as well have taken a camcorder and walked outside of my house to get the same feeling of uselesness that I experienced at the end.
3350,Bejeweled Deluxe,"It's a lot of fun. It's a simple and classic match-3 puzzle game. Is it something I'm going to sit down and play for dozens or even hundreds of hours? No. Is it a good game? Yes, very much so."
335000,Tormentum - Dark Sorrow,"This game is very atmospheric and has a deep, though short story. The art is outstanding, I absolutely loved the style, the best I've ever seen in games. I played through it three times to see all the possible outcomes from my desicions, and I find it good that an adventure game is not straightforward and inspires you to play through it several times. The couple downsides I noticed are the overall shortness of the story and the fact you're boldly presented with all the solutions to the puzzles, the game feels like it's oriented on the dumbest of players, and I don't like that feel.  Overall, I give it a strong 6/10 and recommend it to everyone who likes phylosophical and morale-driven games."
335010,Steam and Metal,No Thanks!
335050,World Of Leaders,"The worst game I have ever played. Do not buy, reasons listed in all the other reviews (which I honestly wish I had read when I bought this game) 22/04-2016 update: The devs seem to be finished with the game at this point. I don't remember seeing an update in the queue but there may have been a few. Still can't recommend it - the few updates can't possibly have made it much better.   Please do not buy this game unless you feel like wasting 4.99€. You won't play it for long."
335070,VRC PRO,Why do they call this the Steam edition yet the new steam controller does NOT work at all on it? They need a patch or update to fix this issue then deserve to call it the Steam edition after I paid $45 for it and can ONLY use my keyboard to play it right now!
335090,Goscurry,"It's not an easy game. Unless you are really dedicated to it you won't be spending a lot of time in it, so I'd recommend picking it up when it's on sale."
335100,Dwarf Tower,"This game IS good if you like the classic game of battleship, and you have friends to play with. But even then, it can get boring quickly if this isn't your thing.  But the single player game is lacking, and I found the AI not challenging at all.  Recommended for some, but not for most, so I have to go for a thumbs down on this one.... but, if a sequel comes out (there's a little bit of talk about it), I for one will definitely check it out."
335120,Serpent in the Staglands,"I would refund this game as i feel it is of such poor quality it is not fit for sale, however i will just eat the loss. Appartently this game was made by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ couple, dont feel they deserve to loose money because i did not do my research on this game first."
335190,200% Mixed Juice!,"I game I never quite found the interest to play. It looks cute, and was enjoyable to a degree during my time with it. For fans of the gameplay, this could be a great time."
33520,Tropico,"It's an interesting to see the series develop from the original Tropico up to the more modern Tropico 3. Tropico 3 is certainty more friendly than the original. However, Tropico 2 and even Tropico 3 refuses to run in a window. I can't possibly recommend this with such a standard feature in PC games missing."
335200,ManaCollect,"I remember spending hours playing minesweeper way back. So when I read about this game being based on the concept of minesweeper but more players I was intrigued. Are you curious too? Well, play it, it’ll be a refreshing discovery. You’ll enjoy it (more if you play with a controller, because of diagonal movement)."
335210,Rift's Cave, Early Access Review
335220,But to Paint a Universe,"It's a pretty fun puzzle game when it works. Due to some of the bugs being pretty annoying (the fullscreen/windowed button doesnt work meaning you have to alt enter to make it windowed, and the occasional disappearing mouse cursor) I would suggest to wait for a sale.  My full overview and opinions on this game is in my Steam Backlog series:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC0GwRWmuvA "
335240,Transformice,"Let me start by saying this game is not for everyone. Very chill, sit back and interact with the community.  - The base gameplay is a platformer. - The tutorial does not cover everything you need to know (for example wall jumps, skill points, etc.) so you need to be able to figure things out on your own well, or at least be able to get and interpret answers from other people.  - It is a long term game, just meant to suck up free time.  - It is all about the community, and interacting with others.  - It is skill based as far as gameplay goes, but the thing that sets you up in the higher end of the community is how long you have been playing and items of prestige.  - The community has been around for at least 5 years now, if not more, so it is well developed.  All in all, not bad. I don't play anymore because I have other things I like to spend my time doing, but not a bad game!"
335300,DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Good freaking game, deserves all the hype, its a crime of you don't buy it while it's on sale."
335310,Eisenbahn X,this game is in german not the game i recomend for people who knows english unless u can speak german i payed for the game big misteak. it looks good like Train simulater or Trainz 2013 but if this game is on steam they should be an english verson of this game .
335320,Bet On Soldier,"Graphics seemed pretty good to me considering the year it came out at(2005).   Controls is a little awkward and by little I mean quite a lot. It will take time to get adjust to them. The sensitivity is not like most other shooter games.   Voice acting is pretty messed up as well.   Fights overall are pretty tough and intense but in a good way. Though, You may find yourself killed by same enemy again and again as some BOS fights can get really tough making you go into tactics rather than running and gunning.  The storyline isn't much good imo. Plus, It has been executed in a confusing manner but still easily understandable. I liked the ending part(Not gonna give spoilers but not a 'and they lived happily ever after' game). I found story to be a boring tbh but that is just me.   The theme of the game is pretty cool. Original and interesting setting for the game to happen.   Economic system of the game is pretty interesting imo. I really liked it. Blindly spraying or charging on multiple enemies without engineer have its consequences. It encourages head-shots, multiple kills and so on with less and less spraying.   Weapons are quite limited imo but the already existing ones are quite enough to suit all game play styles. It is quite customizable.   NPC can be quite dumb at times tho but that can actually make you laugh.   Did ran into some bugs while playing and some mission-breaking ones as well but nothing a re-load can't fix. Just load the last save file and kaboom.   I found companions not to be of much help apart from engineer. The rest while seemingly interesting didn't do much.   There are some cons, yes but I believe the gameplay and the game design overwhelms it.   If you have some extra bucks lying around or you find the game on sale, Buy it. But if not, Then don't worry - You aren't missing out on something like a legend. Game is good but not like legend stuff(Tho it can entertain you for many hours)."
335330,Brick-Force,"Started playing the game , ears started bleeding by the music 10/10"
33540,Dawn of Magic 2,"This is a clunky game with poor to annoying voice acting, poor interace and dated graphics.  The actual single player rpg maybe ok, but its so poorly executed (or a product of its era) that I'm not going to play it long enough to find out.  Even at 80% off, this is not a bargin, it just belongs in the bin."
335420,ルナティックドーン 前途への道標,"With the English patch (check the discussion forum), this is currently the most easily understood Lunatic Dawn game in the store. The Legends Pack also has patches for each of its games, but this one is more complete from what I've seen so far.  Passage of the Book is an open-ended, party-based dungeon-crawling RPG. It begins by having you create a world according to a few simple parameters, and then you're thrown right into it with some basic equipment and money. You recruit other party members via inns and through talking to other adventurers, and over time improve all your characters by fulfilling requests and plundering dungeons. There is no overarching narrative; rather, you're left to do as you like and become as famous/infamous as you please.  Creating a character invovles selecting certain criteria from a small window and selecting someone from a list of generated results. Age and gender can affect one's stats in different ways - a mid-20's character will generally be stronger than a much older one, but an older one may have much more charisma, for example. There aren't strict classes as much as there are stats which determine what kinds of actions a character is best at performing - a warrior is going to prioritize strength over intelligence, a mage will do the opposite, so on and so forth. Again, very freeform and the details are largely up to the player. Party members are NOT created by the player - they are recruited once the game starts.  Passage of the Book is tough. Enemies can be very powerful and there's little indication as to what kinds of enemies will be in different dungeons, but with persistence and a full party you can usually make it out ok. Equipment is straightforward - bought at shops, can be improved X number of times, and different folks are better with different weapons. Inns allow you to talk to various individuals, including your own party members, as well as purchase supplies. Lamps are especially important for dungeons - you can get stuck in the dark without one! There are also item shops, temples, training areas (where you raise your own skills in exchange for money), and an information broker through whom you can search for info on specific people and places.   Battle is a turn-based affair similar to other Japanese console RPG's, in that you select an action then watch as everyone takes their turns. The difference, though, is you only have primary control over your own character - your party acts independently, but can be encouraged to focus on particular enemies or utilize certain strategies (this is largely similar to the other Lunatic Dawn games in the Legends Pack). After battle, loot is divided amongst your party and can be won through a competitive game. Once divided, loot belongs to each person, not to the player exclusively, and dividing loot is also what helps maintain cohesion within your party (members can become dissatisfied and leave).   Overall, it's a very open, freeform experience that I've never really encountered elsewhere. I'd almost call Passage of the Book more of a sim than a traditional dungeon crawler. Either way, it's a unique experience that fans of old-school dungeon crawling will appreciate, as the mechanics are solid and the sense of accomplishment grows very quickly. Definitely recommend giving this one a go."
335430,Grimoire: Manastorm,   Early Access Review
335440,Dungeon Shooter 2,"File this one under 'bad'.  It may have potential if they could convert the controls to be a twin-stick controller scheme but as-is you can only use the mouse to aim and WSAD to move around. The gameplay is not very fun.   The quality of the game is extremely minimal, this is the absolute least amount of work you could put into a 3D game. It doesn't seem 'unfinished' as much as it just seems like they didn't spend a whole lot of time on it. You can actually play any level of the game right off the bat, you don't need to progress through it to unlock anything. It's actually a really good thing because if you find a level to be rediculous you can just move onto the next one but I tried the first 3 and I'm just not feeling it.   In the level list, I figured '00' would be a sort of training level, since the rest are just numbered 01, 02, 03 and so on. In the '00' level, there's a big minigun turret around the first corner. You can't seem to hurt it, bullets don't seem to affect it much, but there are treasure boxes beside it. When you walk over a treasure box it will open it, but you don't instantly have the ability to pick it up for about a second or so, you basically have to circle around it 3 or 4 times. Well the gun will take you out much faster than that, so it makes picking up any loot basically annoying. Trying to kill enemies is pretty bad too, it's a shame they didn't try to lure me in with any slow progressing 'fun' parts instead of basically throwing the player to the dogs on the first levels and having a horrible control scheme to boot.   "
335450,Curse of the Assassin,"A bit drawn out and goes into too much detail sometimes, but just as good as the prequel.  Having a partner to team up with was a nice addition to the combat system.  (Still needs a narrator and vocie acting! =P)"
335460,An Assassin in Orlandes,Very simple game in the good old 'turn to page 150 in this book' style. It's not terrible. Still didn't enjoy it a whole lot. It's also clearly designed for mobile and not ported well (it still says 'tap in the middle of the screen' for example).
33550,Time of Shadows,"Not a good game. A magic centric game seems like it could be of some appeal and this game doesn't do it well enough. There's no draw into the game, it's just dull and with no customization at all, it's hardly an RPG; so why does it advertise itself as one? Because it wants to sell, that's why. With muddy graphics, too few graphics options, poor controls, character classes that aren't fun to play, boring combat, crappy narrative... there's just too much to delve into what's wrong with this game, even for how little I played."
335570,Back To Life 3,"This game can actually be good, but the controls are TERRIBLE. Also, the game would crash from time to time. I really like the concept and the graphics so I would still recommend it, but it only barely got my accolades."
335660,CAFE 0 ~The Drowned Mermaid~,"Super repetitive and also extremely short. Character interactions were awkward. ...like super awkward .-. Having the CV be an additional DLC is also a bummer.  Art is also kinda wonky, but that's me xD  Meh...  So there's 6 endings; a good end &amp; a bad end for both of the guys, a general bad end, and the true end (where you learn the most story-wise). You need to get all the endings (not including the general bad end) in order to get the true end. :o"
335670,LISA,"The game has really funny and moving dialogue. If you like story driven games, definitely pick this up!  The combat is really unique and fun but it took me a little bit to get used to it. That was probably the only downside of the game but once I got used to it, it was really easy and enjoyable. Just played through the DLC and definitely recommend it as well!"
335690,dUpLicity ~Beyond the Lies~,Incredibly ugly arts ....
33570,Patrician III,  Game doesn't work in Windows 10. Tried every mod and fix I can find online and still won't play. I did receive the game as part of a package deal with something else (I forget).
335700,I am weapon: Revival,##### 62 minutes playtime as of release of review (Steam didn't count most of it). This review is for the game version released in 28 July 2016 and may not accurately reflect the current state of the game. #####     Overview 
335770,Tkl Online,This game should be in pre alpha it is not an online game and as far as i can tell there is only a starter area.
335790,Words for Evil,A mixed recommendation. The game is simple and fun but unfortunately suffers from lack of clarity when it comes to equipment and the damage being dealt/taken due to your focus being on the bottom half of the screen. However with that being said the actual gameplay mechanics are well done and satisfying.
33580,The Great Art Race,tried it... removed it...
335820,Dream Of Mirror Online,Lots of Nostalgia but this game just... sucks.
335830,Distant Star: Revenant Fleet,"Distant Star: Beta Fleet  Yup, you heard me, you are part of the beta tester fleet. Hot out of heels of 'Early Access / Alpha' Distant Star strives to be your favorite games brother but turns out to be your cousins' sister-in-law's brother no one gives two ♥♥♥♥♥ about just that they are somehow related; if that makes any sense.   Really what I am trying to say is that DS doesn't really excel at what everyone compares it to: Homeworld and FTL. The progression and storytelling method borrows from FTL but other than that, it's nothing like FTL. While combat I wouldn't even compare to HW, sorry. Honestly, the combat is really rudimentary, boring, and dare I say, shoddy. It's totally unpolished and lacking. You control a maximum of 5 ships with potential active abilities, cycle aggro, and try not to die. There were more than a few times I encountered a bug where I couldn't select nor move my ships. Pretty much dead in the water, auto attack and buffs.   Randomized space encounters are unbalanced and does not feel rewarding when victorious. You'll run into your fair share of defend, capture, destroy scenarios that are really lacking any creativity. Sometimes you'll encounter waves of enemy fleets otherwise units scattered across a big map you are forced to traverse. Nothing to sing home about.  Average replay value. It's rogue-like so yeah your encounters along the way will vary but nothing really pushing you to go the extra mile once you've beaten the game. Unfortunately, there is no unlocks nor bonuses. More customizations and varying ships would have been nice, perhaps modifiers or challenges.  It's fun for the first couple hours but that's all to it? Given it's current state and outlook, I cannot recommend this at any price."
335840,Goats on a Bridge,"Got it in a bundle so I didn't pay for this game by itself, but I did check it out and I think it is totally worth the price tag. "
335890,Nanofights,"You only start with beginner's deck as usual, and you would need to register in their website to do online transaction for more cards and/or trade with other players, which i didn't register so i couldn't confirm on that.  The game itself is interesting, however, the tutorial doesn't teach you much and the server is basically empty. It is just you and the AI. With only 1 deck to play with, and only with the AI, it bores you down very fast.  It would be great if there are more players in the server to play with, so the card fights will be more interesting, witty and fun. Until then, i couldn't recommend anyone at this price point, even though i got this game for free..."
335900,Angels of Fasaria: Version 2.0,"I was looking forward and had great expectations for this game, I was utterly disappointed.The most annoying aspects were the battles, you were minding your own business walking on the map and suddenly a battle breaks loose, with no warning, you couldn't see any beasts on the map before you were forced into battle so you were not prepared.Also a idiotic feature, the waste of space houses and endless roads, everything was repetitive and boring. I tried to like it but it gave me no chance.My eagerness for exploration was utterly smashed by my frustration with those endless boooring battles out of the blue. I could continue to state why I dislike this game, anyway if you want a decent 2D RPG I recommend visiting Aveyond Kindom, I played a lot of their games and not once was I this disappointed."
335920,Ephemerid: A Musical Adventure,"I don't usually review much, but I had to review this game. Ephemerid: A Musical Adventure is a creative art piece with classic rock music that will make your guitar skills sound phony and ridiculous as soon you start clicking to the rhythm and embarking on a journey of life as a little mayfly.  It's a simple point and clicking game, an interactive story, it resembles paper cut animation, yet it is enough to tangle you until the very end (worked for me!).  It's not a long game: an hour and a half, maybe, is enough to complete it.  I'd say that the main positive aspect here is the story. Then its papercraft concept. Music tends to be quite repetitive and overwhelming to people who don't appreciate tons of guitars. It was fine to me, though some were a bit cheesy (but that point is related to one's musical taste). Artwork is simple but it's enough for this game. A game like this has a lot of possibilities to offer in terms of game design and interactivity, I confess that I was expecting more variety.  Buuuut.. in my humble opinion, it's a beautiful little, interactive, magical experience and it deserves more recognition. Not only because it's reasonably cheap, also because it will make your day better  *tends to return from time to time*   If you like guitars, point and clicking rhythm and narrative altogether, it's a must! If not..  ..you'll love it for its story.  feels. feels everywhere  (Note that this is just my opinion and nothing more than the experience I've had while playing this game)"

33600,Broken Sword 2 - the Smoking Mirror: Remastered,"Great game, great story. Although it is a 'sequel' to Broken Sword 1, it is actually a totally different story with new elements. The 2D gameplay continues but i wouldn't change it! The puzzles were somewhat easier than in Broken Sword 1.  10/10"

336090,Sky Mercenaries,"Shoot em up game. Bullets are hard to see, graphics need polishing. "
33610,Broken Sword 3 - the Sleeping Dragon,"As always great game, great story. Loved the crossovers with Broken Sword 1 story! The new 3D gameplay style makes the game a bit more interesting than BS 1 and 2. Although this game has no 'Hints' section, with the way it is designed you don't really need them. Favourite puzzle, the Anubis - Horus!!!  11/10"
336110,Bloody Streets,Is a fun short game. The game is alright but my game was crashing after playing 4 maps.
336130,Shardlight,2 hours into the game and I'm quitting. I feel like I've solved only one real puzzle so far. The story up to this point is weak and doesn't get me hooked. Overall doesn't give clear goals and there really is no sense of accomplishment in this game. This really isn't in the league of Gemini Rue or Primordia. Very disappointing.
336150,Virtual Pool 4,Pros: Feels like real pool. Is certainly the most realistic pool game out there.  Cons: Mildly offensive/unPC. Poor difficulty ramping for the AI. Poor AI.
336160,Monsters!,"yo man this game is mad tight dawg. at first i was like, this game cant be that cool, but then i was like damn this game is cool. if you got a spare 2.49 laying around, pop that in your disc drive and buy this game. 2 thumbs up and wet kiss from this guy."
33620,Crash Time III,  Good game if you're bored.  8/10

336230,Way to Go!,Its not Shenmue but it will do for now

336610,Outcast 1.1,"This game may be just to old and the cover you see here is nothing like the graphics you see its landscape detail is old school real old and characters also, it works fine but get tired of it fast the controls work a little funny and the map is poor just heard to know what next, i get board fast of games that take to long to explore with not much to do.. but to be fair i will later do a full update review of this game do to i had played not long on it..."
336630,Crash And Burn Racing,"-8/10-  This is a very addictive game that gets you playing for AGES to beat your highscore. The graphics are not fantastic, but the gameplay is good, the driving is not stiff which makes for good gameplay, the song in the background is cool (i don't know about you, but when the beat drops ALWAYS blow up a bomb :) ) and it has cool power-ups. The other racers you encounter and have to destroy, just makes this very addictive!"
336670,HIT,I whant to play this game so bad but it dose not work
336680,TREBUCHET,"This shouldn't be on Steam, it's a flash game. Everything is just bad...."

336700,Elastrix,"It's a very simple game. From the trailer, you should know if this is the type of game for you or not. Personally it isn't for me, but I can see the charm and I think there's potential fun to be had. I think with a few changes it could be significantly improved:   1)  The cannon shoots in a fixed position meaning the levels are straight forward and simple trial and error. If you could choose where to fire, such as in an obvious inspiration for this game Peggle, it would make the game more involved than simply dragging lines, clicking a button and hoping for the best.   2)  A back button. As it is if you make a mistake you have to reset the level or precisely click on an individual band which is a little tedious. Furthermore, it would be nice if you could hold and drag left mouse to connect multiple points, rather than having to click each time.   3)  More levels would be nice as you can finish the game within 2 hours. There's only 60; 30 standard and 30 anti-gravity levels. There's also a 'Trixball' mode which is very much so like Peggle but as it is always played on exactly the same level it gets old very quick.  While it is cheap, there's plenty of other games that are also just as cheap or even free that offer more involvement and replayability than this game, such as (you guessed it!) Peggle. As a result it's tough to recommend. But it's not bad, and it's still probably good for kids or to waste time at work but just don't expect to get much out of it."
336710,Supreme League of Patriots Issue 2: Patriot Frames,"The writing, voice acting, music, visiuals are all quite good but at the same time they are so boring and bland I just don't get it. For me this dwells in the same league as visual novels. FastClicker.exe through the game using guide to get 100% achievements and don't even bother to understad what's is going on. Nah for all 3 parts."
336730,Supreme League of Patriots Issue 3: Ice Cold in Ellis,"The writing, voice acting, music, visiuals are all quite good but at the same time they are so boring and bland I just don't get it.

Nah for all 3 parts."
336760,Pilot Brothers,"As a massive fan of point and click games, I have to say this is one of the worst I have ever played. I would skip this one and go for something else. 2/10"
336770,Pilot Brothers 2,"So, a humerous Russian point and click from 1998? Alrighty then.  Normally, with this kind of game, the main questions are about the story and puzzles, but in this case, there's a matter of basic functionality. This game is old. Modern features like canceling a movement or skipping a line of dialogue are not here, so you will have to wait a few seconds every time they shake their head or say 'I don't understand', and then wait a few more just because. There are also some scenes where things are moving and it doesn't consistantly react to clicks.  The story is quite short, but mildly amusing, with minimal dialogue and some decent animation. Some of the cutscene text hasn't been translated, so I'm not sure if I missed a joke or two there.  The puzzles are a mixed bag, though nothing great. Some of the puzzles require swapping things around or trial and error until you find a solution (or give up and watch the video guide included), and with the clunky interface, this can be a slow, repetitive process.  Overall, the game just doesn't meet modern expectations. The animation is good, but unless you are willing to put up with an outdated interface, it's not worth it."
336780,Pilot Brothers 3: Back Side of the Earth,"Nearly half of the levels are missing and the game plays much slower because it's evidently a poorly optimized port of the mobile version. They could have just reworked the already finished PC version from 11 years ago, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
336790,KWAAN,"It's really annoying that there's no decent controller support (or rebindable keys...) and there are no single player worlds.  I honestly think this game would go much farther if it had just a little bit more effort put into it. I mean, I like to play it, but can I honestly say that this game is even finished, let alone worth your money in its current state? I'm afraid not."
33680,Eversion ,"It's a really cool 2d platformer. It's kinda short depending on how much time you want to put into it, but you could easily finish the game in about 20 minutes. There is a secret ending that requires a bit more time to put into it. Definitely worth checking out."
336840,Color Guardians,        YouTube™ Video:  Color Guardians: 4K MAXED settings - 4-Way Titan X SLI&nbsp;
336930,Redux: Dark Matters,"If you have played R-type, dont give this game a miss.   As a horizontal shooter n recently steam published. wAited 2 years for this becos it was a Dreamcast only version.  The graphics smooth, controls fluid, weapons wah everything.But the force bit cannot detach ahhhhh. Shump Collectors shouldnt give this a miss thats all i can say"
337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"Man, this should have been a great game.  From an actual gameplay perspective, it's one of the best games I've played all year. The stealth mechanics are very well implemented, all of the new augmentations are pretty damn cool and offer you new ways of tackling objectives, and the game looks fantastic. The performance issues that a lot of people are reporting are a serious detriment and hopefully Sqeenix continues to improve on that as time goes on, but overall the game plays very well. It's not perfect, of course, with some wonky AI, off-kilter animations, and sometimes questionable dialogue, but Mankind Divided does an excellent job of being an engaging, fun experience that is worth exploring fully.   And then the ending shows up half-way through the game.   I wish I was exaggerating but the game suddenly just stops and you're left with not only an unsatisfying ending but also an unskippable credit sequence that goes on for about twenty minutes. It's incredibly awkward and feels completely artificial. It's like the developers literally cut the game in half and we'll be seeing the second part for another $60 in a year or so. All other problems I may have had with the game are irrelevant because the ending is legitimately   that bad.   It's such a damn shame.   I haven't played any of the Jensen's Stories or even touched whatever Breach is so I can't comment on either of those things, but the fact that there's already a story DLC out for this within a month of release makes me think that Squeenix hacked up what should have been one of the best games of the year in favor of selling it back to us piece by piece. I wish I could give this game a 'Maybe' rather than a simple 'Yes' or 'No' rating because what's here is legitimately terrific, but alas I'm going to have to not recommend this game for the time being simply because that I feel rather robbed for paying full price for half a game."
337040,Deadnaut,"I really like the space genre, and the game sounded quite cool. I think the concept is nice, and even the minimalist graphics work just fine. But maybe it's just too difficult to have much fun with it. I played for a little while and just didn't really enjoy it all that much."
337070,"Dimmdrive :: Gaming Ramdrive @ 10,000+ MB/s","Probably very useful for older systems with a large amount of ram.  This app is very stable in my system. (W10). I don't have any complaints about the app itself. My system is rather fast already and I did not notice any great performance gains. AMD 8320, 32 GB ddr3 (1600). I run most games off my storage drive (3TB 7200 WD Black). Running dimm drive might be great on an older system provided they have enough ram to create a suitable size virt. drive to be useful. I bought this to test with Shadow Tactics as the load times for that game are horrendous, but there was little to no performance gain from what I can tell. I am giving this a thumb up due to the stability of the software compared to others I have tried. I think an application on a laptop might be a better test of its effectiveness."
337110,Bard to the Future,THIS GAME MADE ME GET EXTREME AGGRESION ATTACKS. 10/10 WOULD SLIP ON ICE AND FRIKKING DIE AGAIN
337130,Bosch's Damnation,"Beautiful point and click adventure game that is very light on plot and puzzles besides simple inventory- based or 'find the key' ones. While the photo-based graphics are immersive, the large world could have been utilized better with more interaction points (there were suprisingly few for a rendered world that large). I do not know a lot of Swedish history, so several of the museum locales were interesting (mannequins?!) but I could only interact with things in 1-2 rooms out of 6 (seriously there were whole rooms with nothing to do in them). The puzzles in these locales weren't related to any of the objects in the rooms, aside from a random abacus and Bosch painting, so could have been done anywhere. It would have been nice to have the puzzles better utilize these locations (maybe I could have learned something). Would recommend in the under $6 range."
337150,Sentinels of the Multiverse,Pros: Great Artwork Long Challenging Battles Well-crafted AI  Cons: No Campaign/Story Mode Game is absolutely crying for Voice effects  8/10  
337210,Royal Bounty HD,"Its a pretty good game, Fun to play but hard to learn. The way to move is buggy and combat is weird but the free world and choice of paths is really nice and its overall very funy defiantly worth the $5!"
337220,Guild Commander,"This game seems like a really poor port of a game one would play on a tablet, with its only saving grace that there are no microtransactions. It becomes monotonous after a couple of hours and I found myself easily bored.  Edit: It would appear I've only played minutes, but the game made me feel so bored it seemed like hours."
337270,Ostrich Island,"This is the game of our generation; the Mona Lisa of ostrich based strategy games. Play this game be prepared to have everything you thought you knew about ostriches, islands, video games, and foundationalist epistemology turned upside down. Welcome to the renaissance."

Gains a whole new depth when listening to Eurobeat at max volume while going 80 mph dodging the oncoming traffic on a winding path of thin ice in your B-train filled with strong acid, while IT'S A BURNING DESIRE is blasting from the speakers."
337350,Flywrench,"Definitely reccomending it If you like fast paced games where you need a lot of tries to complete the levels, this is for you"
337360,Dead Island Retro Revenge,"fun and has potential, but it needs work. Like an in depth by chapter walk through of enemies, combos, strategies, etc. Much clearer hitboxes"
337410,Karos,"International common language is not English in russian think they do not know . I would've German . The game is beautiful , but just bad russian possible"
337420,Final Dusk,"Well. Its a kid's game I'll give you that. Other than the character design, I'd say 5/10."
337450,Dream Tale,"Puzzle platformer that relies on skill and a keen eye. Very fun, beautiful level art.  Spoilers below! - Yellow star = points - Red star = small floating jump - Purle star = big floating jump - Green star = float - white star = enemies wont hurt you (tip: use the red and purple stars for short boosts so you can get higher/further) The red/purple/green star replace your ability to jump normally - beware of this! At several points in the game you better use up the abilities before proceeding, as you need your normal jump.  Collect 19 keys to enter level 20, which is the last level. Not sure what the '4 worlds' in the game description is supposed to mean. It seems that theres only 20 levels total, but maybe you unlock more when you collect all the puzzle pieces?  Doing a 20-exit run (19 keys + last level) will take you probably between 1 and 2 hours. The full price might be a little steep, but worth it in my opinion. It's still less than going to the movies for example. "
33750,Prison Tycoon 4: Supermax,"I have never in my life wanted to make a prison as much as I have when I thought about buying this game six years ago. Now that I own it, I regret every cent I payed."
33760,Amelia Earhart,"I bought this game mainly due to the subject matter. Although, they may have took some liberties with the story, it really does follow along quite well with history, for beginners. The game is very short though and I was hoping for more history to be involved with the game. The graphics are pretty standerd of most HOG. The puzzle were excessively easy though, but I actually did enjoy the hidden object scenes as they were a bit more challenging then most HOG's I have played.   I can't give this a thumbs up however as it just needed some more story as well as the puzzles were way too easy. As far as the subject matter there is a bit to learn if you haven't read or seen much about Earhart. Otherwise nothing is new news to be sure as I have watched documentaries about the findings on the island in question many years ago but we still haven't had definitive answers yet. I give the game a 5/10 moslty because I'm glad someone did a HOG on an interesting historical person and mystery and also the HOG part of the game was a nice challenge."
337630,Bermuda,"I haven't read a lot of visual novels, but each time I give one a chance, I am let down.  The voice acting in this is not convincing. It feels forced and out of place. The characters are boring. The story is odd and does not flow well. Fortunately, this one was not plagued with grammatical erros like some I have seen.  Also, how in the world can you make a story about underwater aliens and still throw in how awesome god is every minute or two? It isn't hard to mention that character is 'god-fearing' or religious without cramming that down our throats.  "

337680,Star Hammer: The Vanguard Prophecy ,"Awesome, well rounded and surprisingly in -deapth strategy. This is really how space tactics ought to be done. The ony thing i could ever wish from this game that IMHO could improve on the formula would be a sandbox mode with an open map instead of the mission by mission campaign. Now dont take me the wrong way, i enjoyed the campaign all right, m just saying that sandbox approach could do miracles for the game's replayability.... oh well, maybe in the sequel. &lt;nudge nudge&gt;... come on Devs, &lt;wink, nudge nudge&gt;"

337720,The Sea Will Claim Everything,"A splendid adventure game. I almost quit in the first area (because it was so weird and the music was repetitive) but I'm glad I got back to it! The pace of the game is really calm and colourful, so I cannot recommend it to my neighbour Grimface Hurrypants."

337760,Decisive Campaigns: The Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris,"One of the best stragety games, I have played on a while. Deep Complexity and yet an easy interface to get to your goals. Well done!!"
337820,The Mims Beginning,"TL;DR: Supremely average game which you should only bother with if, like me, you were jonesing for a god game and are ready to be disappointed.  I won't whinge about the lack of a save-game function, nearly everyone else has done so and I have to agree with them. Its an RTS and it needs a save game, lets be honest.  What I will whinge about is the mechanics of the game. You're a god that has little to no control over what's going on, you have to spend your time micromanaging the stupidest details of the game, e.g., using your godly powers to exterminate worms from eating your fruit. Your direct control over the Mims is minimal and whatever AI they're driven by is poor enough to frustrate you while you wait around for resource-collection whereby they collect bananas from around the island for the central-juicer.  The plot is meh, the 'humour' is of the terrible teletubbies variety, and the gameplay is largely about resource management with little reward.  This is no way comparable to Populous or Blank-n-White and balancing your banana and astro-chicken output with the impeding worm-infestation probability isn't strategy, its accounting."
337850,Avernum 2: Crystal Souls,"Sadly, it’s the same as with Avernum: escape from the pit……I had hope that it will be good as the original Avernum 2 with more RPG elements like Exile 2: crystal souls…..but it's not as good as the originals. Compare to its original version, Exile 2, the original Avernum 2 is more streamlined version in a better way. But this version of Avernum (Avernum 2: Crystal Souls) is dumbed down: the skill system is skill tree without any good reason, lack of skills, the food management aspect is very stupid (you use food to resurrect characters in resting areas like campfires), poor weapon variation (no one handed spear, no rock throwing, no arrows, no clubs, no two-handed swords, lack of darts), less spells, you cannot bash doors and no recruitable NPCs. Also, death has no consequences because your dead party members will always revive when you enter a friendly town for free unlike in the original Avernum 2 and Exile 2 where you had to pay a priest to revive them for a huge sum of money. Just play the original Avernum 2 - you can still get it on GOG in a package called Avernum: The Complete Saga."
337880,One Late Night: Deadline,"Warning: Spoilers Ahead!  Hello. First, I would like to point out that I originally gave this game a positive review because I thought several graphical issues like low FPS would be fixed in update 1.1. However, this does not appear to be the case. While many things were changed in update 1.1, there are still several issues with this, like being able to fix the vending machine BEFORE you find the phone (which, there is no objective as far as I know to getting the phone before you go to the room in which it is in, so it is already hard to find), which completely messes up the storyline and what the heck you are doing. Also, I am almost certain I save in a certain spot, and it takes me all the way back to where you first get coffee on the third floor. (Though I could be wrong.) However, that being said, 1.1 also brought many new elements to the game, like the scary man appearing in new places. However, the lady constantly appears in the office when I try to use the fax machine, which can get annoying. All in all, the game is NOT bad. However, it needs to have several things be fixed and tweaked, along with the graphics issues fixed. Until then, I would wait for this game to be fixed.  This next section only applies to the people who are giving this game lots of hate.  While I am dissapointed with this game in several ways, I am also dissapointed to the way people have reviewed this game. For example, reviews such as: 'Just Nasty!' (Yes, that is a quote.) are offensive to the developer of this game. Yes, while he does need to work on several things on the game, it doesn't give anyone the right to be rude about it. (To be honest, the 'Funny' review function on Steam was a mistake.)"
33790,Elizabeth Find M.D. - Diagnosis Mystery - Season 2,Good seek and find game.  Pros: - Lots of objects to search through. - Lots of puzzles to complete. - Nice selection of puzzles in addition to the seek and finds.  Cons: - A little more story than I would like compared to the amount of game play. - Too much looking for objects you've already looked for.
337930,Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~,"I can't express enough how much I loved this game. I've honestly never felt so moved and emotional by a game before. I fell in love with all of the characters, especially the five main boys. They are all so unique and different from one another, the diversity is quite nice, and I know at least one boy will appeal to you. This game helped me when I was feeling lonely or sad, it cheered me up and put love in my heart and a smile on my face, and it felt like I was there in the game, and I could escape with romantic cute boys for a while~ This game also shouldn't be taken that lightly, yes, it looks like a very cute and romantic VN, and it is, but be careful of some of the bad endings, I swear they are nightmare fuel. some of the bad endings contain violence, and extreme obsession so if you are sensitive to that, I'd recommend you stay away from the bad endings and follow the guide for the good ending. Though just remember the bad endings also contibute to the storyline as well, so you should play every ending possible. To be more specific, the violence and extreme obsession is really only showed in Tei's and Yeon-ho's routes (which were personally my favourite because that's what I enjoy) and the rest are pretty much just adorable. The route for '???' made me cry a waterfall, and I'm not going to say more cause I don't want to spoil anything. I can't express enough how much I recommend this game, it's worth every penny. The game is so well done, the dialogue, the art, the graphics, the voices, it's all amazing. Please please get this game, you will not be disappointed in the slightest ^^"
337940,X-note,"First off, this was my first time ever playing a narrative story like this, and I have to say, I'm glad I chose X-note! It's fascinating, mysterious and cryptic plus beautifully drawn and constructed. I thought this game would bore me easily at first, but within the first few minutes I was pleasantly sucked into this world. To me, it felt as if I was watching an anime, just without voice narrative and more moving pictures. This game has 8 endings and you have to get all 8 to unlock a secret section of the game, which I found cool. This game is amazing and I highly recommend you give it a shot, lets see if you to find the secret behind the School ^_^!!"

337970,Wildlife Park - Wild Creatures,This the worst out of all the wildlife games.If you play this please tell me how to place animals.But i do not recommend this game.
337980,Vagrant Hearts,Glitchy garbage. Typos everywhere. Boring combat where every boss is a damage sponge boss where the % times it uses full party attacks determines it's difficulty. Flat characters. Did they use a lame game making program to do this? They shouldn't be allowed to publish cheap game maker crap on Steam. Learn a real programming language and then come back.
3380,Dynomite! Deluxe,"Tried to play - got blank screen but sound O/K.  I am running Win7Pro and the display drivers+DirectX are current. There does not seem to be a way to notify Steam that there is a problem No amount of searching provides an answer. Very, very disappointed It is IMPOSSIBLE to send Steam an email about the problem as their WEB site does not provide that ability I had to wait 10 minutes with a blank screen before I could post this review"
338000,Echoes+,"I just got a hold of this, and MAN this is such an amazing rebuild of the original Echoes, a classic, reimagined, like Pac-Man CE to Pac-Man. Except Echoes+ cranks it up to DX+! Slick game and OST with easy controls and lots of options. Absolutely recommended!"
338030,Mission Control: NanoMech, Early Access Review
338040,Bears Can't Drift!?,Great Game for a coach casual gaming day in the snowy winter
338050,Anoxemia,"No checkpoints, very floaty / wonky controls, and the guy never follows you properly. Supposed to be narrative heavy, but I made it 7 levels in and I never felt intrigued enough by it to push past the gameplay."
338060,Mahjong Pretty Girls Battle,Not bad. In need of more content
338070,ルナティックドーン レジェンドパック,"Not a bad series for the time the games were made! Nowadays with games being real linear, this particular series allows you to do and go where ever you want to. Definately worth a try!"
338110,Khaba,"Found the controls slightly finicky. Apart from that, pretty decent overall."
338120,Marble Duel,"I like it, it's like zuma (I love all those type of marble popping games) but you combat an enemy as well which is an interesting twist. Good graphcis, lots of powerups etc. Recommended if you like this sort of thing."
338130,Strategy & Tactics: Wargame Collection,This game is very fun to play. Best war game i play in a while
338140,Venetica,"Controls poorly and stiffly. Animation is pretty bad and stilted in parts, and the VO is quite awful. It's also riddled with bugs and the sound mixing is atrocious - another game that suffers from LOUD EVERYTHING (quiet voices).  Very disappointed - I love the premise and graphically it's decent (though not great even accounting for its age), but everything is just so awkward and stilted. I could barely get more than 20 minutes in before I just had to turn it off.  Feels like playing a budget RPG from 2002. Was hoping for something at least a bit more polished..."
338170,Ratz Instagib 2.0,"If you are looking for a game which requires skill and precision to be able to compete with the best... look elsewhere. Ratz Instagib is a game with wildly inconsistent netcode, some of the sloppiest feeling movement mechanics, and is really difficult to call an arena first-person shooter. This feels more along the lines of Toon Town Remastered, than Quake Instagib."
338180,Batla,i dont really like it because it doesnt let you plsy online when you hit play it sends you by your self and trust me that makes it pretty boring.
338190,Just Get Through,Love this game i you love some dungeon crawler that progress to be hard as super meat boy than play this!!!!!
338260,Usagi Yojimbo: Way of the Ronin,"Clearly this probably one of the most shortest games I ever played and is that a bad thing? Not really especially if I can do it in one sitting. If you're a comic book lover, you'll like Usagi Yojimbo, or if you're into something really quick..you'll like it all the more. It has NO achievements so truly, it's nothing more than a score attack game with a good story following. I'm hoping they do make a sequel with a bit more of a challenge since this game was good but could use a bit more of a challenge, combat wise at least. Considering how cheap this game, just try for yourself. You might like it..or not, but it worth something if you need a break from long games."
338300,Chicken Little Ace in Action,"3rd person shooter. You also can fly and run a tank. Music is nice. Cutscenes are nice (but low resolution and not fuillscreen - neither is the game itself). Controls are good, few glitches, no bugs.   An enjoyable 7 hour experience which is not that hard and has a quite linearly (not completely) increasing difficulty curve.   If it´s on sale: WTB - Worth To Buy"
338310,Warden: Melody of the Undergrowth,Good story but THE BOSSES ARE TO HARD AND NO FAIR   unless you like the Type of game where you can'y win against a Big boss (the 1 crystal boss) then this is your game  it also feels to basic like the tried to make a game that combines like zelda and a few others together in a bad and dull version
338320,Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic,"I've completed the game, which speaks to its entertainment value and especially humor, but the aspect of the game which is difficult is mostly artificial.   The hardest thing to deal with in the game are debuffs, and each area is themed around most encounters having certain debuffs. The game become trivial once you understand what the debuffs are,   this means replaying the same areas but with harder enemies in act 2 and 3 is a complete chore  .   The most exciting parts of the game happen in newly explored areas where you don't know the incoming challenge and have to pray for the best, like when my druid was forced to drop his weapon and punch a rock golem to death because my other party members killed each other with spells in confusion. The game does have its shining moments, usually of comedic nature.  Buy it if you think you'd like the old-school humor and expect 6 hours before you get bored, skip if you're looking for actual RPG combat."
338330,Super Treasure Arena, Early Access Review
338340,Nightbanes,"Particularly hard story mode hahaha perhaps a bit hasty to start this review but It's true.I bet if you spent some amount of money rule and rhythm will change,or where the game does not apply the same rule when it comes to dominance of any kind so my thoughs are mixed.Give the game a chance and see how it will work for you,will you enjoy or on the contrary you  will be in hard pain all the time hahaha. 6/10"
338390,The Technomancer,"I'm actually going to change this to negitive, because this could have been a great game, but the last patch was just a month after release, then it seems the game has been abandoned, even though there are still a lot of bugs"
338400,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,"5 out of 10 cheap cash in to beat the movie release. the movie will be far better &amp; thats only $15 if youre watching it in 3d. it does have a v sync option so thats nice (take notes thps hd, bully, san andreas 'remaster' etc). it runs decent at 4k if you turn everything on low lol. i feel like my punches dont pack alot of punch. at the end of the day dont expect much from this."
338420,Alum,Pros: It's different for a point and clicker. It has a good soundtrack. Interesting Christian story line.  Cons: I'm a Mac user and can't get achievments for this game unless I am using Windows (which is not an option for me.) I'm an achievement hunter so this disappointed me. I would return the game if I had the chance. 2 hours of my life I'm not getting back.
338540,Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean,"DO NOT play this game if you are not willing write down the passorwd and username for it, if you lose it you are screwed as their support is awful and has no clue how to recover steam-based accounts. I lost mine, and have tried time and again to get them to search their servers for my account info, they keep telling me their is no account associated with my steam account, which is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, as i made such an account as i have indeed played this game. because of their terrible customer support, i will never be able to play this rather fun game ever again. Although i like the game, i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone due to the game devs terrible account recovery capabilities.       P.S.; If a dev happens accross this review, I beg you contact me through steam and help me recover my account."
338550,Terra Lander Remastered,"Recommended on sale.   This needs a map editor / workshop for people to contribute better level designs. (or else the dev. needs to improve it.)   As-is (late 2016), it's worth maybe $2 on sale. But if there was more selection of good level designs it could be worth the full $6 price (and I'd update my review). Until the level availability is improved just play the demo or get it on sale.   It starts out good, but then very suddenly gets very annoyingly way too hard, too soon. not a smooth progression. the fun just slams to a sudden halt rather than gradually becoming more challenging. Unfortunately the lack of progression can't be seen in the Demo.   The first few levels are quite easy and fast (once you get used to the basic control) and you'll get through them in maybe 2 attempts. Then at Level 6, 'Gauntlet of the Gods' it abruptly gets more than 10x harder and you'll burn up an hour repeating the same level over and over. Then it's time to uninstall because the repetition of getting farther through it inch by inch on each replay is too grindy, and be glad you only spent $2 for a 6 level game.   There should be a gradual increase in interesting challenges of fuel management, navigation, and shooting.   It's basically a remake of some of the earliest oldschool moon landers, but with shooting added, and other embellishments, which does make it more interesting &amp; fun.   The voice is simply annoying and repetitive, not actually amusing. But you can turn the volume way down. The music works well with it.  "
338630,Wildlife Camp,"This is an awesome game! When I first opened the game, I thought it would only be about healing animals. Which, most games like this are. But no, you get to care for the animals (feeding, watering, petting, grooming, and cleaning hooves if applicable) and you also have to train them! Once you trained them all the tricks possible (you have to unlock them all, first) you can release them to either the Savannah, the Songutu Forest, or the Kingo Swamp based on where the animal lives. I recently found out that you can name the animals and even dress them up or give them 'haircuts'. Wildlife Camp is more in depth than I thought it would be. I'd give it a 10/10! I totally recommend this, the game is way underpriced and it should be worth about $20! If you love animals and/or you would love to be a veterinarian and an animal caretaker, Wildlife Camp won't disappoint you!"
338710,Urja,You are a pawn and need to work your way up the hierarchy in order to vanquish your foes and be the last piece standing.  -Pros- *Deeper than it initially feels *Feels like very few games i have personally played *Great idea and very clean execution  -Cons- *No real story or solid explination for the what or the why without digging a bit *The game is set up in a way that you can feel 'thrown to the wolves'  *Perhaps for what you get the asking price might be a bit much  Interesting 7/10
338760,Death Ray Manta,"Really pretty visuals and tight controls, and a catchy theme tune. Would maybe have prefered if the early levels weren't the same (at least I think they are), as it can get a little repetitive after a while. However, this game was clearly meant to be played in short bursts (imo). Overall a great deal for the absurdly low asking price."
338800,Seven Kingdoms 2 HD,"Loved the original. This HD version though has several technical issues. It crashes on Alt-Tab and if played in a window, there is about a 50:50 chance that the game will not respond (and ultimately crash) at the beginning or end of a mission."
338810,Demise of Nations, Early Access Review
338830,Star Nomad,"I know this was only a cheap game made by a single person developer.....  But so is 'Endless Sky'...... technically simplistic but works well, bug free, and is also TOTALLY FREE. So is 'Vega Strike'...... rough around the edges, but tons of mods, great community, loads of ships/weapons/upgrades, a realistic game universe that DOES feel like real space (unlike Star Nomad's tiny sectors)..... oh and it's TOTALLY FREE. So is 'Transcendence'..... TONS of ships/weapons/mods, almost infinite variety to be had, great gameplay, and is also TOTALLY FREE (though there is a purely optional pay-for premium version)  And all of the above, despite being free, offer a lot more content than Star Nomad!  Still, it manages to be more promising than the Jesus awful 'Drifter' - at just one fifth of it's £10 price.  And I do still recommend it (now that my problem with not being able to buy a new ship has been sorted :D), don't get me wrong I don't hate the game. Just that the gameplay feels a little simplistic (with can be a + or a - depending on your view), mind you a lot of other games of this genre also feel simplistic. The game galaxy is small, the systems themselves are tiny, tiny, tiny little 'sectors' like in the original 'X-Tension'. There's not that many ships, weapons, upgrades etc..... but the artwork is very well drawn, the developer is very talented at drawing - especially drawing cute girls!!!!! :D &lt;--------- That's sold the game to you hasn't it?"
338890,Harold, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDUynCrQsg 
338960,Rescue Team 1,"The first in a series of time and resource management games, Rescue Team 1 lacks a little functionality compared to the sequels, the biggest one being that you can't queue jobs. Each job requires one worker (on rare occasions, more than one) and the worker needs to be in base before they can be assigned. This leads to button mashing to assign the worker as soon as they return, and when you have multiple jobs and multiple workers, the click fest makes the game a little more frantic than later entries in the series. That said, having recently beaten Rescue Team 5, it was nice to go back to the original title and see how the games have progressed. Despite showing it's age a little, the graphics, sound, and level design in Rescue Team 1 are all still strong. The game still held my attention long enough to gold all levels, and even though the later games are more polished, if you are a fan of the genre, it's still worth checking out."
338980,MOAI: Build Your Dream,"Not sure what the deal is as the overall reviews seem positive, but this game was completely and irredeemably broken for me, and judging by the forums I'm not the only one.   Bugs such as enemies not appearing make certain levels impossible to beat. If only I hadn't sat on it in my backlog for over a year I'd be getting a refund on this one. What a shame."
3390,Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown Deluxe,The nostalgia is real. 5/5 Starfish.
33900,Arma 2,"Deeply involved military sim game. New things I haven't seen: Ability to switch between 1st and 3rd person (actually useful), bullet physics in every gun (and they change between guns too), injury affects aiming accuracy and stance (I got shot in the legs, lost the ability to walk...), realistic vehicles (tank can't be operated by just one person, realistic helicopter physics, can land all flying vehicles...etc.)"
339000,Ukrainian Ninja,"Awesome game, although it's a platformer."
339040,Chicken Little, Pretty good
339110,Plith,"  Terrible game! It loads slowly, it is ugly and even the terrible graphics sometimes can not handle the game. It also crashes, making it impossible to get 100% achievements, because you have to complete the game without ever closing it."
339120,Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike,"A very hard platformer about climbing a big ♥♥♥ mountain.  Fork parkers holiday hike is about a old guy trying to get like money or something for his company. You must then climb to the top of this incredibly tall mountan and collect money, whilist avoiding everything else. Its obviously a 2d platformer, but with a twist, you have this grapple like rope that will be essential for getting to the top of this disasterly mountain. I Would definatly pay Money for this game. Its also got achievments and other cool stuff.  Like flying sweaters."
339130,Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock,"Morningstar is a fairly decent point &amp; click foundation but sadly it has one-dimentional characters and a nonexistent story built on top of it.   I can see why reviews here move the needle more towards the positive end of the spectrum, but what makes or breaks a P&amp;C adventure for me isn't the puzzles or backgrounds, but the story and characters. These are the areas where Morningstar is most lacking. I didn't dislike this game as much as my thumbs down implies, but I did conclude it with a resounding, 'meh.'  Pros:  -Pretty nice backgrounds and occasional animations -Challenging, yet rewarding puzzles -Radio 'hint' system that I was grateful for  Cons: -Weak story. You crash on a planet, you work to get off of it. There's a mystery to the planet, but you won't get to the bottom of it -Incredibly corny and anticlimactic ending -Voice acting varies between 'hammy' and 'phoning it in'"
339160,Tales of the Orient: The Rising Sun,Dones't expect much from a Match 3 game. Just buy it when on sale and you won't regret it.
339190,Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today,"It's an interesting setting for what could be a good adventure game story, but sadly it falls short. It probably varies from person to person, whether or not the things I found to be problematic are bad in their eyes. So I will list them below, so it's easy to make your own decision.  I will keep it spoiler free.  Art style: The art style is great and helps keep it easy to see all interactable items in the world, so you don't have to do the old adventure back-and-forth to make sure you didn't miss anything. It makes you concentrate on the story and the task at hand, which is good. Only a couple of times does the game hide things by making them virtually invisible -- that it is so infrequent makes it extra annoying, because you have no idea where you might have missed something.  All in all, this part is great.   Story: The story starts out with the old 'amnesia' trope (first seconds of the game, so not a spoiler), which is a trope, because it works. As part of the game you try to find out who you are, and at first it seems like this is done in a great way by letting you notice things on your own and piecing things together, but around mid-game it changes and you get force fed exposition in huge lumps. Often this exposition repeats itself by recapping things you learned 5 minutes earlier and at times painfully obvious things were explained to you as if you hadn't been paying any attention to the game up to that point.  It's bad storytelling and really makes the game worse since adventure games rely heavily on the story.  The story itself is ok, though I didn't really like the explanations it used for why things are as they are in the game. Especially the part where the game explains the games titular element feels painfully forced.   Puzzles: The puzzles are for the most part very logical, so you almost never end up doing the inventory shuffle, where you combine everything with everything else. Great. There are even a good array of interesting achievements for fun combinations, which rewards the player for having fun. Double great. On top of that many combinations have semi-unique voice responses from the character and often give a hint to the use of the items, which all in all makes it fun to play around and helps you from being stuck.  Just great work in this department.  There are a couple of times where it makes no sense at all, what you have to combine, but when the rest is done so well, it didn't really bother me too much. Especially since the it was with items you knew you needed to do something to and items you had not yet used -- so the combination will likely be one of the first you try even if it makes no sense.  You can argue that the repeated 'I have used this super useful item, so now I will just throw it away' moments are annoying, but I can understand the need to clear out inventory even if I don't agree on this method.   Choices: Not many adventure games give you any real choices. Some let you solve a puzzle in more than one way, thereby letting you feel a bit like you made a choice. This game does a whole third thing, which is really frustrating and the main reason that I didn't like it.  The story is extremely linear and at times it is directly railroaded.  You almost always only have one thing you need to do next -- one puzzle you have to solve. It may be personal preference whether or not this is something you like, but I don't like that. To me adventure games are better when you can go do other things while you think about how you can solve any specific puzzle. Yes, there are times where you need to do 2-3 things, but they are always linked, so you know that in order to do puzzle A, you know you have to do B which is obviously blocked by C, etc.  In conversations, you get to choose your replies. Or rather, no. You are presented with a list of things to say and often you are forced to click them all before you are allowed to stop talking to the person. This is very annoying especially since a lot of the lines are things you know are directly stupid things to say. But the game forces your hand.  Where the game directly railroads you is by again and again forcing your character to do some of the absolutely dumbest things you can think of. Either by you ending a conversation without revealing sensitive information to someone who absolutely shouldn't know it and then taking control of you character as you are about to leave. You character then returns to the conversation, reveals the information and only then are you allowed to leave. Forced and infuriating. Happens again and again and each time it just feels like you might as well just be watching a badly written movie because you really have no choice and the things the game forces you to do are so dumb that only lazy story writers use these elements to force the story to move on.  At the end I hated the game for doing this.   Voice acting: Voice acting varies a lot. The main character does a good job with the material he has been given and it helps the game a lot. But many of the side characters -- especially the children -- are horrible actors. Don't get me wrong, there are also some good voice actors for the side characters, but the bad ones really are so bad, that it breaks the immersion. The kind that sound like they are just monotonically reading the lines.   Ending: The game is super short.  The second you get to the point where you think the 'real' game is about to begin, it ends abruptly. All up to that point feels a bit like you just getting to know the world and why you are integral to the story. I can only speculate, but it feels like they just didn't finish the game.   TL;DR: A potentially good game marred by a lacklustre story force fed to you by a game that enjoys taking control of your character in order to make sure the story continues no matter how dumb the way it does so is. It is frustrating, because you can see the potential it has and that a lot of care has gone into the many other aspects of the game."

339640,Jagged Alliance Online: Reloaded,"I got this pretty cheap on a promotion and it's a fun jagged alliance game, but it lacks depth and you can notice it's f2p roots. Worth getting on promotion if you are a JA fan but don't expect too much."
339690,Paperbound,"Fun game, but with a few flaws.   I'll start with the good:   The premise is amazing, The game play is frenetic and fun and the game modes have enough varience to make them interesting. Nice selection of characters, though unfortunately due to the nature of the game they are all essentially the same.but they are at least fun to look at and the whole design aesthetic of the game is fantastic.  Now for the bad:    My biggest ishue is with the 'Classic Versus' game mode. The theory behind it, reaching a set score limit and then escaping works in theory, but the problem is that these matches can last for an infinite amount of time due to the fact that if you are killed, the portal goes away. This is particularly problematic when playing with a partner as both members must reach the goal together. This is tricky enough, especially when playing the campaign mode in single-player, but it is compounded on certain stages. For example, the Grinder, a stage from Dante's Inferno, ok, awesome idea.. touching the walls means death and moving platforms all over.. cool... but when you ad in AI to the mix, well my opponents were at a score of -81 when I finally had enough. My team was able to reach the frag limit several times, but given that it takes a few seconds for the tear to open up, and that my partner was getting killed or killing me the moment it appeared, victory, while possible, seemed very unlikely unless I played for a very long time.  My other major gripe is that campaign mode does not posess a save feature of any sort for progress. You could argue that other, similer games do not use this and are successful, but with the nature of gameplay (particularly the flaws in the above game-mode) being unable to stop and return to the book where you left off seems like a major problem.  In conclusion, this is a fun little game. I enjoyed playing it despite the frustrations, but it would be a LOT better if these issues were dealt with."

339840,The Moment of Silence,"I played this game years ago and the story had always stuck with me. When it went on sale, I made sure to buy a copy. The story is positively riveting and predicted the NSA scandal and surveillance drones 10 years before their occurrence. This alone makes the other predictions of the game to be even more interesting/ominous.   I know a game's story is powerfully interesting when my husband takes off his headphones from playing Overwatch to listen to what I'm playing ;)  I really appreciate the sheer number of locations and scenes in The Moment of Silence offers. All too often point and click adventure games these days keep to just 3 locations with just a few different points of view. The Moment of Silence keeps you on your toes with a huge variety of locals.  I have to say the character movement can be a bit clunky at times. Also, sometimes I had to click on obscure points in order to fully explore an area. While I felt like the majority of the puzzles were orangic and intuitive, there were a good handful that weren't so and were confusing.  Overall, if you love a good Sci-Fi story, enough locations to really feel like an adventure, and don't mind keeping a walkthrough handy, The Moment of Silence is a game I would recommend you purchase. If it's on sale for $10 or less, definitely snatch it up!"
339850,Overclocked: A History of Violence,"Im going to be honest : I never managed to even beat the game to find out the ending.  A couple of things to know here :    -Terrible voice acting. Id say its pretty damn hard to feel the characters when dialogues sound as half-♥♥♥♥♥ as they do.I understand they might not have had the budget to hire better qualified actors but the ones they had certainly could do a better job.That combined with how poorly they are scripted and boring leaves a very poor impression right from the start of the game (and it gets worse as it progresses)   -Soundtrack.Or id say almost complete lack of it.You get some ambient sounds now and then and a mildly tense music playing in tense scenes but thats it.You might as well put on a music yourself.I ♥♥♥♥ing fell asleep an hour and half into the game,what is this ♥♥♥♥?   -Choppy animations.You can look past the average graphics in adventure games (i sure can) but poor character animations can ruin all your attempts in immresion.If you have to play this game i strongly reccomend using a walkthrough because the time it will take you to just run around and exhaust every option will take a huge amount of time : be it calling someone on the phone and waiting 15 to 20 sexonds to realise nobodys going to answer or unreasonable framerate drops in dialogues.  Im not going to outline the pros or cons of the plot because it wouldnt be fair since i havent beaten the game but you might get by now what my thoughts on that are. "
339860,AoF World Online,"  TL;DR Anti-player game turned into a grindfest. basically you grind the last boss you can easily beat until you get enough mission points to unlock the next area except it takes like 2minutes to run to the boss everytime!   First off,"
33990,AlternativA,"Give this one a go if you're into cyberpunk stuff. There's hardly any action but that shouldn't stop a game for being enjoyable, now should it? Hacking was fun, going to the same places several times a bit less. Conclusion: see my first sentence. :)"

340000,Headlander,"Headlander is a metroid style game with 70's atari box cover inspired art and Double Fine sensibilities. It's sadly lacking in alot of departments.   I'd been looking froward to this as I'd loved the designers previous game Stacking. Sadly while the art is Spectacular, it's Story and mechanics dont quite fit togther in a lot of places.   I've done everything in the game and I still dont understand the story. There was one person talking to me and another who was against me talking to the public. I have no Idea why. I was searching for   the resistance  . No idea why. They wanted my help getting   their boddies   back, That I understood. Come the end of the game the missing   boddies arent found, or explained   I'm a   clone  , I've no idea why. Erl   killed himself, saving me?   I have no idea why. The bad guy was genericly bad because he was controlling people. But breaking that controll makes no difrence to anyone. The world isint changed beyond some of the red gaurds forming a band.   I think playing for three hours and finding that the auto save has failed would be the first of my complaints on the mechanichal front. My first time doing the archives puzzle I managed to glitch my way through it without doing one of the locks. Boosting can put you in spaces you cant leave ocasionally. Requireing a restart. You have to be very carefull with your shield as the origin point for lazers can falll inside the shield rendering it useless.   What confuses me most is that double fine has no audio priority. Enviroment Barks keep interupting conversations your having. They have multiple voice actors read out the eact same lines.. which confounds me. For a company so much about their writing I'm just shocked at that.  The collectibles are numerous, too mumerious to feel any imediate value to moving forward as you have to buy things from a skill tree instead of being rewarded with weapons in a Metroid style. Alot of the deeper tactics never became usefull as the controlls to activate them were too complex to remember and they werent as usefull as just spaming the fire button.  It's got some fun concepts in there that you just wish were explored in a deeper fashon. Humanity without boddies, space exploration, expamsion of humanity out of earth. But the art seems to impily more then the story ever delivers.   Mostly I wish I understood what the hell was happening. I enjoyed parts. I played it to the end, but I cant really reccomend it based on wether it fulfils the potential it's trying to advertise."
340030,Dungeon of Gain,"It's a bad game, it seems to freeze a lot, doesn't seem like a finished project."
340050,Survivalist,"This game costs only £4, but it contains hours of fun for those who want to enjoy a zombie apocolypse game where you build your own community.  I adore this game. The choices you make can define how your gameplay is, such as: Should I recruit this group of five to my community? They could be used for guarding, farming or constructing buildings, but they also need to be fed which can drain my supplies and risk my other survivors' lives if they venture out to get more food for them.  I am very impressed by this game, considering that it costs such a small price is a big surprise for the quality of it. I wish we could see more games like these more and State of Decay. I adore a game where you build a community during an apocolypse or other circumstances.   The only cons I would say about this game is that the camera angle and this 'fog of war' that limits your visibility to such a small sight, by the time you've seen a group of infected and raised your gun, they're already on top of you and infecting you. I have had this happen quite often, which is an annoyance. The other con would be the unecessarily fast zombies in this game, there is nothing that has annoyed me more than having one of my runners ambushed by a group of infected and then constantly caught by them when they try to outrun them, eventually they either get caught and bitten due to the poor fatigue that takes a long time to improve or they waste all their ammo on shooting them whilst moving, which is irritating due to the poor accuracy when moving even when a survivor is right in front of them.  Overall, there are improvements to be made, but this game at the current moment is great in my opinion."
340070,Battle Ranch,"Pros:  -Authentic artwork and not stolen/bought assets. (Give credit where credit is due)   Unfortunately that's as far as I got because:  Cons: -SLOWEST GAMEPLAY I'VE EVER SEEN. It's not laggy or anything, it's just set 400% slower than a defence game should be. -Music is 10 second loops, and it never seems to change. Ever. -Mini-games last WAY TOO LONG. -Low res menu.  Do I recommend it? No. Do I think people should condemn it for being a pvz ripoff? Not a chance, you knew what ytou were in for when you bought a $1 game."
34010,Alpha Protocol,"Mechanically awful. Riddled with bugs. And yet, one of the greatest RPGs of all time, with a refreshing setting - it's nice to play an RPG that avoids both fantasy and sci-fi - and featuring unquestionably the most brilliant dialogue system - both in terms of impact on the narrative and the process of responding - in any game yet made. Frustratingly fantastic."
340120,Crazy Chicken,Nostalgia... Just remembered myself pointing a plastic gun to the TV trying to shoot ducks while my stupid dog runs around... That was prob 15 years ago and i think it shoudl stay in that time. If you have any questions how I gave any rating feel free to comment. Please keep in mind that this is my personal preferences:  Story: n/a Gameplay: 2 (+2 after seing the huge gun) Voice Acting/Music: 2 Graphics: 4 Depth: n/a Flexibility: n/a Reward System: n/a  Total: 3.3/10
340130,Crazy Chicken - Invasion,"There needs to be a side thumb option, because this game was presented well (though I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it, similar in style to the free apps through googles play store).

340250,Crystal Towers 2,"Excellent game. A true hidden gem. Don't look at the graphisms, I know it's bad, not the worst but still bad. But except that: Good gameplay, Good level design, awesome music, good idea, good length. You can't say that there is a story, but it doesn't really matter.  If you are looking at a retro platformer, it's the game, it has everything:  Level design allowing more than one path like Sonic: Check Redoing a level with new objectives like Mario 64: Check (Plus, a lot of objectives are hard but fast to finish) Secrets: not a lot, but there are there. Collectable and upgrades: Check. A bit of crafting: check  The only con that I find are the graphics and some objectives that are a bit frustrating. Check the demo if you are hesitating. There is 33 level with 7 objectives each + 9 bosses."

340300,Teddy Floppy Ear - Mountain Adventure,"ITS SO BAD. THE CHARACTERS SOUND LIKE THEY HAVE BRONCHITIS AND THE BEAR IS DRUNK. ABD YOU MOVE REALLY SLOWLY. (seriously though, games like this should be available at places like Game or on kid-friendly-and-kid-based consoles, not on Steam itself. I rest my case.)"
340310,Teddy Floppy Ear - Kayaking,"My 5 year old daughter loves this game, and has played through it several times. It is fairly similar to Teddy Floppy Ear - Mountain Adventure, a fairly linear adventure game with some kid friendly mini games throughout. Kids at the older end of the age range will probably find the game less engaging, and since it is fairly short, will probably quickly solve it and move on to something else. For younger kids (4-6), they will definately get more from it. Because of the variety of mini-games, there is a fair amount of replay (once again, especially for the littler kids). One of the best parts of the Teddy Floppy Ears games is the scenery, the voice acting, the whole aesthetic. In this regard, as much as TFE- Kayaking was a good buy, I would recommend TFE- Mountain Adventure over it. We've got all the TFE games now, and of them all, my daughter played Mountain Adventure the most. Potential *BIG* downside, not mentioned in my TFE- Mountain Adventure review, your kid may tie up your Steam Account, a lot!"
340320,Sinless,"Short experience. Hoped for more. Story is unpolished and not deep enough, especially for a point and click.  If you play it, expect an atmospheric, trippy and short story  As it is too chaotic and superficial I can't recommend it. Let's see what the next episode brings..."

340360,Tomb of Tyrants,Nothing you do really matters. The game is made artifically long by holding content behind a time grind barrier. A lot of the 'choices' seem to make no impact on the game and how well you do really depends on how many unlocks you've grinde out so far. Boring

I tried to start it via Steam VR with the option play on oculus rift and steam started it as a side by side on steam virtual desktop. I've never been more annoyed in my life.

I get it, and have no idea how to play it. Like, really? You have time to make it look all amazing and good, but no tutorial? Not everyone knows what you know, especially when you just make it. I wont give the game a bad review, but try to make a tutorial or something because, I want to play a game where i know what I'm doing."
340490,Subterrain,"So you wake up and everyone is dead or a zombie in the space station. Sounds like you've woken up in a game that is going the have heavy crafting and survival elements. Manage your food, water and sleep while the zombies start hitting the gym and are getting beefier by the hour. On top of that you will also find yourself having to deal with a lack of oxygen, freezing temperatures, and a lack of power running through most locations. Kick back and manage your high tech handy dandy crafting stations and research stations that are gonna be tedious to manage (Hit tier 2 tech as soon as possible to limit frustration). The goal of the game is to escape this fever dream of a management nightmare using a rocket to propel us to greener pastures.  Honestly this game is a bit of a mixed bag of enjoyment with the degree of how tedious it is to manage. Once your reach Central Control I have to say, this is where micromanagement hell begins. Tedious busywork is what it feels like, running back and forth from the nearby facilities to access and use them. Kill me please. Where it does management right is the time aspect of the game. While you rest eat sleep and go about crafting yourself better gear, researching techs. Just remember the zombies are hitting the gym and they're inviting all their cool and hip friends too. Essentially the longer the time you spend in the game just existing, is time the zombies are putting to growing in number and strength. So manage your time wisely or things just might spiral out of control.  There is the usual gather up resources, materials you require to craft all your weapons armor etc. You can also recycle items to acquire more resources as well and I highly recommend doing so in Nilson Engineering. Where you invest your resources can end up being a bit of a quandary. You might need to build and research better reactor modules to not have a generator meltdown, or maybe a better weapon to not die in the first place. Not to mention researching tech requires you to give up your newly produced long knife(as an example) to research a better one. As well as the fact that research and production require a certain amount of the valuable resource called time. So you have to keep in mind how and when to allocate your resources to production and research.   The combat really isn't that great and can get repetitive quickly even with the introduction of new enemy types and stronger versions. I think its mostly the restrictions that are imposed on you that force you to manage multiple factors that keep the game engaging. You need a oxygen, thermal, and power pack to even venture into locations without functioning life support. This pretty much keeps you on your toes and managing your finite life support. Hopefully you don't run out before you can refill or evacuate back to central control for a refill.   I really do enjoy the game despite my problems with the tedium of central control. I find myself highly entertained playing a game where i really have to manage my time and work within the restrictions it imposes on you. Its a constant struggle against the game trying to kick your ♥♥♥♥ in. Definitely worth picking up if you don't mind the beginning's horrendous micromanagement and enjoy the idea of a game where you have to balance your crafting resources, time and the available tech you have.  Oh and this game really has no elements of horror."
340520,Tallowmere,"I was so excited for this game! It is a great idea in theory but 4 things make this game a DON'T BUY:  1) The animation is truly terrible. This is coming from somebody whose first video game system was an Atari 2600! Video game sprites from the 80's had 2 frames of animation for movement. 30 years later, we can offer at least that much! With almost zero animation (but the odd super-cool flame or blood effect), it feels less like a video game and more like a comic book with no dialogue or storyline. It removes a lot of the fun and immersion. Original roguelikes have zero animation as well but they have a lot more depth in their mechanics, which I will get into later.  2) If the animation is not there, at least give me some variety in enemy attacks. Most enemies are just long-range attackers and that makes each run incredibly dependent on weapon drops. The grenade and rocket-launcher are so useful and everything else...not so much. The other weapons each have glaring weaknesses and your game is reduced to spamming grenades and rockets from an extremely far and safe distance. If that is the gameplay, I really don't need monsters and shields and tactics. I can just shoot rockets and grenades into an empty pit and listen to the explosions, right? Shallow mechanics.  3) The dungeons have a random layout, so nothing was designed with playability in mind. This sounds like it will always be fresh but it is often frustrating because you cannot see what you are walking into and you can end up dead in an instant. You can move slowly to avoid trouble but you can easily trigger an impossible situation where your death is nearly guaranteed unless you slaughter all monsters in an instant or make an amazing escape. Of course, this won't happen if you just carpetbomb all open spaces with grenades and rockets.  4) No static unlocks. This is easily the worst part of Tallowmere and it kills the game. Playing a game that starts over from the beginning every time is fine if it is an arcade experience. But arcade experiences do not have random death from procedurally-generated dungeons. Imagine if you put a quarter into an arcade machine and the game randomly just blew up your ship after 2-5 seconds? If you cannot save the game and no levels or gear or stats carry over, you need some sort of progression via learning the game. Even a fighting game that has no saves and random enemy strategies doesn't have random enemy attacks. Chun-Li's kicks will not suddenly do more damage because she is a randomly 'higher-level/big-head' Chun-Li.   TL;DR The challenge is supposed to be random, not the fun."

340650,Elements: Soul of Fire," https://youtu.be/Q3En9MUSipg   It's easy to see that the creator of this game put 100% of their effort into making it. The story is personal, the art is hand done and the music is strong throughout. Despite all the personal effort pour into this game it fails to reach the heights that the creator likely had in mind while working on it.  The story is a slog and assumes the player knows more about the characters and world than they do leaving the initial crisis fall flat when tasked immediately to save the world. The charm of hand drawn art doesn't make up for the rough fidelity that becomes an eyesore before the end of the first act."

340720,The Tiny Tale 2,Good game.   Level designs are good and music is soothing.   Best played in relaxing mode.

340800,Unhack,"This is not a good game. The gameplay itself is simplistic, the UI gives little to no indication of progress, the art is amateurish, and the characters are poorly written and one dimensional.  Also, if I hear the Miss Debug character SAY '*Yawnies*' instead of actually yawning one more time, I'm going to slit my wrists. I get it, she's sleepy. LET IT GO. Quite possibly the most annoying character trait in a videogame since ...no, this wins. Nothing comes close.  It's also very short. I'm not sure if that's a positive or a negative. Not worth the asking price. Hopefully anything else this developer does going forward is significantly better thanks to the practice they got in on what I really hope is their first game."

340880,Solar War,"This game is great, has in-depth micromanagement and strategy, And a great satisfaction when your fleet of starships are conquering alien invaders. Quite Similar to the Master Of Orion games, an intense strategic and management challenge. It has a bit of a learning curve, but is really fun once you learn the mechanics of the game. Definitely worth $20, without a doubt."
340920,Siege of Turtle Enclave,"This game was boring. The enclave design wasn't bad, and the building/resource system worked reasonably well, but the battles were just SOOOO uninteresting. Would have been better to just make combat purely turn-based to let the player move through them at their own pace than bog the whole system down with the attempt at forcing real time controls. Has potential, played an hour or two out of curiousity then deleted it from my system for good."
340960,Pulsen, Early Access Review
340990,Bolt,"For that little while that I plaid this game, it gave me mixed feelings.   While it's true to this port doesn't support 1080p doesn't make it a bad game at all.  Note that this game was made 2008 which if I remember didn't have 1080p anyway. (Correct me if I'm wrong)  Overall the game is enjoyable but like everybody else have said, buy it when its on sale if you liked to movie.   (I bought it about 5€ and for what its worth, I don't regreat buying it.)"
3410,Heavy Weapon Deluxe,"Played this for a few minutes and it's not really what I hoped it would be. I expected a sidescroller with lots of shooting. And oh, it's there alright. But the controls are a ♥♥♥♥♥. And it looks a bit to simple for my taste. So I'll stick with the other sidescrolling shooters/twin-stick shooters, thank you very much.  [Rating: 64/100]"
341000,Mad Games Tycoon,"It's a good game BUT the Devs are so concerned with making players happy they crank out updats almost daily which DESTROY YOUR SAVE GAMES and all of your effort. They need to figure out like other publishers, how not to ♥♥♥♥ off the players. I don't know when this game will be finished but I keep going back to see if it is. It is still hard to play a few hours, walk away, and come back later to find a small patch has vaporized your efforts. Nearly two years on they claim it's finished. It isn't. A new game is a few days away from Greenheart games, the makers of Game Dev T^ycoon. Spend your money on that instead."
341020,Chronicles of Teddy,"-Horrible controls (90% unwanted sliding down walls) - Terrible hitboxes (got hit when enemy touched my sword) -Pathetic character attack range. (well its a toy knife but still... got hit when attacking by the monster i attacked...)   Finishing this game was more of a chore than an accomplishment. SERIOUSLY A PAIN However, -The use of music, in this game is very creative which in my opinion, balances out the bad controls.   ANYWAYS, if you are looking for a game which good gameplay, difficult but fair and, have fun to fight bosses, this is not the game for you."
341030,Colonial Conquest,It's really really hard trying to drag a game which played well in 1985 into the 21st century and expect it to be viable. I didn't find this fun. My memories of the game long ago were far more enjoyable. Maybe it's fun on an IPad or phone but not on a PC.
341060,The Lady,"Game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Tries to be 'brutally difficult' by not giving any checkpoints and causing any death to require a restart of the entire game, but at the same time being more of a puzzle game needing trial and error. Redoing previous levels is tedious and boring once solved as not much goes on and your character is a pain to control.  Music and art are cool but fail to save the game from its annoying design choices. "

341150,Age of Fear 2: The Chaos Lord GOLD,"I don't like obscene nudity. And this game, advertise self with sado-maso chick. I I feel treated like 12 yo kid or 21 yo nerd."
341160,Steam Heroes,"Steam Heroes is a Match 3 puzzle game that unfortunately fails to deliver. It consists of a story mode which, as others have stated, takes ~40 minutes to complete and is pretty meh. The game then proclaims that this was meant to act as a tutorial and that the now unlocked 'Steam Heroes' mode is the real game.. but this is just the ability to choose from the same 12 bosses you just defeated. There is a significant jump in difficulty with these - a decent amount of my play time has been an exercise in frustration trying to defeat Baron Von Smog. Which brings me to my main gripe (aside from the horrendoes controls) and that's the claim that there's more strategy involved in Steam Heroes than other Match 3 games...  The basic idea is that different colour/steam matches will power your different heroes (tank, heals, dps) and also do direct healing or damage. But there isn't a whole lot of time to employ this, especially in Steam Heroes mode, where taking a moment to find a match you want could actually cost you - the most strategy you can really employ, other than furiously matching things that might be detrimental to you depending on the boss, is picking which special is going to serve you best if you happen to trigger one.  So, while you could get a reasonable amount of time out of this game if you wanted, it's really not the most fun you could be having. And really, once you've defeated the bosses twice there's no real incentive to come back. Also, either the ranking doesn't work or I'm the only person to have bothered with Steam Heroes mode. :P  Sadly I feel there is potential here, but it's wasted on sub-standard.. everything. There are better games out there. Glad I got this in a crate,"

341380,Countless Rooms of Death,"This one sadly misses the mark.  Okay 3D graphics and smooth gameplay don't save the game from its limitations.  There's not much to do, you run around a bunch of rooms and look at stuff- the premise wasn't unviable, but the delivery falls flat. It feels very unfinished. Other 'walking simulators' and 3D puzzle games (Anna, Dear Elise) pull the whole atmospheric/puzzle delivery off perfectly - while such games aren't everyones cup of tea, most certainly a bad example of the genre is more like a cup of tea you don't want with petrol in it."

341460,Fallen Temple,What I think about this game.  Fallen Temple Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUn6hXBt8nU 
341470,Loot Hunter,"When I watched the trailer and screen shots on the store page, I thought the Loot Hunter is a pure match-three game and lost interest in it. I was impressed by some other games from the same developer, so I bought their bundle, which also contains the Loot Hunter. After I tried it for several minutes, I found it was not that simlpe in term of game play. The player is set in the boots of a captain living among islands and isles looking like somewhere in the Carribean. You can aquire and complete quests, battle and loot other ships, find buried treasures, buy and sell goods, and upgrade your ship to better models and equip it with looted items, and the match-three game exists only in the naval battle. The first 2-3 hours were exciting and enjoyable. However, after that the game become old very quickly, since there are only a handful kinds of missions, the profits from trading becomes very neglectable, and the battle are also relatively repititive (the system itself is okay, but you have to do it again and again uncountable times, especially in late time where you have almost nothing else to do).  So in summary, this game feels like a simplified version of Sid Meire's Pirates. Only recommended when you think the current price of Loot Hunter is worth a two-hour-long game life."

341540,TRIP Steam Edition,A bunch of leftover Unity test projects selling for 5 bucks? What a trip!
341550,Super Cyborg,"This is a good game, so I feel bad for giving it a bad review, but as of now I can't recommend buying this game. It's a fun game for people who want to go back in time and play some nostalgia-inducing games, but I have some problems with Super Cyborg.  So the most annoying thing I found in the game is the times you have to jump on platforms. There's something about the jumping in the game that just makes it feel awkward about jumping through platforms, but that isn't my problem. The problem is that if you fall from the platforms, you lose a HP. The reasoning is that the POV isn't locked on your character, but is locked on the section of the level you're at, so if you're at a small platform-jumping section and fall beyond the screen border, you're gonna lose a HP. The bad thing about losing HP in this game is that you only 4 HP and you don't want to lose it in such a simple and stupid way.  Another thing I didn't like is that you can't restart a level. You have to manually lose all 4 HP and then let it restart, which I don't understand. Why wouldn't there be a 'Restart' button?  The music's alright, the controls are fine, but your character feels too slow. The difficulty option is completely useless. Even if you pick 'Easy,' it's not gonna be easy in any way.  In all honesty, I'd recommend just buying something else."
341640,Relativity Wars - A Science Space RTS,"Ehh. Nothing really interesting. A game from the 80s with some graphics updates. Sure, I guess it uses some basic relativistic equations (Lorentz transform seems to be used) but the game mechanic doesn't really have much to do with relativity at all. It's just shooting ♥♥♥♥ in space and building things."

341680,stratO,"Great game to waste time on, isn't worth 9.99 full but as a part of a bundle? Amazing."
341700,Cahors Sunset,"A game that feeds you story day by day. It goes from story segment to stat-raising decision to random stat-changing event and then repeats as long as you keep your stats high enough to live another day. You celebrate every birthday by losing stats and getting closer to death.  The story was pretty interesting but depressing. From as far as I got in my playthroughs, it's a depressing story that highlights the bad things that happen when you live long enough to experience them.  The gameplay was disappointing to me because the choices were only about the stats.  In my first playthrough I hoped that the choices mattered beyond juggling stats. I picked choices that felt good to me (stats were important but I also factored in how I felt about the actual action). But eventually it felt like the options were randomly generated and didn't affect anything beyond the stat gains/losses. There were times when two options had the same stat changes but the action was seeing a different movie/show. I hoped that meant there was something special about the choice but I never saw the difference. Nothing special happens if you skip your meds, smoke or quit, pay back debts, or keep in touch with family. If I recall correctly, at another time I got the option to sell my old car which I declined, then two months later bought a new car, and then again, two months later I bought another new car. That was silly enough to break my immersion.  I got to the 'end game' in my second playthrough by ignoring the action flavor text and picking choices that had the best overall net gains (there are choices that give you a net loss) and prioritizing stats that were getting low.  Maybe worth a try if you want to see a depressing story. The gameplay itself is just filler that limits how much story you can see."

341720,Among Ripples,A simple but tough game where you attempt to run an ecosystem without everything dying. The catch: The pond is very small so every small change can have a big impact.
341730,Dustoff Heli Rescue,"This has to be one of the best games I've ever played. Its simplistic graphics keep kids detached enough that it can be fun without being traumatizing. It certainly isn't an easy task doing what is required of these pilots. It might not be AAA quality, but its story and history make up for that. Again, well done."
341750,A.V.,"It is a very, I mena VERY complex game. I can only recommend it for people that LOVE puzzule games, and are REALLY good at them. Honestly this is the only game that I would say that you have to be prepaired to want your money back. It can very easly confuse you to a point in which you can't do anything. If yu buy it, be prepared to want a refund very early in the game. So sadly I can't really recommend this game."
341760,Flem,"Classic platformer with retro style graphics and an ''interesting'' protagonist. The game itself poses a nice challange with good music to go along. There are a few annoying moments where you die to see where you need to go or projectile spawning off the screen and falling on you. Overall it's a decent experience, however there are other games that are simply more memorable/better."

341820,Plush,A puzzle games where you need to match the plushs to make them happy. Fun at first but feels repetitive at last. Always the same order to complete all the levels. These plushs need to learn some social skills.
341870,Tembo The Badass Elephant,Tembo the badass elephant is a game with a beatiful art style and pretty cool levels. So why did I use the Steam refund feature? Because controlling the character with a controller (Xbox One Controller) is total unplayable mess. I died about 20 to 30 times in each level because Tembo just started to dash himself into death WITHOUT any input by myself. I also couldn't change the control settings because it just always changed to 'Joystick Button 6' (My controller works perfectly fine in Rocket League and DmC) So I would only recommend this game if you don't want to play with controller.
34190,Sonic and SEGA All Stars Racing,"So here we go! Sonic and Sega all stars racing (or SSSR for short) is a Mario Kart clone, but actually, funner. Why? BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BLUE SHELLS! HALLELUJAH! But really, this is a fun game! When you start, you can test drive with Sonic and get used to the controls and items. I played Transformed, which was fun, but had issues like having rare items TOO rare, the AI getting to BS levels of hard, and the items not being very SEGA themed. I like this game more because from what I played as of 1/2/2017, those issues aren't there. The controls feel fantastic. Fun fact: Mario was going to be in this game as a Wii exclusive, but was removed because of the Olympic crossovers. Really, why can't we have a real crossover, why Olympics? But this game has flaws still. After all, what game does not have flaws? The character lineup is kinda lame. They have those LEGO like guys from that one genesis game, but no Tojam and Earl. (They were cut). And most insulting to me, Cream is not in this game! WHAT! They have Big the Cat (aka Meme the Cat)! Seriously SEGA! But then again, they have not fixed this issue in transformed, even if transformed has AGES. Nothing a 3rd game can't fix. You can get this game dirt cheap on steam, but some copies of the XBOX360 version have Banjo and Kazooie in the game, and labeled, so take a pick!"
341910,Ultimate Space Commando,"Remember the Space Crusade game for DOS and Amiga in the 90's? This is as close as we are going to get to a new one of those. Basically the same kind of turn based strategy game with some more RPG stats thrown in.  Graphics are simplistic, not a good looking game, and the interface is confusing at first; but it is a very tense and challenging game."

341960,DP Animation Maker,"When it comes to adding animation, yes this is good. When you add images of your own so you can animate with snow and others, it is bad, because you can not orient the image to your liking. You cannot rotate the image except to resize it. This is poor in image handling.  Since I prefer adding my images and to add animation, because I cannot rotate the images, I will give this as poor performance. "
3420,Iggle Pop! Deluxe,"Weeeell, I don't really recommend this game. It has aged, but not exactly gracefully. It's not horrible either. But it just isn't really good either.  For 5€, it's too little. I bought it in the Popcap Bundle, so it was alright, I guess?   Still, for demanding 5€ and then giving you relatively monotonous gameplay... it's too much money. It's just too much for so little actually happening. That's why I wouldn't recommend buying this game.  Oh, and just for the sake of completion: You play as one of four heroes to save the Iggles, a race of furry little creatures color-coded and caught in bubbles by some kind of evil force. Yeah. That's the sum of it. You move through a little labyrinth, collect the Iggles, avoid the baddies, and send the Iggles home with the approrpiate home fields.  And... that's it. For 101 levels in Adventure mode. Yay."
342020,BiT Evolution,The only thing redeemable about this game is the title theme... but the title theme is SO GOOD I almost gave the game a positive review. Seriously listen to the song below.    https://soundcloud.com/major-games/sets/bit-evolution

I really like the meaning behind the game overall. Hiding from the monsters that might eat you alive, all while trying to avoid your sharp bladed thoughts in the shadows.

342180,Arizona Sunshine,"Best vr game i've played! very good! boop! sorry fred, there goes the top of your head!"
342200,MechWarrior Online,"I love this game. MWO is set in the battletech universe, in which a number of factions of different ideas and heritages fight among themselves for the control of the Universe. The leading war machines of this futuristic conflict are Mechs, a sort of ultra-giant heavy armoured and armed robots, piloted only by the bravest and noblest warriors of each faction. In this game you'll have to impersonate one of these pilots and manage your Mech, from its loadout configuration to the actual piloting in the battlefield. Let me be clear: the game requires some time to master its mechanics, so if you're new expect some confusion and frustration in the firsts matches. But the great number of options and different play styles you can choose it's exactly what makes this game unique and deeper, and hence better, once you'll start to learn the mechanics. A very positive factor, beside the game itself, it's the affectionate fanbase, which is almost always very gentle and will help you whenever you ask (I found metamechs and mechspecs web sites particularly useful). I spent a lot of time (and no money, this is definitely not a play to win game) on it, and I plan to continue. If you're in structured simulation games this is worth giving a shot!"
342230,Air Guardians,"Bad controlls, the map is usless while trying to find your targets. Like it suppsoet to be in front of you but you dont see it while there is a red dot on the damn radar right in front of you. also the radar is 2D, no way to know if the target is above or below you. The 'plot' is not really a plot (you start a normal patrol, a sec later you are beeing haild by unknown force, when things start to heat up while both you and the other force trying to figure out what to do, you loose communication, so what the first thing you do? thats right, you are ordered to kill them all). there are no physics in the game, up or down, its all the same, no air drag, no lift speed reduction, no dive attacking. voice act is horrible!  2\10, a cheap game to get for your 8 y/o if you want him to get bored after a day at best..."
342240,SCHAR: Blue Shield Alliance,"This game is awful. Poor controls, lousy interface."
342250,Aspectus: Rinascimento Chronicles,"I bought it to see if the card drops were still available and I was glad to see they still are. (1 Every Hour Though...)  My ultimate goal is to craft the noose emoticon which so far has been a failure...  Game is alright, though I really bought it for the steam items. :P"
342260,Nevermind,"I really wanted to like this game. The unique heart rate integration makes it something unlike anything else. Even the story is something I haven't seen in any other game. It fell short in several aspects, though.  First, many of the puzzles are... not difficult necessarily... just unclear. They don't give you any clue as to what they want you to do. On one of the later levels, I was so lost I had to consult the Internet, but found absolutely nothing (maybe that level was a new recent addition, so playthroughs and walkthroughs weren't out there yet?).  Second, it just wasn't nearly as frightening as I expected. After the first two levels, I understood the nature of the game and what to expect. At that point, I had no problem at all keeping my heart rate under control, and I'm someone who usually chickens out of horror games. Maybe the developers thought they couldn't make it too scary or players' heart rates would get uncontrollable and the game would be unplayable. Although a valid concern, I do not think this justifies the predictable nature and lack of very frightening elements.  Maybe on a sale for $5 (as when I bought it), it's worth the purchase. For $20, I don't really see it living up to what it claims to possess. It does have some good things going, but it needs to be smoothed out and given some levels with good horror content. Until then, don't buy it unless it's on sale."
342280,Manyland,"This game is amazing!! Wiether you like sandbox games, space games, multiplayer games, or any other genre, Manyland has you covered.

342300,Zombie Kill of the Week - Reborn,"2D shooter with a great sense of humour. Even if you are sick of zombie games, this one is fun by yourself or with others."
342350,Into The Gloom,"The pixel horror game 'Into The Gloom' drops you in a mysterious circumstance filled with questions of what is going on. Why is everyone dead around you? What caused everyone to hang themselves? Why are you here? Using pixelated graphics can often be seen as a drawback. What can pixels do that realistic graphics can't? Into The Gloom uses them effectively, with everything being very detailed and adds more of a disturbing touch to the enemies and the hanging bodies. This also allows the horror to come from other places, such as the soundtrack, the element of mystery, and the overarching story that reveals more with each ending. Jumpscares are scarce, never overstaying their welcome, with the main enemy of their respected section causing panic. Into The Gloom does well during first playthroughs with each branching path. With each death, the player gains more information on how to survive till the end. The puzzles are difficult, but not too difficult that the player would get frusturated as it does show progression. Each ending branches off from each other, giving something new for the progression and the different choice the player made. The game also comes with a way to unlock notes about the background of entities and people to encourage players to do and find ways to unlock them. Coupled with background music with eack new area and different sounds accompaning each enemy, Into The Gloom does not overstay its welcome. The only problem is that it is easy to get caught on corners, and while you are being chased this can be a temperary annoyance.  Overall, Into The Gloom is an effective horror game that creeps the player with almost every element implemended. Don't let the pixelated graphics turn you away from this well crafted horror game. "
342360,Train of Afterlife,"Whoa... Didn't realize this game was so expensive! I don't remember exactly how I procured it but I don't remember paying anything close to it. Ah well. It doesn't affect the review much. Perhaps just wait for it to go on sale.   Anyway, moving on the the review. It's a tad confusing and a bit weird but it does all tie up even if some of the plots are loosely knotted up. Basically you have just died and you figured out stuff from your past and who the mysterious boy or girl (you get to choose) named Wing is. Through the power of Tarot and unlocking different ending which give you a passcode, you can progress and learn more of the story.   So I'm gonna go ahead and recommend it but it is an acquired taste. At first, I was like, what the hell is this but it really did grow on me. My only real complaint is I wish there was more to it. It felt a little flat and lackluster. Like it had the potential to be amazing but it just came out ok. But over all? Definitely worth playthrough."
342380,Sakura Angels,Worth Buying.  Only playing it because I got banned off my favorite minecraft server  Priorities.
342450,Sword Daughter,Well I thought this would be a cool fighting fantasty game but it's just some ginger bint after some elf knob.
342480,Gunscape,Connectivity issues and lack of tutorials in the game (which is build mode). Would not recommend this game. Just a piece of poorly asvertised garbage.
342490,Shipwreck,"A mixed bag. Insofar as it goes, it does what it sets out to do well, but it's short, and you'll have every item you're going to get by half-way through, with the last three dungeons free of any items. The bosses are the best thing about it, the dungeons only have three or so unique enemies each, and can become a slog - though I do like the switch puzzles. The items are a lantern, a bow, a sword, a pick that basically works like a sword and is only ever used in one dungeon, and a shield, plus healing items. Besides the pick being necessary to fight one boss, and to open up the entrance to the dungeon, none of these are ever used for any purpose besides the obvious ones. Indeed, after doing a trial where the crossbow hits targets, it's never used for anything but attacking again.  The game system is good, and it plays well, but I'd hold off for this group's second game.   "
342500,Human Extinction Simulator,"This is a very challenging and enjoyable game that you should totally give a whirl. Even when it beat me repeatedly, I was like, 'Yeah, I need to do better, hit me again dealer!' ;)   http://youtu.be/4UqDIJCgObU "
342510,Bret Airborne,"Competative match three with some interesting mechanics. But otherwise pretty mediocre casual game.  Technically it works, but i can't play it without letterboxing on 4:3 even in windowed mode.  Buy one - get one."
342520,BoxesWithGuns,"This game is awesome and its way worth its price. At some points it gets hard to understand whats going on, but its cool :p Game is really fun and addicting. You make your own spaceship and buy guns/upgrades for ur blocks. If your block hits something it gets destroyed but you can put a new block after the level and upgrade it back. Definetly well spent money."
342530,Heroes Never Lose: Professor Puzzler's Perplexing Ploy, Early Access Review
342540,Terminal Hacker - Into the Deep, Early Access Review
342550,Phantasmal,"I really wanted to play this game, but I spent hours trying to figure out how to set it up. At first it started on my second monitor (which is not my primary), so I worked with advanced settings in options to rectify the situation. Of course, on starting the game, no resolution, windowed or otherwise would show the game properly. The UI was beyond glitched, and when I'd adjust settings in game, it would not function the way it should. Scroll bars weren't working, the picture wasn't centered at all, and the image was stretched beyond recognition. It seemed like everything was against all attempts to fix it.  I'd spent my night exiting and restarting the client over and over and over again, to no avail. And, the intro would no longer play after the first attempt. So, that's a no go in every way possible. So, I've now given up.  I'm shocked that this game has come this far without even being tested for efficient functionality. Waste of money.. I'm really disappointed with this product."
342560,Airships: Conquer the Skies, Early Access Review
342570,HIS (Heroes In the Sky),"This game is so bad that it is just a game for me to watch and laugh. First of all, if you crash into anything, you voice off it like a rubber ball. There is no bullet time, and aiming is easy. it's plane graphics and models are redicilus, and fly like a space ship. This game is for if you have a bad computer and want to run something, or if you are just beginning to look for good flight simulators, in which case this is more of that one shady arcade game in the back of a drug store. If you want a really good flight sim, go for War Thunder or DCS world, but those require beefy computers or gaming laptops, so if you are some kid on a chrome book and think you can run anything cause your Minecraft is decent, good luck."
342580,12 Labours of Hercules,It's a fun game but gets repetitive very quickly.
342610,HyperRogue,"Brilliant game! I mean the concept behind the game is simple enough, that of hyperbolic planes, but what the devs have done with that is quite extraordinary. There are several worlds within the game, each with its own rules, it's kinda fun to contemplate how each world works."
342630,Witch's Pranks: Frog's Fortune Collector's Edition,"I noninated this game for the “Villain Most In Need Of A Hug” Award for 2016.  This game is totally good for a giggle or three. The poor witch - all she wanted was a facial, a hairstyle and a prince..."
342650,Fermi's Path,Fun and challenging but not really worth £6. Maybe get it on sale.
342860,Dark Quest,"One of my favorite tabletop games of all times is the one that inspired Dark Quest. This game provides everything I was looking for, and I'm glad the money I paid was well spent. There are a few typos here and there (some of them are very distracting), but that's not an issue. It's a small game studio and any shortcomings don't alter the gameplay at all. I totally recommend it, and I'm looking forward to buy Dark Quest 2 as soon as it is available."
342870,Corona MotorSport, Early Access Review
342890,Synonymy,A good idea but not really delivered as well as it could be. perhaps it's shortcommings might be sorted out in the next version.
342920,Toto Temple Deluxe,  Got this product for free . and it's a very basic game . Good for playing with friends :)
342970,Pixel Survivors,"Update: Since it's been quite awhile since I submitted my last review, though troubled by the onslaught of bugs, hasstle, frustration and to who would have guessed, had fun would be all bundled nicely.. I HAVE tried to work every flaw and enjoy the game.. But what game to enjoy thats just as bare as when I last played it last. You can add more content; but it's bare bones if that doesn't draw you like it feels like it's important.. Food.. Yeah hit or miss out the game. Have fun, maybe next year."
342980,Destination Sol,"Really good starting concept, And I'm really happy to see that a new team is taking care of this game: it has a great potential but it was somehow raw and plain. Now the new team is planning to add new features after some bugfixing so this little game is worth follow it! :D   YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!! BD"
3430,Pizza Frenzy,"Well...that was disappointing. I admit this game was an impulse buy for me. I grabbed it without much research because I thought it was a throwback to the old Pizza Tycoon game of years gone by. Sadly it is not. It is essentially an acarde memory game. Match pizza orders with shops that sell the pizza in question. This is   not    a tycoon game and it is NOT a 'Build Your Own Pizza Simulator' wherein you try to construct innovative pizzas to sell in your restaurant.  This game is gets a negative vote because, unfortunately, no description exists on the store page."
343000,The Mystery of the Druids,"A disaster  I really enjoy point and click adventures. It's by far my favourite genre. This title was enjoyable for the short time I was able to play it.  Unfortunately, I cannot play this game beyond the first 40 minutes or so as there is a fatal crash that I cannot get beyond. I get to a position where I have to give a bone to a lab technician and the game just crashes. What's more it freezes my computer and I can't do anything other than switch it off by the button. It is advertised as playable on Windows 8, but this is not true.  I read on the discussions that many people have had the same problem and yet the developer continues to sell it unpatched. Shocking.  Most definitely NOT recommended."
343020,MagNets,"it is frustrating losing and winning offers no satisfaction, it is torture to play."
343070,World of Subways 4 – New York Line 7,"This game for me is a tale of two halves, it has its positives but mostly negatives.  Positives: Ability to take over services at designated stations Career mode-esque Ability to continue driving the service once the terminus has been reached Some physics  Negatives Water and leaves coming through the train windows.... Sound pack is awful, its the same both inside and out of the train Awful graphic Interface is awful   This is so sad, as many of the features Ihave listed as an issue on this game were dealt with rather well in the London Underground version they made, which is MUCH better."
343090,SimpleRockets,"The name of the game doesent lie. The rockets are simple, but pocket science? Not so much!"
343100,Overture,"This is a weird game to review for me. I barely have time in it, but there isn't much to the gameplay anyway so I feel like playing 10 minutes of it gives you a basic grasp of the game, This game is basically Guantlet, and I love Gauntlet. Why don't I like this game though? Well it's really hard to put my finger on it, but I'd say this game is almost too random? It's hard to describe without bringing Gauntlet into this review and comparing the two.  Let's start off with what this game does right. Fluid movement and shooting, very important. Alternate characters with specialized stats that are actually noticable without getting into numbers. Pretty sprite work with nice designs in enemies, npcs, and playable characters. This game is really fun and easy to play as a twin stick shooter should be.   Now where does this game fall short. Random enemy respawn, this wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't so easy to get swamped. Gauntlet had enemy respawns that were destructable, and not only that but there was also 'melee' in a sense that you can attack while pushing towards enemies in their direction. Upgrading your characters is possible BUT only after unlocking all 24 alternate characters. This obviously would take some time just to upgrade a character you already taken a liking too. Tiny health and mana displays as well as smaller everything seems to a be a problem, when swarmed its hard to read your health meter, see potions, and pick ups.   There's other things that annoy me but these can possibly be changed later. Game seems to be rather buggy, couldn't even progress down the first floor. There was an ad in game, quite silly to include an advert for another game in your game, especially when it seems like you aren't even done with this game (updating it and fixing it so it actually works for everyone)   I don't recommend this game, but that's really because it's my only option. I'd give this game a 5/10 if i could, but steam only lets me 'love or hate' a game. I'll continue playing this game just because it interests me, maybe I'll love it more eventually"
343120,Motorbike,Do not get this! I told my friend but he bought it for me anyways. It will not let me leave menu after you log in and it is very laggy. I have played some video games. This is in the top ten of worst for me.
343140,Cars Radiator Springs Adventures,"I dont know why this game get so much hate.Why i liked is because i played as kid and have big nostalgia from this one too,actually this is the best port of Cars franchise games. Final note:9/10"
343170,Cyberpunk 3776,"I got this for free when I bought Witcher 3, I completely understand why they gave it to me for free, not worth your time! This game is a really cheesy and boring. Even though I got it for free going to try and get a refund for my time wasted on it!"
343180,Top Trumps Turbo,"  Unplayable.  Most of the textures are broken and only show as a blank pink blocks and cards come up as pink rectangles. I recieved a free key for this game, but if I hadn't, I'd be wanting my money back. I don't understand how steam hasn't pulled this broken game from their catalogue.  "
343250,Gene,"Really disappointing. Thought this would be a good game to play with my son, but there's better stuff for free on ipad."
343270,Disillusions Manga Horror,Dont be fooled by the sex appeal. It tries to cover the game with it.         YouTube™ Video:  Dat Game Shorts - Disillusions Manga Horror&nbsp;
343280,Zotrix,"Sort of recommend, but not quite. Definitely get it on sale if you do. Interesting little shooter with a nice retro feeling.  However, the balance is all over the place, most levels are incredibly boring, then you suddenly get a screen full of unkillable enemies, bullets flying everywhere. You initally can't take many hits, until you get the last 2 shields and then you can LITERALLY take ALL the bullets to the face. Quests feel meaningless, there are essentially only 1 type of weapon you can buy, and there's like 4 of them. Had about 1-2 hours of okay fun with it, but I ended up giving up before I finished it simply because there wasn't anything remotely interesting to do anymore."
34330,Total War: SHOGUN 2,must buy............................epic game..
343320,StaudSoft's Synthetic World,"Download the Demo play the Demo and then want more . This is one of the best early dev games I have played , I like the crafting a change from the usuall and easy to understand . Graphics are good for early dev , plenty to craft , maps are filled with caves to explore all in all it is worth buying and supporting the devs."
343340,Tiamat X,That was shi + t
343360,Particula,"Short indie game, but video and sound effects are nice, it's a cheap game so, worth it."
343370,SLAMMED!,"Out of all the Choice of games, games, this one has to be my least favourite, the story it's self will be found lacking to anyone who is not a fan of wrestling, and the decisions given to you don't feel as if they have very much impact."
343390,Elementary My Dear Majesty!,"I love HOG but I really can't recommend this one. First, the 3D and moving cameras thing... It gave me a headache really. I wouldn't be surprised if people that get motion sickness would get nauseated from playing this game... I didn't like the artistic style of the game... It was just not 'pretty' to look at. The cranes and canons parts: You have to guess where to shoot, most of the time it is purely impossible to see where it will end up. The story was poor, after a short while, I couldn't care about the dialogues anymore. Just really not a good game for me."
343410,inSynch,"Highly addictive, hectic andfun, inSynch is the puzzle game that masquerades as a rhythm game. You hit four keys to bump four different blocks into a pit to make the level's song grow and transform into the full song, and that's about it!  Timing is absolutely key."
343430,Hypnosis,a real must have!
343440,Crash Drive 2, Can't believe I used to like this...
343560,Bob Was Hungry,Too difficult... It's giving me stress.... I want a game that I can enjoy.. and not one that'll make me slit my throat.
343570,Rainbow Hero,"Looks like a good game, but it hangs for me on the level named across. I have to ctrl-alt-del to bring up the task to exit. Then I have to start the gymnaistics to convince steams that I am no longer playing the game. Happy to change my review once this is fixed."
343630,CroNix,"This game takes a great concept with good execution, and completely ruins it with either a pay-to-win model or a terrible matchmaking model, I couldn't tell which. My first game, I grabbed the crystal and went to our point where there was an enemy player waiting who was basically invincible, and killed four of us at the same time.  Uninstalling."
343690,Silicone-2,My computer feels violated.........
343710,KHOLAT,"The scenery of the game's world is beautiful and creepy, and combined with the eerie sound effects, is effective in causing chills down your spine. The storyline seems disjointed. I would have wanted the character to be able to jump, climb trees/cliffs, and pick up and use items. The map is seldom useful.   I would recommend this game to anyone in the mood for a chilling atmosphere and a large map for exploration, but not to those looking to debunk myths, kill monsters or solve puzzles - you will not find it in this game."
343730,Irrational Exuberance: Prologue,"What's annoying is that the VR graphics is very unstable, and the Vive VR dome appears every several seconds. The asteroid you're in is made of ugly polygons, and there is no gameplay worth mentioning. The planet globe in the background, while impressive, is just a background image. You can find better view in Google Earth VR or Destination's Earth image.  Don't waste your time downloading this demo."
343740,InMind VR,Short as hell but free. As a demo its a fun intro to VR but if you think of it as a game then you'll be dissapointed.
343750,Firefly Online Cortex,"If you are like me and are eagerly awaiting FireFly Online this is probably the best thing for you to download right now. I spent a few bucks on the ships that they offer in the shop and I really hope they continue to add more starter ships in the shop for me to buy because I am a HUGE ship collector.   Right now the Cortex is all about grinding to get a nice reputation before the game actually starts. If they continue to add more customizable things that you can earn later on when the actual game comes out I would totally say play this for free and go learn about the Firefly solar systems.   Pros: Decent stuff to buy, Though they should update at least every few weeks with more Ships,Customes,Ect for glory of the brown coats Cons: Not the actual game but a pre-set up towards the actual game with original cast and whatnot.  UPDATE 2016: Nothing has been heard from the Developers. It is currently stuck in development hell right now. the login system is bugged and not letting anyone in. don't waste your time."

343810,The Uninvited: MacVenture Series,"A classic point and click horror game. It was a horror game back then, cut it some slack. One of the many classic Point and Click games from the early PC era. Many twists and turns and wierd stuff over all like any PaC. Definetly recommended for PaC fans."
343820,Deja Vu: MacVenture Series,"A fun detective game, you might think? Well, definitions of 'fun' might vary, but this certainly isn't 'fun'.  I first saw this game the day it was released on steam, and bought it, hoping I could play it and post a review before others could. I tried to like it. I really did. But I just couldn't. Half an hour of frustration led up to the moment where I just shut down the game and left it to rot in my library. The following review is based upon these 30 minutes, and believe me, I couldn't find more problems with this game in this amount of time.  The game is a port of the 1985 original. (I thought) I knew what I was expecting; pixelated graphics and cheesy sound effects. I was right on the first part. The same goes for the second part, though I was only able to find one sound effect; you punching items and people (and yourself).  The inventory system the game has is very frustrating. You have to drag items you find to a little window which is labeled 'inventory'. You've got your inventory. You can move a jacket into your inventory. In your jacket is a wallet. In your wallet is your money and other junk. In order to get to your money, you have to open every inventory window separately. If you want all your items in your 'first' inventory, you'll have to spend a lot of time just moving all your items, and when you're finally done doing that, your inventory will be a mess. Some items look alike, which makes it even harder to figure out what's what.  There are eight operations you can perform on items during the entire game, some of which just imply each other (operate-&gt;open/close/consume). The game is horribly unforgiving. There are multiple events, even at the beginning of the game, in which you have no idea what's happening and end up getting shot. You've got little to no time to open your inventory, open an inventory in the inventory, take out your gun and shoot. When you're dead, you wished that you saved at some point in the game. This game has no autosave whatsoever (well, it's 1985. What did you expect?).  I see no reason why I should continue playing this game. There are no achievements. The story can be found in many other games/movies/comics. Not even the fact that it features trading cards would make me play it again. Avoid this game at all costs; even when it's on sale, it's not worth it. Even if you invent a time machine and go back to 1985, don't get this game."
343830,Deja Vu II: MacVenture Series,This game is classic. Found myself laughing and laughing each time I did something stupid and random. I still remember playing the originals and brings back memories even in real life where I made similar choices. Be prepaid for MisAdventures!!
343930,Fort Defense,"This garbageware crashed the first time I ran it, then once it opened the second time I found you can only run it in fullscreen, or windowed. You can't maximize the window, and you can't run the game in windowed-fullscreen. So, your options are to have the game taking over the entire screen while losing the ability to see your taskbar, or, a tiny little window floating in the middle of the desktop at some ridiculously undersized resolution. I can't find an .ini to override and my 3rd party resizer apps don't seem to work with this piece of crap game either.  It's 2016 and coders are still pulling this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonsense."
343990,Anti-Opoly,Really good game! Would recommend it.
344030,Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island,"This game is not for everyone. I am one of those. I tried to play it but the intro itself is kinda dry. The graphics arent that great. The random music doesnt help. Also, make sure to hit save before you quit the game or else all your progress will be gone."
34410,Death to Spies: Moment of Truth,"At its best, it feels like a World War 2 version of Hitman mixed with elements of Meta Gear Solid 3.  At its worst, it feels like a linear game with such a tight focus on what it wants you to do and how it expects you to do things that it doesn't leave enough room for freedom of choice without feeling like you've made the wrong choice.  I'd recommend it to any hardcore stealth fans, but if you're not someone who's invested in the stealth genre, stay away."
344130,Cataegis : The White Wind,Nope
344160,World of Cinema - Movie Tycoon,Really wanted this to be a better Tycoon game. Showtime! is a better Movie Tycoon. Don't buy this one.
344180,Valiant, Early Access Review
344190,Immortal Empire,"Interesting old-school tactical game that allows multiple players in the same instance fighting either against each other or against the same enemy.  It's your typical Turn-Based controls, but with the twists of the fantasy RPG inventory and classes.  While many things are locked behind the option of a 1-time payment or many hours of gameplay, it should only matter those who really are keen on that part as you can still access half of the characters for free.  The game does lack in terms of informations about the systems of the game such as leveling is based on your 'profile' and not the characters so, initially, you level your main character and as you unlock more character slot in your party, you notice you can only level 1 character for each of level... so you gotta redo the same quests again and again to level multiple characters which can easily become a pain in the butt for many. (You can reach the max level of 250 and each character has up to 80 skills points, meaning you can max 3 character at most or sacrifice some characters' skills' level.)  While I recommend this game, a warning about the multiplayer side of the game. To be honest, currently, the game barely have enough players as it is... Especially new players. You might find 1-4 new players and that's it. The remaining are high level players. Will they help/play with you? Maybe... but that remove lot of the fun factor.  Still, it's a fun game so Yup, recommended.  P.S. The game is build in Flash so yeah... it's a Flash game which might come with issues if you play it with something like an Integrated Video Card on a laptop. You might have to painfully access some option to make the game appears correctly."
34420,XIII Century,Support game by later added multiple languages. Makes it a positive for me.

344270,InnerCube,"Puzzle game... you have a dice with 6 different colors, one on each face. Now you flip it around on a grid until you hit the tiles with the matching colors... extremely boring"
344300,Heckabomb,"its old school game, this game make me sick 'thumbs up'"
344340,Front Office Football Seven,"*****edit**********  game has a super steep learning curve, and it's like using windows 98. However this simulator is excellent, especially given the fact that it was essentially made by one person. I hope that the GUI can be vastly improved upon in this games next iteration. 10/10   do again."
344410,Magnetic: Cage Closed,"If you enjoy 3D puzzle games you will like this game. I got it because it looked very similar to Portal, which I loved. In terms of story, it is basically identical: you use an experimental gun to solve puzzles, or the evil scientists experimenting on you kill you. However, it feels like a completely different game. Puzzles are solved by pulling or pushing boxes, and using magnetic forces to shoot yourself through the air. The way that puzzles are solved feels very unique to me.  I currently am both a little frustrated with the puzzle I am stuck on and wanting to play more, so you know it is a good puzzle game. I am certainly not disappointed."
344440,Sacra Terra: Angelic Night," Seven Deadly Sins, Seven Ways To Win..."
344500,Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition,"  I played this game and I liked it.I am new to visual novels/short stories(all kinds) and this is one that I particularly liked because of the melancholic feeling that you get while you are driving through the really bad/dangerous weather conditions and learning the past of the protagonist,Kelly, who is talking with her familly while she is trying to get home as soon as possible because of the devastating tornadoes.Through that talk we learnclots of things such as her father's dissability, her brothers's mental problem and generally about other familly problems of hers.This game is very realistic in terms of dialogue and, I don't know about the others but, the ending leaves the player with a complicated feeling of depression and unreassurement(yeah I know that I just made my own word but I can't explain it in another way).I also find her brother's stories entertaining as the were well-writen and with a taste of fantasy.To tell the truth in contrast of the dozens of comments I've read ,I want what happenes after Kelly hangs on the phone and reaches home.All in all I liked this game and I would recommend it to people who would like to play something short interesting.You should spend about 5 hours,it is woth of it.BTW I haven't finished playing it yet,I am trying to get the radio achievement. :D    Ps: I got this game for free (no I won't tell you from where)so I cannot compare the game's quality with its price but I think that it deserves to be sold for about 5€."

344760,Reign Of Kings,"Remade Review of my Earlier Review:  Pros: - Average Survival System - Decent Armor and Clothing but Doesnt fit well with new helmets - Building is decent, but laggy - Kings throne - Very good well made Execution Machines - Good sieging Tactics  Cons: - Unbalanced fighting - Bad hitboxes (You know this) - Staff only replies to Positive Comments and feedback, they delete Negative feedback and send Their minions towards the negative reviewers - Hackers - Very laggy in terms of Connection - Badly optimized - Official servers are Unplayable - Not compatible with all computers - Toxic community - Hidden hackers (Worse) like Auto stamina hacks and etc   Would Recommend playing on community servers and If you are new to PC games. You should immerse yourself but there will be consequences  5/10"
344770,fault - milestone two side: above,"This is an excellent continuation of the Fault saga. The translation work is much better than in the first episode and there's plenty of new insight into characters. I don't know why a visual novel needs two pointless achievements mind you but I'm not an achievement hunter so it doesn't matter too much. What does matter, however, is that this episode isn't 'complete' in any sense and if you're hoping to get some resolution by the end of it... that's not going to happen. Which now means a long wait for the next episode. If you're a fan, buy this, but if not - you might want to wait until the series is somewhere near complete."
344790,Mystery Masters: Psycho Train Deluxe Edition,"I may be spoiled for quality, but I found this game to be mediocre, with just a series of one-to-another click pieces. The puzzles aren't challenging. The story, while stimulating in parts, makes it playable at best. It wasn't a waste of my time, but I can't recommend it in good conscience."
344800,World of Mixed Martial Arts 3,Great game for MMA fans. Not to say that it doesn't have it's problems but MMA sims are hard to find in the first place and this certainly among the top tier. Easy to get into and can keep you occupied for days on end.
344810,Total Extreme Wrestling 2010,"This game is fun but really hard, especially at first. I can assemble a good roster and a good backstage, but I can't figure out how to book properly. If anyone is good at booking and wants to give me tips on it I woud be very happy. Overall this game is still enjoyable since I love wrestling and may even start my own company someday."

344890,ARM Planetary Prospectors Episode 1, Early Access Review
344900,Undeadz!,"Nice game. Needs a few additions (more guns and weapons, Vehicles maybe?) otherwise a great game for a few miutes of mesing around!"
344910,Sun Blast,"Dont buy this game for more than a dollar. If you're expecting a fun space adventure like starfox or at least a fun shoot 'em up adventure like Panzer Dragoon, you're going to be dissapointed.   This game is functional, yes. It plays fine. However, its got bare minimum functionality. You shoot and move through space, occasionally getting power-ups. Don't ask what they do, the game doesnt tell you. How do you use them? You dont. They're auto applied to your ship and you lose them when you get hit.   Your ship (whichever of the three you chose, it wont really matter. They control slightly differently, but its not a major change) is always at the front of the screen and the camera scrolls you forward. enemies/obstacles pop up (and I mean pop up, its like it was made on the n64 the popup is so bad) so you can never tell where they're going to be. The field of view is incredibly small. There is a real lack of any substance. Yeah, you're in space shooting stuff, but it lacks all the things that made games like starfox cool  You dont see those squadrons of enemies approaching, battling in the background. Sometimes you're lucky if you get a planet background instead of black emptiness with the hyperspeed lines from starwars to indicate you're moving fast.  Boss battles arent anything special either. No cinematics, no sense of danger, no challenge. They just feel like regular enemies with health meters.   Also, there is no story in game. The game gives you about 0 feedback on anything that is going on. So, read up on the lore before playing, otherwise you'll be lost fighting the most uninspired aliens I've ever seen.   I think I played for 15 minutes. I dont think I'll pick it back up any time soon. Not really worth my play time, and chances are its not worth yours.   Its actually a port of a Wii ware game from 2009. So, dont expect anything of it at all. At 24 cents, I feel like I barely got what I payed for. There are flash games with more content."
344960,Jaques Roque,"  Jaques Roque - A Steam Review      The good:      Eazy to understand puzzle elements    Low system requirements     The not so good:     The lack of new features makes the puzzles become boring pretty fast   Lots of typos and mistranslations in the english version   No undo button, so you have to restart the level after even a small mistake     The conclusion:    Nice puzzle game that can be played on any system, but riddled with bugs and some poor design choices. I would hold off of buying this until a sale.  You can watch me playing it here -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geF03Vy9ErU "
3450,Typer Shark! Deluxe,"While the design of this game/application is done pretty well, but the execution of it is lacking. I have windows 10 on my desktop where this game is installed. Not only does this game not propperly terminate when instructed to exit, but it also triggers all sorts of warnings from my AVG protection. When exiting the game, it will minimize, but the popcapgame1 process is still active. You will be unable to restart the game until you manually kill the process in Task Manager. Even though this game is only $5 it is not worth the hassle, and I would strongly suggest not even giving it a spin."
34500,Light of Altair,Interesting setting and simple mechanics make this game a blast to play when you have an hour of spare time.
345010,Ascent - The Space Game,"This game is enjoyable and worth the $20. That is not to say, however, that it is not without flaws. This review will cover both, starting with the things that this game does right:  With much to do and a fair amount of freedom, this game won't bore you for quite a while. An actual economy driven by the players' transactions   Screw it. This game is fun and worth the price, even if the controls are a bit weird. I don't want to spend too much time on this review so that I can get back to playing. You will most likely enjoy this game; 9.2/10."
345030,3d Engineers,"Lots of people complaining about this game, and while the controls are a little odd they're still simple enough a monkey could figure it out in five mintues with just the first two tutorial levels. The graphics aren't ultra-real pixar animated but the physics are in fact what count here as you build your way through the scenarios. You learn real quick when thicker beams/ropes are necessary vs when a lighter object will work, and the truck literally couldn't be easier to drive around unless they did it for you (which wouldn't work because some of what you have to do is pretty interesting). The only issue I've encountered is laying down road tiles, sometimes they'll snap to full shape properly and sometimes they'll tell you it's too much. Scrap it and try again. All around a solid 8/10 if you like a bit of challenge while you build stuff, higher if you don't care how good it looks while you do it. Still a better love story than 50 shades."
345060,Stay Alight,"Long story short: a mobile game, ported to PC and poorly optimized. Lag spikes, FPS drops, and all that.  What about gameplay? Well, it's just another  Angry Birds  clone (that's why the game wasn't really popular on mobile -- market's fed up with games like that).  Yeah, the graphics are alright, I guess, but that doesn't really help with how boring this game is. Sounds and music are bland, gameplay is something we've seen a thousand times, and... that's about it.  Is it worth $3.99 dev's asking for it? Definitely not. Is it worth picking up on a sale? On a 90% sale, maybe, if you're a really big fan of Angry Birds. Otherwise, nah, skip it."
345080,Flame Over,Terrible game. Very frustrating
345090,Ancient Planet,"Easy to learn, not that hard to master. Sounds/soundtrack are fine. The game explains necessary steps nice and easy. And except for 2-3 levels kicking your ♥♥♥ because you most probably left out certain upgrades, the game flow is good. So you either focus your upgrades, or spread around, but either way sooner or later you'll have to do some grinding for skill points. Earlier levels pose no threat so that's the place to go. You can soften up the grinding by replaying levels in order, less repetitive. The grinding isn't as bad as say it is.  After all, it's moderately challenging, you have to know your enemies weaknesses and plant turrets accordingly. Some tough nuts but just keep trying.  2 enemy categories, each with one weakness. Turrets have 2 kinds of elements accordingly. Really simple.   Easy achievements, pretty good for tower defense novices. You even have 3 game profiles so you can start over with a different approach just like that.  For me, there are only 3 relatively minor design flaws: 1. Survival Mode access shouldn't be blocked by 'beat the game'. Why go the extra mile if you've seen everything? 2. sound effects are not overlapping, which is good but makes looking at shooting turrets without sound weird 3. terrain not suitable for turrets should look like it and vice versa, which is true for most but not all levels"
345120,Vox Populi Vox Dei 2,"Prepare to play a hard, sick and very short game/episode. I liked it, ripping some wolves apart was great : )"
345130,Dark Matter,  the game is alight im not the best at it but i got it for free so i cant complain
345140,Crystal Rift,"I have the HTC Vive because VR where I cannot move myself around will make me sick. I saw this was made for the Rift and wondered if I should try it, and the fact that you are able to use the motion controllers made the decision for me. It couldn't be that bad if you could choose a controller right? Well, for many people it would be true, but not for me. The movement system is very rigid and put me over a toilet to collect my lunch fast. I loved what I saw of the game before that though. Dungeon crawlers were the first type of game I ever played and the toggle in the setting menu for level of scares had me very intrigued. Maybe I'll come back to this game later if the movement has changed. I can't say I liked the way it made me feel, but I know there's others out there with stronger stomachs that can handle it. And I would highly reccomend this game to them,"
345180,Victor Vran,"Okay, let's get the main thing out of the way first - Victor Vran is a FUN game &amp; worth buying. I got it during the AWESOME 2016 winter sales. Now, let's be completely honest - Victor Vran does nothing new. It is a blatant Diablo 3/Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing clone, and quite frankly, I can always use some more of that excellent gameplay. It's that simple, really - if you enjoyed playing Diablo or Van Helsing(or Grim Dawn), you will dig Victor Vran - if you are looking for something unique or different, then you'll need to look elsewhere."
345200,Tasty Blue,I am going to play it sometimes since I nearly spent 7 bucks on it but this does not mean I like it.

345240,SHOGUN: Total War™ - Collection,"I bought this as the original never worked on Windows 10. This worked fine and I was overjoyed. Trouble is, it no longer works, keeps crashing like the original. If you haven't bought it already then don't; Shogun Total War does NOT work on Windows 10 any longer. (December 2016) and I doubt anyone will release a fix unless 1,000's of players mention it."
345260,MEDIEVAL: Total War™ - Gold Edition,"This is one of my top five favorite games of all time, but the version released on Steam simply doesn't work. It crashes constantly, and that's assuming the game even starts. If you're wondering if you should buy this one, look at all of the posts on the Steam forums and all of the reviews complaining about crashes. Let those be your guide."
345280,Lost in a Forest,"how the ♥♥♥♥ you can win, when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monster keep following you every ♥♥♥♥ing second =.= and its boring as ♥♥♥♥."
345290,The Quivering,"I honestly could not believe it when I randomly searched this classic game from my childhood today and it popped up as being able to be downloaded on Steam. This game is and always has been an absolute gem. Undoubtedly the games strength lies in the voice acting and sense of humor and irony and it's very well done and genuinely hilarious. There's an underlying British-type 'An American Werewolf in London' style of humor that everyone might not appreciate, but I honestly haven't found a game since that has made me laugh so much (The phantom of the opera is my favorite character). The story is a good length split across two parts and there's some very scary moments (The Fun House still haunts me to this day and I'm 21). It's PACKED full of references to classic horror films and the game-play is a point-and-click style typical of games of this age, and the graphics are too, don't expect a graphical phenomenon; saying that the cut-scenes (And there's a lot of them) still look pretty good. Lots of puzzles too, usually involving using items in conjunction with one another.   I had the pleasure of talking to one of the developers on the game a few years back and they had such a tiny development team and audience it's incredible that it's up here. Thanks developers, thanks Steam!"

345370,TyranoBuilder Visual Novel Studio,"Review written: 1/4/2017(USA) 4/1/2017(Everyone else)   Last updated: 1/4/2017(USA) 4/1/2017(Everyone else)  I'm so sorry Tyranobuilder crew, I love your program. I know this might hurt (Or not) But what I'm about to say is because I like your program and want to see you improve since I know you can.  (Think fatherly love, with less belt whipping)  TL;DR. It's a great starter tool, somewhat limited however, and it seems like development on improving has gone quiet from what I can tell. The only sign of developement life is the ideas thread  Pros: +Easy to learn +Easy to use +Great price for what you get +Tutorials are very helpful (On website) +Page of commands are avalable (Also on their website) +Great stability (The only time this has crashed on me was when I screwed up on my end) +Moderators are quick to respond helpfully to any support threads +Bunch of 'functions' to move into place rather than typing it (This is also a downside, look at #5 of Cons)  Middle ground stuff (Great name I know): +/- in an attempt to make it easy for early script learners (Atleast I hope that's why) Tyranobuilder is somewhat limited compared to other programs  So that raises the question, 'why use Tyranobuilder after you get the basic grasp of scripting?' The only anser I seem to have found is 1. a simple interface and 2. 'Live2D' (I'm too lazy to explain this, google it yourself)  Cons: - You WILL need to learn to write your own scripts after you get beyond simple things such as having a character say something, changing a scene, or playing music. Don't buy this expecting to be able to make an entire fully developed visual novel without learning to script. Think training wheels - Somewhat limited compared to other programs (You'll have to write 90% of the stuff on your own, so why use Tyranobuilder?) - No fullscreen (windowed fullscreen doesn't count, don't lie) - Entire game window tends to get blurry as you increase the resolution - Some things seem convoluted, For example most of the time it's better to have a character say something via Tyranoscript rather than.. you know.. THE TEXT FUNCTION - No 3d models. NO, LIVE2D IS NOT WHAT I MEAN BY THIS, THAT IS DIFFERENT! - You can't zoom out of the project list, so have fun going through that list after it gets longer than 30 'Text, scene changes, whatevers' (A search option does not fix this problem) - it seems like development on improving and adding features has slowed down somewhat (last update was in August of 2016, and as far as I can tell the devs have been rather quiet besides the 'Official Suggestion List' in the community discussions   Every discussion on that thread goes like this  Customer 'What if we add this feature that makes it easier to do a critical thing without writting a custom script, thus making it easier to do and saving people time!'  Developer/Moderator 'Oh that looks cool, we could add that!' *Precides to either* A. Never mention it again. or B. Put it on the 'Suggested list' where it will 'probably' never be brought up again  Current list of Suggested list List posted: 1/4/2017(USA) 4/1/2017(Everyone else)   Last updated: 1/4/2017(USA) 4/1/2017(Everyone else)  -Steam Workshop (this is a highly requested feature and agree to the value that it would be for the community) -Multiple Text Box Windows -Branch Preview Tree to show how dialog is connected to what routes -Compile directly to an APK ready for Android publishing -Configurable Keyboard Shortcuts -Steamworks support 'Achievements' -Save As for multiple project versions (highly requested feature) and the ability to save outside of the default folder. -Colored Names for Characters speaking -Rich Text Editing like Italics and Centering Fonts -Grouping Components or -Indenting branched segments  -Text Shadows -Add sound effects to each of the buttons - The ability to add more buttons to the menu.

Currently sounds don´t play on .apk generated by Tyrano Builder because it´s dependencies are old. -CG gallery manager -More transition types for jumps from scenes, and transitions within a scene like characters coming and going -Premade sound effects library -Make the quake function not show the black background -setting to add sound effect to the 'typing of the text' -Sort project list by the last date modified -Ability to control image layers directly through components instead of coding -Removal of individual images instead of everything at once when using the 'Remove Image' component. -Changing cursor for mouseover/hover over clickables -Make the positioning tool view in small scale (no need show the actual screen size while editing) so we can see the whole game screen while editing the character positioning. -Resetting gifs when they are played a second time rather then them staying on the last frame when using preview (works as suggested on exported version) -Voice over support for text -Settings menu in game for: audio, resolutions, and skipping -Ability to type out the position of UI buttons in the editor  -Support for swf files -Undo and Redo for text (current undo only supports removing components)  Can't post any more cause the review length limit but you get the idea.."

345430,The Cursed Forest, Early Access Review
345440,Vapour,  Very graphic and confusing game not well made.   Also very unususal and weird.   Not recommended.
345480,Lumo,"  Lumo is an isometric platformer/adventure with some puzzle elements in it. The game's camera angle provides much of the challenge, as well as offering unique gameplay that is rarely seen in games today. There are two difficulty modes in Lumo: adventure, and old-school. Adventure mode offers unlimited lives and allows the player to make as many mistakes as needed, only resetting them to the beginning of the room when they die. Old-school mode, on the other hand, offers a limited amount of lives and forces the player to be much more cautious in their playing if they want to make it through the whole game. Lumo offers a lot of variety in gameplay, with each area in the game having its own unique set of mechanics, keeping the gameplay fresh the whole way through. There is also a large amount of hidden content and challenges scattered throughout the game, providing an incentive for multiple playthroughs. You will die, you will get frustrated, you will curse the camera, and you will have a ton of fun in the process. Overall, Lumo is a great game and I highly recommend it."
345540,Inbetween Land,"I know it's a radical idea, but when doing localizations, it might be a good idea to use a font that, you know, supports the characters of the language. Don't buy this if you were going to play it in Czech. But even if you're playing it in a language that it properly supports, it's still probably pretty boring. It's only worth buying for a couple dollars in a sale."
345580,Universal Combat CE,"Hello, I am a french fellow passenger, I am a 'child' of the first step of Neil Armstrong on the moon. My dream it's a travel space, is not possible!!! But Mr Derek SMART do that! Congratulations. Universal Combat CE 2.0 is a good son of Battlecruiser Millénium Gold. Good idea for this games séries. Lovely ROAM free explorer! You know what? I am happy! One Billion Thanks Mr SMART, good luck for the future."
345610,The Fruit of Grisaia,"  Honestly Im surprised by how amazing this game is, I never expected it to be this kind of experience.  With 60 Hours+ avaliable game time this game is a must-buy if you enjoy Visual Novels. 10/10"
345620,The Labyrinth of Grisaia,"All it is is 10 hours of fan service via the after stories, 10 hours of actually cool plot stuff with Yuuji's backstory that just totally lacks the time needed to get properly invested in the characters that are introduced, some of which you already should know the fates of.  Plus, a lot of it is downright  wrong  feeling. Stuff like   Yuuji sleeping with JB and his master   is kinda disgusting since he's meant to be what, 15/16 at the time?   I don't think the stuff with Kazuki is as bad since that is meant to be a ♥♥♥♥ed up family. But when it's him banging his foster parents who are meant to be the good guys then it just feels bad.    Don't bash on the price for being expensive. Bash on it for being too much for too little, and what little there is isn't of high enough quality to justify the price.   First game is way better. If the third game is good, then you'll have to buy and read this to know the background."
345640,Block Legend DX,Pretty addicting.

345660,RIDE: Game,Clunky game in every aspect.  No joy here... Get Ride 2 the game this should have been in the first place.
345700,Echo Tokyo: An Intro,"First off you have to know this is not a Game but a graphic novel and it's not a Hentai Game. You won't experience any real gameplay or real nudity but instead click through text boxes.  First off a positive aspect of this 'game' is the very good voice acting which is brilliantly done for both characters Shizume und Keiji.  But: the game or the novel is very short, in Shizume's story there are like 3 decisions to make which influence the story; by influence I mean if you pick the wrong thing Shizume will die and the story ends, wich means u play it once (for 10 minutes until you're through it) and that's it, no need to replay this ever again. The story is not that interesting either und if you expect some Henati stuff you'll definitly be dissapaointed (just like I was) no nudity in this bro, just some minor boobage (in Shizume's Story of course).  In Keiji's story there isn't even a decision to make, you just click through this very confusing story until it ends (after about 5 minutes).  The music in this game is quite nice but it's just one short Track which repeats and it can get annoying.  I really did not like the artstyle of this game. Dhakrer Studios has done much better looking 'games'; this looks more like a School Project from an Art Studient who's into some Anime but learned drawing it through cheep 'How to draw Manga and Anime Characters' Books.  I cannot recommend this game because it looks dull, has no real gameplay and the story isn't interesting enough to make that up and it's short as hell.  I know it's a cheap buy, but don't waste your time on this. Dharker Studios has made better Games of this type like for example 'Club Life', you should get this instead of this boring and cheap looking graphic novel."
345710,Damned Nation Reborn, Early Access Review
345750,Idol Hands,"Positives: Easy to learn game! I figured out how to do everything even before the tutorial was completed. Very simple graphics, so it runned great on my old laptop (Which is 5 years old.) It's kid friendly, and I was not sure wether I was playing a childrens game, or a adult game. I'd say it's perfect for kids. It has some great charm, and the kind sensation the game gives a impression off, feels really good! It lightened my mood. Cool graphics when lowering land!  Negatives: I couldn't descide what buildings to build, and where to place them. The Furlings did that for me. I really disliked that. There was no way to make roads, and more fancy looking towns. There was no structure, or streets, walls for protection etc. Just a town, and all I could do as a 'God' was to create land. And I could do some natural powers, such as rain, lightning, vulcano, etc. But those got old, pretty fast, because of the graphics when shooting one off. Annoying to see it come up in a circle every single time, and being locked to it... And making a pathway from one hight level to the other was hard, seeing as how when I just lower ground it is in the shape of a hand, while highening lang was more 'correct' in my head, as it highed only a nice radius around my cursor. The game only had 8 levels, and 3 bonus levels. The last bonus level was dissapointing, even though I get why it was as it was. But the game story in general was very dissapointing. I had hoped for a bigger challenge, and a longer story. It seemed to me, as if the developers gave up on it.   I'm sorry, but I would not reccomend buying this game."
345790,Bridge Creator 2015,"This game is ok, and has better interface than most other bridge builder sims out there from what i noticed. However its lacking gameplay. I havent played it long enough to unlock its full potential. but its first impressions are slow at showing it. "
345820,Shantae and the Pirate's Curse,"A metroidvania title (my favorite genre in 2D games) staring a cute dark skinned belly dancing girl with purple hair? Sold, you already convinced me to play this game. Thankfully, the gameplay turned out to pretty damn good too"
345860,Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo,"While I had really fun playing this one I can't recommend it. The game has some parts which can make it very challenging like the hardcore mode and endless mode, which is great. The scoring in normal mode is totally deifferent. It seems to reward bad play over good play leaving veterans and scorechaser fallen apart or losing their ability do dodge right. There is one achievement, where you have to get hit multiple times get a high enough score by taking your fallen powerups. For me this just didn't feel right.   The powerup system is a nice idea though. You can upgrade your main shot up 8 times your firerate 5 times and your secondary weapon 7 times. The ships felt quite balanced. There are enough ships for everyone's playstyle.  If your health reaches zero your ship explodes and the stage starts again.  But as stated in the first half of my review the game doesn't seem to reach the requirement for me to recommend it to other bullethell fan unless you want to try the hardcore mode which gonna kill you at the stage bosses.   The artstyle is o.k. for me. Nothing special. The stage bosses have highlighted parts when struck and are destructable. The patterns itself are mostly very easy to get through except for the last level propably, which is another reason for me not recommend it.   If you want to spend some money for a help programm you can still buy this game and have fun with it.  Overall the game is fun to play and has enough variety to play it from time to time, but for bullethellfans and veterans of shmups I can't recommend it since there are other titles you gonna buy earlier before this one: e.g. Crimzon Clover, Exceed series, Siter Skain's games,Mushimesama etc."
345990,ABRACA - Imagic Games,This game is really bad.  It's a great concept and the character designs are really great. There's a lot of effort that went into making this game very artistically apealling but the mechanics and design are really hard to deal with. There are many different game modes and you can tell a lot of effort went into their design but it tries to be too much and gets spread too thin. The controls are incredibly clunky despite how easy they are to work with. A lot of the game modes are incredibly boring and drawn out. I only played this game 30 minutes and it felt like 6 hours of perpetual boredom. I was trapped in some kind of hell that had cute fluffy creatures that laughed at every tiny struggle I had.
3460,Talismania Deluxe,"All Pop Cap's games are just perfect. Easy to learn, 'plug &amp; play' but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects.... Well, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them. Highly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that 'in between big games' time. ONE OF THE WEAKESTS BUT, ENSSURED PLAYABILITY."
34600,Order of War,"I did not like it. Its very basic. The same units, hoards of same t34/75 tanks against hoards of reinformecemnts of Pz III. I doesnt really matter if your units are well placed and outflanked enemy tanks, what counts is being able to send reinforcemnts quickly. Infantry is just a liitle neusance that bugs tanks, Those who liked Blitzkrieg, Sudden Strike and Men of War shouldn buy it. I got bored on the second mission. And , bytw, in 1944 i doubt anyone would have amassed so many igual outdated units."

346090,I Can't Escape: Darkness,"not as fun as i had anticipated, the random generation of the dungeon is mostly cosmetic, lack of weapons and spells, lack of moneter types, and lack of information on how to deal with monsters, quickly becomes repetitive, even with the random generation of the dungeon as there seams to be only a few permetations, in my oppinion not worth the £7 i payed for it, you may like it more than me, but try see some streams of it first, may help you decide to save your cash,  twitch.tv/tersse , i have a few up and on my youtube channel tersse b, check it out before you buy is my recomendation."

346140,Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1,"I noticed in the reviews some people complaining that one of the games doesn't work. I too had this problem with 'Behind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge' However I have a solution. If you go into the properties for the application file and tell it to run in 640 by 480 resolution the game runs fine. Only thing to remember is to turn this off when playing the other games as it destorts their graphics a bit. Other than that I've only played on game so far but it was fairly standard fair for hidden object puzzle games, so pretty much exactly what I wanted."
346150,Martial Law, Early Access Review
346160,Barter Empire,"The game itself is not too bad, it was interesting. However on two different computers I the video does not work well, likely because the resolution is so off. The drivers need to be updated to better fit modern screens and refresh rates."
346180,David.,"This game tugged at my last remaining heartstring just a little bit. I can't help myself. Games that only have a single developer make me go, 'Awww!' uncontrollably. I turn into a little Japanese school girl. And I hate it.  David. is a story about a little block named David who has the ability to charge a powerful blast of energy and slow time simultaneously. There's evil out there. It's bad. David has to end the bad stuff. And that's where you come in!  David is a 2D frenzy-arena where you are set against different enemies with different attack strategies and you have to learn when to dodge, when to shoot, and when to slow down the clock. Of course, the game is a bit broken in your favor, as you can slow down time whenever you want so you'll often find yourself slowing down the entire fight until you get into the right position to fire at your opponent. Whenever you don't, David and everything else in the arena will fly so fast that you'll hardly be able to click on David to slow time, let alone register what the hell is even happening.  Despite what flaws there are in the gameplay, it is unique enough to warrant a 1-hour long playthrough, which was what I got out of it. Go into David with the same expectations as other indie titles like Over the Void and Hook. Expect some unique gameplay showcased in a very short amount of time. And I do mean very short. I beat this game in a little over and hour. However, with online rankings and a few extra games (and even a cute little hat given to you at the end... for some reason) will give you some reason to come back and keep playing David, if that suits you.  Personally, I love David because it has so many things in it that make it a distinctly indie game. It's got the 8-bit music and graphics with a modern twist, references to King David and the different deadly sins found in the Bible (along with Wolf and Flee... for some reason), and the fact that this was made by one guy alone. I really appreciate someone who has the gonads to go out and make a whole game all by themselves, and for what it's worth... I'd say this is a well-made game for being made by one guy.  That being said, it's nowhere near perfect. Despite the broken time mechanic, the story is very dry. It's a simple introduction with a bunch of interspersed levels and a big boss battle with Sin itself. It presents everything very simply in that quirky manner that a lot of indie devs like to do, and even that 'Thank you' page at the end warmed my black little atheist heart a little bit. He thanked Jesus. He thanked Jesus! I shook my head and smirked upon seeing that, seeing someone so adamantly devoted to their faith that they have to point out Jesus for helping them with making a game. It was adorable to the point, that it warranted an ironic chuckle out of me.  If David looks like fun to you, it probably will be. It's well-made, and makes for a good one-hour time waster. I'd say it was worth the money I put towards it, and if you like little quirky indie games, David is right up your alley. It may not have blown my mind like other indie titles, but it certainly charmed my spirit because of its authenticity alone. I'm giving David a 6/10."
346200,Drew and the Floating Labyrinth,"Walk the invisible path of boxes and fall simuator. The mechanics constantly have you looking at the box the character is standing on and away from your destination which is uninviting, unintuitive, and causes the frame to contstantly be empty. The boxes do not rise up fast enough which causes the character to walk on nothing for several frames. Music is bleak and quickly annoying. Gameplay was repetitive, uningaging and quickly became boring. I did not bother beyond the first series of stages."
346210,Garden Rescue,"Garden Rescue is a cute and colorful tower defense game in which you use defensive plants to protect money-making strawberry plants from invading pests. Sound sort of familiar? Basically, it's Plants vs. Zombies without the zombies, and with more conventional tower defense level design (i.e. winding pathways).   There is nothing revolutionary here, but the game is really cheap and can be picked up for even less during sales or in bundles. It would be a good game for kids or casual players since it isn't difficult or gory, but if formulaic tower defense isn't your thing then you should probably just skip this one.   One bonus, the Steam achievements can be tracked via the in-game trophy room, which will tell you how far along you are towards hitting each of the requirements. Widescreen support is also a plus."
346220,Lif,no one plays anymore.
346240,Ski Park Tycoon,Simply does not work on my pc (980 i7 16gb ram) i load the game and get black with occasional colours across the screen. Sure i get a lot of hate for this review but if it doesn't work on the latest nvidia drivers this is a pretty big negative point in my opinion.
346250,The Old Tree,"A very short, but endearing experience. It's work 10-15 minutes of your time."
34630,Massive Assault,I absolutely recommend this game. It has provided me with hours and hours and fun and entertainment. Seriously! I continue to reenstall it over and over cause it has turned into one of my fallback titles.
346320,Streets of Chaos,"Jo its me Sh4rky, straight outta Gehttoo, this game sux."
346330,BrainBread 2, Early Access Review
346340,Gran Vitreous,"- Just a cluster**** of flashy particles on the screen. Much more than you see in the trailer. No way to tell if stuff is bullets, enemies, bonuses or just particles and explosions. No option to tone it down. So you often just fly through stuff and _hope_ it doesn't kill you. - No rebindable controls. - Crashes."
346370,Into The War,"lolwat, the game does literally 0  Edit: To be clear, this is by far the worst game I have ever seen, its like someone worked on it for a day and then got bored of it"
34640,Massive Assault: Phantom Renaissance,One of the best strategy games ever made with a truly unique hidden bases mechanic. A shame it never caught on.
346430,Spectrum: First Light,"The great anime promo art drew me in, but unfortunately the gameplay was mind-numbingly boring and needlessly difficult. In addition, the in-game art was extremely lacking, there was no voice acting...Ugh. Not worth $10, and not really worth buying at all."
346440,Musclecar Online,Pretty good for a budget racer. Racing against recordings from other players is pretty cool and it means you're always gonna have a close race.
346450,samurai_jazz,I say three things: This game is HARD! This game is good! and it's well worth of its cost!
346460,Vector 36, Early Access Review
346470,Tennis Elbow 2013,"This is the worst piece of crap I've bought all year. I love tennis, and I'll play the 1999 version of Virtua tennis on my Dreamcast before I will even consider this piece of garbage again..  There isn't really anything good to say about this game, so let's start with the bad.  The graphincs are comparable to an emulated Nintendo 64. That woudln't be a bad thing if the game was made 20 years ago. The music, the color, the everything is like the game came straight out of 1992. The mechanics of the game are gay as hell, you'd simply have to play it to see why. This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on steam and it is so bad, I'm considering revoking the purchase through my credit card and ♥♥♥♥ing my Steam account all together.   OK, so I was a bit drunk when I wrote this review so I went back to try the game out today. My initial review was unfair. Today, I'm going to give this game a 2 out of 10 simply for the fact that it does not require Uplay."
346490,Toy Wars Invasion,"A first person shooter as a toy fighting toys. Survive waves of enemies collecting money from kills. Spend the money between waves in the toybox to buy weapons, ammo and medical supplies. Unlock cars for driving, ramming and shooting. Smooth gameplay.   https://youtu.be/bHasSvep9xo "
34650,Massive Assault Network 2,"Despite what the common sense and other people say about this game, you do not need to be a chess player in order to perform decently on it (Personal experience). But it does share many mechanics that are usually present on chess platforms, but all of those could be personalized, for example, time per turns or not, density of allies, which units could be allowed, and a plethora of customizable options.   The game could seem rather difficult at the beginning, but in fact, it is quite simple if you understand on what the game is founded, territory control, transportation, battle of course and so on. Graphics are undoubtely much more that needed and ultimately gameplay is the reason why after so many years later I still enjoy playing this game (Coming from games like Starcraft2 and so forth).   Definitely recommendable! n.n"
346510,Hyphen,"Getting from one point to another while dodging frustrating obstacles is the premise of the game. It tests your patience in ways you've never known. If you aren't careful, you may end up cursing the world around you due to the frustration that had built up in trying to beat this demonic game. I can see the appeal but ultimately, it isn't for me."
346550,Cylne,"I couldn't get into it. I love puzzle games and I was really excited about this game and how beautiful it looked, but there is no story to it, at least not one that I could discern, and no purpose except to solve the puzzles which you don't know you're doing right or wrong till you get through it. I think it was just too abstract for me personally."
346560,Hero of the Kingdom II,A game that gives quite few fun hours. A bit of frustration when things are hiding from you and you spend a lot of time searching for them but it is satisfying to complete the game 100%.
346610,Racecraft, Early Access Review
346630,Plazma Being,A challenging little puzzle platformer for less than a quid.
346650,Break the Cube,despite the negative feedback this game has i wanted to try this one. doesnt start for me. refunded.
346670,Sky Battles,Awesome game. Lots of cool bosses to destroy with unique abilities. Controller is best but keyboard works too. Can't go wrong for the price.
346730,GOCCO OF WAR,its a good game well but not many player play it...
346770,Quarries of Scred,Like unforgiving retro arcade games? Then you will like this.   Don't like unforgiving retro arcade games? This isn't likely to change your mind.
346780,Luminosity,"A land-grab style game where you use your mouse to shoot lines to bisect the area. If an area has no enemies inside, you claim it. If your line is hit by an enemy before it finishes extending to both ends, you lose a life. You win once you get enough territory (usually ~66%).  Campaign is 36 stages that you can 3-star and you unlock ships for arcade mode by clearing them. Arcade mode is a score attack where you complete levels that increase in difficulty until you run out of lives.  Arcade mode makes more use of the game's offerings than campaign. Unless I missed a mechanic, crystals in campaign are so rare (they only show as a powerup in a few levels and they don't carry over) that the powerup-purchasing part of the game is pointless when you're not in one of those levels. In arcade you can slowly save up across levels so you can stockpile them there.  There are multiple ships to use (you can change ship in arcade but not in campaign) that play a little differently because they mix up line speed, lives, and simple abilities.  There are also ship upgrades that you can spend gold on (but I got no gold for completing the campaign). Ship upgrades are linked to arcade mode (arcade mode gives gold, use gold to upgrade your ship, get farther in arcade mode, higher score means more gold).  The upgrades that are possible are really influential on your high score because they are things like more max lives (up to 10? more, and you start at max lives), chance to gain a life when clearing a stage (up to 50%?), chance to ignore getting hit (up to 30%?), increased laser speed (up to 30%?), and increase power-up spawn rate (up to 50%?). So to really get your high score you'll need to grind thousands of arcade gold through dozens of playthroughs.  Worth a look if you like land-grab games like Fortix 2 or like testing your ability to keep track of enemies and the path your line will take. It can be tough to shoot a line through a sea of enemies that are moving around.  Other thoughts:    There's a bug in campaign: If you spam click as you beat a level then quickly move to the next level, you can start the next level with a free line. Doesn't work when retrying levels, only in campaign mode.    The game doesn't seem to work offline.    When you lose it drags on for a few moments too long. Wouldn't be so bad if you could skip the 'cutscene' of you breaking apart into pieces. It doesn't really matter in arcade mode (because you have multiple lives and clear a lot of levels before each retry) but in campaign mode you might have to repeat the save level multiple times.    I liked the shield ship the most because being able to block enemies approaching your line is incredibly useful.    Seems a lot easier when you can start with a good bisect (instead of slowly and painstakingly shaving away the edges) so I'd spend my first few shots going for something big.    It feels like you need to shoot from the middle so that the lines reach the edges faster (reducing the time you're vulnerable). It would be interesting if half of your line became invulnerable once it hit the wall (so you could lean towards one side and reduce vulnerability time on one side while increasing the other) but that doesn't seem to be the case.  "
346810,Marble Age,"An interesting diversion, but in the end you succeed or fail based on things that aren't really very clear. It doesn't help that the translation is bad. The 'Plague' event seems to be completely glitched out or missing a ton of instructions, because you can do literally everything you're given the option to do and still fail the event, which destroys your chances of succeeding for the rest of the game. Needs work before it is ready to play."
346830,FINAL FANTASY IV: THE AFTER YEARS,"I really like the Final Fantasy series but I'm not enjoying this one. I played it immediately after I finished IV so I've not got that warm nestaglgic glow for it that I might have otherwise. Plus side was that I wasn't getting lost going down the wrong tunnel and I knew where the hidden doors were, but every time you felt you were progressing you'd switch to a new character and start at level 1 so you spend almost the entire game with almost no abilities and it get pretty boring after a while."
346850,Chip's Challenge 1,There are no instructions as to how to make this game go. It's installed and nothing I can do makes anything work. I am now trying to delete this purchase. That doesn't appear to be working either. I don't belong on this site.
346900,AdVenture Capitalist,"The further you get into this game, the less you play it."
346920,Undead Shadows,"Froze upon initial load screen, then I'm looking at a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textured trees. Says 'Push E to Start the Game', so I do so and, for some reason I teleport to a low poly restaurant. That's when I see counter ticking off and realize I'm playing a tower defense game...or something.   Zombies drop money when you kill them. Why? I guess because making money in the usual way that survivl games do things was too complicated. There were a bunch of apples in that restaurant, each worth $100 which you apparently just leave on the shelf for whoever was kind enough to set this one room in a pizza place up with apples.  This game has an identity crisis going on, ♥♥♥♥ graphics, ♥♥♥♥ model animations, and a variety of other issues. Total NOPE. Glad it was in some bundle I bought just for the better games that were in it."
346940,Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition,"Spoiler review    Ate mystery meat, kiled my friends, discussed post-humanism with a psychopath with a robotic lower body, drank mystery wine, had an interview with a vampire, conducted so much corporate espionage and sabotage, saw my foster dad get sucked into an astral plane, made friends with a ghoul ronin, made rats appear on the ground causing mass panic, killed way too many innocent people, stole a super-disease, blew up ALL the cars, raided a museum, banished an eldritich monster, chucked back grenades, betrayed my childhood friend, broke some guy's finger, did some l33t hacking, cut people in 2-3 parts with a giant laser axe, saved Hong Kong from an evil juju machine and punched a god into submission.   What a ♥♥♥♥ing ride that was. Oh my god. I had so much fun."
346950,The Dark Stone from Mebara,At the moment can't even get past library...is it just me?

347160,Steredenn,"Run-1: Blew up astroids, killed everything in my way, and beat the crap out of the first boss Run-2: Got rekt Run-3: Got rekt Run-4: Got rekt Run-5: Beat the second boss and felt badass   Conclusion: 11/10 would get rekt again"
347170,Combat Air Patrol 2, Early Access Review
347230,1942: The Pacific Air War,"I bought this game back in the 90's running on my crapp y little 386 with 4mb raam and 120mb hard disk and (while I was only 13) I thought it was the best damn game ever. The the flight sim was challenging, the combat was interesting and the naval strategy was compelling and quite deep for the simplicity of the interface even though I didn't really know what I was doing. This game got me hooked not just on flight sims but strategy and real world history too.  Now 20 years on I still remember this game and play it now and again because I STILL have not found a modern game that offers as much as this does. Everything else is either really arcadey or is a grand strategy that doesn't incoporate the sim elements.  Protip: If a studio (I could see Gaijin doing well with this) picked this up and modernised it while keeping all the gameplay and sim elements they'd be on to a winner.  P.S. Still the best game ever."
347240,Challenge of the Five Realms,"Okay the reason I gave this game a thumbs down is because I have no nostalgia connected to this game whatsoever so please if you have nostalgia of this game understand that i am playing this in 2015.  This game does not hold up today at all. The pixel art is disgusting and its all so bright it looks like a 3 year old ate a box of crayons and threw up all over the software. The music must be so good only people with ♥♥♥♥ing sonar can hear it because I certainly can't hear it (there is no damn music). Every text box takes the Mayan calenders equivalant amount of time to read because there is so much text in one conversation. This game is bland, unrewarding and overall takes up more time then it should.   I r8 1 commodore64 out of 10"
347250,F-19 Stealth Fighter,"Brings back memories of the original game. No control overlay or play information available, had to look it up and memorize controls. Too bad it wasn't updated with a save game feature. When your character dies that profile is finished and you have to start over.  Can only recommend it when it is on sale."
347260,Hyperspeed,By far one of my favorite DOS games from my youth. I have dumped countless hours into this game in the past and just had to have it when I stumbled upon it on Steam.
347270,Knights of the Sky,nowehere near as good as the amiga version I used to play
347280,A Quiver of Crows,"Just awful.  A ceaseless onslaught of spawning enemies combined with zero hit-detection/feedback and horrible physics, and flunked sound effects and pointless gameplay.  I'd be surprised if you log more than an hour of play before requesting a refund.   $15 dollars for this garbage? A shameless cash grab."
347400,001 Game Creator,I'm sorry to say but I want my money back. GG Maker wasn't the type of software I was looking for and I wish I had read more about it before paying $60. Yet I'm sure that others would benefit from this software but for me it was a waste of time and money. The 'easy to use for all skill levels' interface wasn't that easy for a beginner like me.
347430,Frankenstein: Master of Death,"Pretty ok game.. graphics are ok, nice painted visuals, music is fine. Passable story. Too many 'key' items in the game (feels lazy). While this game is not terrible, there are far better HOGs out there. Overall only play this if you've got time to kill."
347440,Pneuma: Breath of Life,"Probably the best puzzle game I have played, now it wasn't too hard but it was very relaxing and had good puzzles plus a nice satting."
347470,Mayan Death Robots,"A nice game with a nice vision of the devs! I just love to play those fast little games with lots of quality of game play , game graphics &amp; game details! "
347480,Super Pixalo,"There's nothing fun about this game. It's a platformer with horrible controls and a soundtrack that drives you insane. I tried to find something nice about this game. I really did. But there's nothing.  If this game was free, it wouldn't be so bad. But 4 sodding pounds is too much. There's no story, and it tries to tell one. Something about how decades change. It's rubbish.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game. It won't become famous for being bad like Ride to Hell. It won't become famous for being shady like Digital Homicide. It'll just be forgotten, or never remembered "

347690,Natural Soccer,Yes I didn't put much time in but I really didn't want to! I remember old football games being more fun than this. The games also really didn't like me alt-tabbing out.........
347710,Perils of Man,"As fascinated as I was by this game, it's all ended in frustration.  The art style and story seem quite amazing, but a recurring gameplay 'bug' keeps staggering my progress which results me having to restart the game from the very beginning.  After a few hours of this, I've given up. I despair I'll never bother to finish this game, as there's just too much risk of no pay-off.  I'm sorry, but I can't recommend something that won't work. :("
347720,Soda Drinker Pro,t is very cool and artsy.
347730,Wait - Extended,This is really more of a visual novel than anything else. Very low interactivity.
347790,Terraform,"Somewhat interesting puzzle game. As far as I got it wasn't really a challenge, but the learning curve is very flat, so it might get challenging once more concepts are introduced.   Unfortunately, it's not available on Linux. On windows (10), it first didn't let me change to full screen or change the resolution, then when I restarted the game wouldn't start. Definitely not recommended."
347820,Street Arena,"Enjoyable game for fans of old school GTA. A lot of destruction, kicking ♥♥♥ and chaos everywhere. At the beginning it's difficult to control your character but you can learn it easily."
347830,Fairy Fencer F,Good Gameplay Good Art Good Music  Good Characters Good Voice Acting Good Story  But has the worst ending I've seen since the end of Chaika the Coffin Princess.  Proceed with caution
347930,Hatland Adventures,It's a great game Kappa
347940,Forsaken Isle, Early Access Review
3480,Peggle Deluxe,"Peggle Deluxe is a classic addictive time waster. The game is simple. Shoot a ball and aim for the orange circles (or pegs) to clear the level. Except it's somewhat hard to predict as to where the ball will bounce, so there's a lot of luck but also trial and error involved. The campaign is around 6 hours long, but there is also a challenge mode which you can unlock afterwards which can last you many hours (around 6-8+ depending on your luck!)"
34800,Chronicles of Mystery: The Scorpio Ritual,"The puzzles are either easy or annoying. Not hard, just annoying. The plot is not too heavily invested in, and feels more like the game is 'plot-flavored' rather than having an actual plot. The end provides no explanations or any sense of closure. Nothing becomes much clear than comparing to the first 30 minutes of game play. In addition, there are severe speech-bugs, and most conversations stop in mid-sentence. I'm afraid this is a definate 'No'."
348000,Datswer,"This game is similar to Another World, a platformer exploration game with sudden deaths.  The main problem with this game is the buggy platforming. Sometimes you can jump into an object and get stuck. If you cancel a climb animation while hanging on an edge, you will get stuck. These will force you to load the last save point."
348030,Trackday Manager,it sux beacose it sloppy and no action it sux
34810,Project Freedom,"Great simple shooting and maneuvering fun! It's 74 cents right now, BUY IT!"
348180,Starship Traveller,"I've just come from playing 'Forest of Doom' and thought I'd finally get round to playing this one by comparison as it's one of the few sci-fi books in the series, and actually the very first they ever did.  It was written by an outsider, and it shows. The tone is completely different, and whilst it has the standard Skill/Stamina/Luck attributes, there's some other stuff going on too. It's also short. Very short. A standard FF gamebook had 400 'paragraphs' and this only had 340.  The 'correct' path through the game involves skipping over huge chunks, whizzing past most of the planets, and only actually landing on three of them. And at one point you have to just keep rolling dice randomly in the hope that the RNG lets you out of a maze. You don't even get to choose which way to go - it's all decided by the roll of the dice. And you HAVE to go that way, so it's possible to fail entirely by luck, even if you know exactly what decisions to make.  It's also possible to win without having a single battle, whether hand-to-hand or ship-to-ship, which makes the 'Fighting' part of the title somewhat tenuous.  However, I did like the somewhat dark sense of humour that has been injected throughout. First of all, the game says 'Using advanced technology, the console will determine your base values'...followed by a pair of dice being rolled. And when a crew member died, you're given a button to click to mourn them...  Tinman have done their best to dress up the game with exciting music and a fun interface, but it's all for naught. You can choose the name and gender of yourself, and also do the same to your crew if you like...even naming the ship's cat...but it doesn't make the slightest bit of difference to the story. It also crashed a few times when I was playing it."
34820,Combat Wings: Battle of Britain,"Bought it for 49 cents.  It's not as 'advanced' as WT,it's arcade-ish. But yeah,it's good."
348200,Nimble Writer,"I really, really wanted to like this software. Dealing with the bloated leviathan that is Word has been a chore, but at least it can properly handle formatting. Trying to import my Docx results in the Nimble herding all of my work's indentions, and spacing at gunpoint into a train cart to never be heard from again. Its a huge block of text when you do get it to squirt onto the screen. Please, fix the Word importer's formatting. I really want to be a happy customer."
348240,Gun Wings,This game is harder than demon souls. I died 44 times in 5 minutes. 10/10. (and I wasn't even on nightmare difficulty lol.)
348250,Google Earth VR,"Dear jewgle, why is there no oculus support? My son (Rex) wanted to play so bad and it turns out, theres no oculus support, and instead you're trying to force us to buy some garbage, overpriced oculus with two wii remotes. You should be ashamed. This is truly the end of PC gaming."
348270,Social Justice Warriors,"It is incredible. Take on the role of Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr or ♥♥♥♥♥ to fight against the trolls of the internet."
348280,ORBIT,It got bored when started to won every single game we did with friends but its still really good game!
348290,Hospital Manager,I bought this game because I loved Theme Hospital back in the day and was looking for a modern version of the game and quite frankly this is not it. This is just a wanabe oversimplifed copy of it. So if you're looking to buy it for the same reason I was then I suggest you instal the HD textures for Theme hospital instead and keep playing it because its much better then this game.
3483,Peggle Extreme,And that's why you don't call a casual game a 'not extreme enough' game
34830,Sniper: Ghost Warrior,Boring locations and extremely hard controlling in missions without sniper. AI stupid like a donkey.
348300,Chip's Challenge 2,"A game made by sadists, for masochists.  If you like what made Chip's Challenge 1 so enticing, then you'll like this game for more of the same. The sequel adds many new items/blocks/enemies to keep things flavored differently from the first game.  The game is riddled with bait-and-switches, red herrings, and generally unfair levels. If you don't enjoy being frustrated, this game is not for you."
348340,Siege Wars,"I received a coupon for this game and decided to try it out.   For $1, it's not too bad. There are a lot of reviews saying this game is a clone of Angry Birds; to an extent, they are pretty similar. The mechanic that makes this game stand out is that the targets are able to attack you.  If you've played slingshot-style games, it's a familiar setting with different graphics.  My few criticisms of the game would be the Ice world, and lack of controller compatiability.  My beef with Ice world is that the dotted projectile path is much harder to see, compared to any other world. Games like Angry Birds could get away with something like that because the projectiles pull 180 degrees away from where you want to go; you can't tell what direction you're launching projectiles in Siege Wars.  Controller compatiability wouldn't be game-making, but I think it would complement the playstyle very well. The projectile style for Siege Wars ironically opposite of another projectile-style game - Castlestorm. In Castlestorm, projectiles are much more effective with mouse, due to point-and-click behavior, making controller support less efficient. In Siege Wars, wth the lack of point-and-click behavior, controller joysticks would be a perfect option. "
348360,Doodle God,  i used to love playing this on my ipod back in the day. it's pretty much no different here.
348380,The Interview,"Interesting experiment, but it feels like it needs a little more polish overall. The concept is really interesting, leaving you with many questions; but at times I feel like it bombards you with too many questions, assailing you with dozens of overlapping themes. Maybe if it were longer, 30 minutes at least, The Interview would succeed more at what it is trying to accomplish. There is potential here but definitely a lot of unused potential. I am looking forward to what this developer puts out next.  5.5/10 - Average/Good"
348400,BattleLore: Command,"I came back to this game after a few months off from playing. G1ul10 is correct.   A few key points for new players or old RTS players that might throw you a bit in this game:  1. You are facing a scenario in the campaign mode of being overwhelmed.  2. As a consiquence of 1. you're always struggling to complete OBJECTIVES rather than clear the field.  3. The situation of 1 &amp; 2 really plays in such a way that you begin to process what a gable a real to life tactical situation actually is. If you're coming into this with the mindset of a Total War game you've going to get crushed. 4. This is game of building momentums, sudden losses, and a firm willingness to sacrifice a units towards the greater goal. If you're Captain Kirk and can't accept a no-win scenario this game could definitely rub you the wrong way.   Overall the game is much like the boardgame. I agree with G1ul10. My only recommendation for the developer is to allow us to design our own maps in the future such as a we can do in the Board Game. This would greatly improve everything about it and render even this more positive review inadiquate of the game's potential and satisfaction."
348430,Quell Reflect,too simple 6/10. free Berusky is more better
348440,Quell Memento,I don't think the story parts were needed but this is still the best version of the quell series. Great game!
348450,Lex Mortis,"+ Good Graphic  - NO GAMEPLAY - NO UPDATES  It feels like a 'graphical test game'. Don't buy this game, buy a pizza ;)"
348460,Bierzerkers,"I am excited to see what may happen with this game. As of now, I would say it is definitely an alpha state project. The game looks goreous, and there is obvious potential.   I feel compelled to point out a few things.   1. There is no controller support. (Made a more than adequate steam controller profile, however) 2. Single player mode is.... lacking content. Would love a story mode here, or more cut scenes/plot. 3. So far as i can tell, you can only train with a single character, a situation that would love a remedy, imho.  I have a definite aversion to early access games, the possiblity that the game will never be finished has always prevented me from taking the plunge.  I did here because that game looks so damn cool. I tend to be a single player game sort of gamer, so I am kleeping my fingers crossed that they will hold up their end of the unspoken social contract and finish the game. As is currently stands I am not sure it is fair to a consumer to have a 'single player' tag associated with the game... or the 'partial controller support tag.  I am cheering you on, dev team.  Update 08/2026  They promised single player, and did not deliver. This is why I am hesitant about early access. There is nothing in the original trailer that is actually in the game. After they have your money, there is no need for the dev's to keep their promises."
348470,SAMURAI WARRIORS 4-II,I swear dis is best game if u like play Hack and Slash. Cz im old player SW in ps 2 rofl :D
348490,Beyond Sol,"I was excited about this at first, seemed to have a lot of potential. But as the game was devoloped and there didn't seem to be added more features or content I was kinda dissapointed."
348510,Autobahn Police Simulator,I rather just go and work in real life as an cop to play this game ever again in my life
348540,Divine Slice of Life,"fun, but not worth full price."
348550,GUILTY GEAR XX ACCENT CORE PLUS R,wow what a ♥♥♥♥ing surprise another indie game...... who's psyched I'm not  UPDATE: APPARENTLY I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT THIS INDIE DEV JUST PUT OUT A GAME THAT WAS MADE OVER A DECADE AGO. WOW!!! NOW INDIE DEVS AREN'T EVEN TRYING ANYMORE!! THEY'RE JUST GOING TO START TO REHASH OLD PROJECTS JUST TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK!!!!  ~$$ DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY $$~
348620,Voices from the Sea,"Its a pretty short casual visual novel, which took me around 70 mins to finish (probably could've been 30 if I wasn't distracted my my friend messaging me...). It a sweet story of how to find the true value of things. However, it felt more like an intro even though I know it was finished. I wouldn't say it was one of the best visual novel but more casual, and with how short it is there is nothing stopping you from not reading it."
348650,The Asskickers,"Quite boring and clunky. The auto-grapple mechanics make it so that if you touch an enemy, you are stuck with him until he dies or you get hit, which is most of the time. Then, you are stuck in a stun-lock and die. No throwing or breaking out of the grapple.  The enemies try to kite you, which sucks. Moving around is a chore and if you try to turn around to hit someone behind you, a rangeless backpunch is all you get (then you get grabbed from behind and pretty much die).  Don't but this."
348670,Immune,"  Honestly, i dont like it. It is really dull, not many visual aspects, system requirements are high for those kind of graphics, the servers are dead and not much character customization. I really d'ont know how i got this. I just found it today in my library saying i payed for it 3 months ago, and my balance stayed the same."
34870,Sniper Ghost Warrior 2,"I have played the whole singleplayer campaign on casual and have thoroughly enjoyed it. The singleplayer is split into three parts called acts the first act is set a couple of months/weeks ago the second is in 1993 and the third in the current day. Through the first act you and your partner 'Diaz' are picking off men and guiding your soldiers through enemy territory. The second act you and your partner Gomez do the same sort of thing (later theres a twist), in the third act 'Diaz' is back and you take down a double-crosser in an amazing finish.  The games graphics are better then average considering it came out in 2013. It has a more then decent story and even on casual difficulty its certainly isn't a walk in the park. The animations are farely good but you won't get to see many of them in the demo (which I recommend playing before purchasing the full game). There are barely any cutscenes in the first act but in the third act they take up easily 30% of the gameplay.   There are a number of negatives but most people over exaggerate on how bad they are. For example if you are walking through a forest path you might get stuck on an invisable object for a second. One thing i found interesting was in different scenes 'Diaz' was voiced by different people. Last issue I have is that they didn't sync the character's mouth animations with the words they were saying which looks odd.   I haven't played the multiplayer much at all and I'm not a big fan of what I played but I never had high expectations for it. I suggest playing the demo before purchasing it. Now the price; I bought this through the Sniper Ghost Trilogy pack for $2.99 US at the christmas sale (without sale it is priced at $19.99 US). I don't recommend that package because the older Sniper Ghost games aren't nearly as good as this one and plus the new one is coming out this year. By its self this game costs $9.99 US which might be a little pricey but if its on sale its a great pick up (it will probably go on sale soon because of Sniper Ghost: Warrior 3 coming this year). I want to point out that its not a complete copy of sniper elite thats a little worst for a cheaper price. I think people got this idea because of the slow-motion bullet cam that are very similar in both games. The system requirements definitely aren't crazy considering you don't even need a single gb of ram to run it.   A tip of advise, when following Diaz or Gomez to dodge enemies they might walk into an area where you would think they would get spotted. Don't then take another path around the area because it looks safer because you will get spotted somehow so just always follow them whereever they go in those parts of the missions.  Lastly the singleplayer will last you a few hours with the great highlights and the multiplayer is average. I was disappointed that it only took about four hours to finish singleplayer I really wanted to continue playing more missions (e.g. don't expect plenty of hours of gameplay). I rate it 8/10, I would of rated it higher if there were less bugs and glitchs but I rated it this high because it keeps you on your toes the whole time."

348860,MyDream, Early Access Review
348870,Night Mysteries: The Amphora Prisoner,"Too short, confusing at times and so not worth it"
348950,Ame no Marginal -Rain Marginal-,"While I wouldn't say it was as good as its predecessor novel (Narcissu), Ame no Marginal was a nice, short story with believable characters, an interesting plot, and a highly satisfying conclusion. Most importantly, however, the novel managed to tell two different, distinct (yet obviously not wholly unrelated) stories concurrently without ever running into an issue of pacing. Each arc felt to be a suitable length for the point it was trying to make, and the game was very good about ensuring you had read all background necessary before moving on so as to ensure that none of the references would be missed.  That said, despite how nice of a VN it was, it was only a 4-5 hr read at a leisurely pace. I couldn't recommend it at the full $13 Steam price. Get it when it's 50-70% off and it'll be worth your while."
348960,Odysseus: Long Way Home,"I'm sorry, but as a user of a 1680x1050 screen, I can't recommend this game. I am either forced to play the game full-screen with a huge black border on the right side that pushes the rest of the game outside of the screen, or in a small window, the size of which is  entirely uncustomizable  (why???), so all the hard work the dev's put into the art is at least 1/3 lost. Playing HOG's without being able to enjoy the art is pointless as far as I am concerned.  I also play HO games on my own terms, i.e. super casually, as I don't have much patience for them (genuine ADHD and all), so it's pretty infuriating playing minigames you really don't enjoy in  any  context and seeing the SKIP bar filling up so damn slowly.   I can't see myself enjoying this, sorry.  "
348980,INIT.,"The graphics arew bad, The controls are bad and the only thing i enjoyed about this game was closing it"
3490,Venice,I have played this game for quite a while and all of a sudden it decides to slowly jerk to where i cannot play it any more . I enjoy the mindless game but am now not so impressed with it.
34900,Bad Rats,  10/10 masterpeice. This game cured my cancer and saved a starving child in Africa. Would not recommend.
349020,Hyperspace Pinball,"Picked up for a dollar which I thought was value. The problem with this game is the effects. The explosions are so bright you lose all track of the ball. Consequently you lose it. This is the reason there are no side drains. It would be impossible. When enemies move to an area on top of the drain, it's pretty obvious where the ball is going to go when it hits one. Ah yes, the throw back. If you lose the ball (and sometimes when it feels like you might have when it hits an enemy and moves faster than the speed of light) the ball is thrown back with some equally bizarre lighting effect. Next time it's game over. In my day, pinball involved 5 balls. Whats with this one bonus throw back insta kill? Even Asteroids gave you three chances and an opportunity to win an extra turn. Yes, I know the levels are pretty simple but it makes you feel ripped off. The rebounds from the enemies, which should be the same as the kicker rebound if you think about pinball and pop bumpers, coupled with the explosion graphics is way over the top.  The tables really are woeful. There should be much more than 4 flippers &amp; 2 kickeres. The bottom flippers just don't feel 'right'. On the Endurance round, the 2 additions at the top just aren't enough to make it interesting.  With all that wasted space on the sides, why wasn't this made as a wide bodied pinball like Genie with a large central area for fighting and smaller sub areas for single attack aliens or like Black Hole where the lower playfield could have been the alien encounter ? If this could have been massively expanded to the likes of 'Pinball World' with a centralised Alien control centre it would have been briliant. Now, there's an idea just waiting to happen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They had the right idea but the implementation just failed dismally. "
349040,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4,"The story mode on Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is very good, it shows clips from the anime show which allows you to understand better. The overall fighting on this game is far better than most games out there.   The story mode however will spoil the anime if you are currently watching it.   If you are a Naruto fan then i recommend this game due its complex animations and the multiple secret interactions. If you have a friend who also has the game, multiplayer can be very fun, this is because you can duel your friends and show them who is the better shinobi."
349060,Fruits Inc. Deluxe Pack,"Its a fun grow fruit game where you make juice, pies, and jam according to the level challenges. The story is simple. You get upgrades to help you."

34920,Razor2: Hidden Skies,"Where do I begin?   Pro: The Title Art looks cool  Steam refund  Choice not to buy even for the $0.99 I paid.  Cons: Poor Graphics (Think hi res PS1)  Poor optmization, bad frame rate   Choopy animations  Poor gameplay. First level feels like doing the exact same thing for 2 minutes up to the boss  Buggy, game crashed hardcore.  This is a cash grab that feels like a flash game that lost 80% of it's budget  Not enjoayble or easy on the eyes   "

349260,BlastZone 2,Got this on sale on a whime since i like bullet hells and this was fun! Great job!  Pros: Online co-op Quick levels Different ship types that vary Annoying enemies Can see the bullets when comes at you   Cons: Network lag with online co-op (random) host doesnt get affect team mate does The enemies in the bg are hard to read (hard to tell if there foreground or bg) The Gui gets in the way ov the bottom enemies and bullet spreads  Suggestions: If the gui was more compacted and had display which icon was next to those stats that it affected. Ship hit box a bit tighter  Overall a fun quick game if u like bullet hells

349450,Dark Forester, Early Access Review
349460,Lord of the Dark Castle,"Basic, conventional roguelike. Even as someone who has played a lot of roguelikes, I find this frustrating. There are plenty of annoying status effects to endure, and your equipment can easily be destroyed or stolen, and luck generally plays a big part of things. For a few bucks more I'd recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal instead, or even Battlepath for someone inexperienced with roguelikes."
349500,Cubicle Quest,One of the best games I've ever played..
349530,TableTop Cricket,"This is a beatiful arcade style cricket game so plese do not expect any kind of simulation , and because of Work for DBC 2014 done by developers i was curious to try out this game and finally bought this today . Fast 5 format is real fun , specially you are playing with your brothers or relative in 2nd player mode :)  I would say this as the best arcade style cricket game ever though my favroite cricket game so far is DBC 2014, waiting for next version :)"
349540,PeriAreion,"I was an early supporter and noticed a new patch, but when I reinstalled the game and the 'colonist' kept shouting 'ORDERS CONFIRMED' every time I clicked for him to walk, I thought back to 1996 and realized ths game is rubbish. Enough other people have listed the negatives (besides the horrible graphics), I'll just leave with this thought. It's 2015. this game doesn't belong on Steam. Don't waste your money.  It was bunk in 2015 it's still bunk end of September 2016"
349550,Mighty Dungeons,"From what I'm given to understand this is a single developer's sonata to the age old classic game HeroQuest. I played it as a kid and probably still have the board/pieces in storage. This makes this game NOSTALGIC and the developer is evil for cashing in on my nostalgia (just kidding, I love you?). That being said the game is simple and easy to pick up. There isn't much thought required beyond simple math.  PRO's: Easy to learn and fun to play Lots of variety available Interesting classes and campaigns Basically a PC graphic for a boardgame in a very well done format  CON's: Imbalanced Classes Imbalanced shop (weapons/armor/etc)  I have heard that the developer is still actively working with the community on this game and still creating more content. For me that is a HUGE plus! Props to you good sir!  Definitely worth a go if you remember HeroQuest or if you like rpg type boardgames!"
349580,Burstfire,"My apologies for the short review, but there is nothing to say. The game is completely empty and abandoned!"
349650,Tokyo Hosto,This is one bad game. I could not make it work under Steam and had to play externally (so ignore my Steam time shown). Took effort to make it rack up enough time on failed starts in order to be able to write this review to warn others. Please do not buy this game. Read the other reviews.
349680,Supercharged Robot VULKAISER,"What you see is what you get. It's a five dollar indie bullet hell shmup based off of fighting robot animes. If all of those things tick your box, pick it up."

349760,Snail Bob 2,Had a great time playing Snail Bob 2. Really enjoyed playing through and trying to find all the hidden puzzle pieces and putting them together. My 4 year old daughter also had a great time.   you can see my full review at:  http://www.confidentgamers.com/snail-bob-2-review/ 
349780,Fatty Maze's Adventures,I really would like being able to recommend a game like this. But there is all the small UI and technical stuff that gets in the way. Basically ruining my gaming experience. You might not experience it the same way. But I found it too annoying.  My biggest complains are not being able to play in a window. And then there's the controls. Far from a smooth feeling. But looking away from that. Sometime the character would turn in a direction without me telling him to. I could ignore that if you could just point and click where you would want him to go. But in that case he only move 1 block in the direction clicked. Meaning you have to click a LOT.
349840,Ancestory,"Pro: (+) Easy achievement, despite time-consuming grindfest  Cons: (-) Limited card pool (-) Shallow gameplay depth (-) Lack of contents (-) Framerate issue (I'm using GTX 960M 4GB) (-) Sound issue (-) Unoptimized (from graphic setting to RAM consumption) (-) Crash occasionally "
349950,GunWorld,        YouTube™ Video:  Steam Cleaning - GunWorld&nbsp;
3500,Mystery P.I.: The Lottery Ticket,A nice simple hidden object game. There are some simple puzzle games in between but mostly it's hidden object scenes. Good game to pass some mindless time on.
35000,Mini Ninjas,Game runs really rough and there is no sound during gameplay only during scenes.
350000,Exostorm,Great action for anyone reminiscent of the 1990s shareware titles of the same genre.
350010,Time Mysteries: Inheritance - Remastered,"This one sits on the poorer side of average and is not what we've come to expect of Artifex Mundi. The story is OK but the graphics are below the usual standard and use a bizarre mathod of facial distortion when characters are talking. It's very odd indeed. The voice acting is ordinary, too. Perhaps this is an older title that shows where they've come from or it may be another company's work but there are much better options around. It's OK to pass the time for a couple of hours but don't expect the usual AM quality here. 4/10."
350020,The Gate,"Servers are down, game is dead."
350070,Environmental Station Alpha,"1. Take classic Nintendo Entertainment System title 'Metroid' 2. Remove the incredible soundtrack, clever powerups, eerie atmosphere, nonlinear gameplay and sense of depth - in other words, everything that made Metroid a genre-defining classic. 3. Add in the same cookie-cutter pixel art style that every mediocre indie project uses to get sales by preying on those nostalgic for a time when games held greater meaning than 'those things people churn out in Game Maker over a four-day weekend for an easy buck.' 4. You now have Environmental Station Alpha."
350080,Wolfenstein: The Old Blood ,"I really enjoyed the game and the story line. The only thing I would add is the abilty to drap bodies so you can hide them from the other patrolls. If you make me sit through credits, put something cool to look at or give a extra short story line video at the end."
350090,No Pineapple Left Behind,"This game is really brilliant in its approach to commenting on high stakes testing in schools. Sadly, the fun and even some of the message are lost in an overly-complex game design that requires constant micro-managing of teachers and even individual students; for this reason, I didn't even play beyond the first couple of schools because each one became bigger, and the prospect of constantly pausing to zoom in and use an action on a specific student was too daunting to keep playing. Of course, even that's part of the message; it's hard to design curriculum around individual students, why not just turn them into pineapples?!"
350110,TransOcean 2: Rivals,You are basically paying for a loading screen and that's it for £20. Got it in the sale for £10 but still not worth it and therefore has been refunded. I loved Transocean: The Shipping Company but this game game just falls way short. My computer exceeds the recommended system requirements. Until they fix this problem I will not have any plans of re buying this game.
350150,Scraps: Modular Vehicle Combat, Early Access Review
350210,Mighty Switch Force! Academy,If you liked the outer gaming in the Mighty Switch Force! series then if this is on sale for a good price you should pick it up. You and friends could have fun together also. The biggest downside is it is very short only 26 levels but there are timed objectives and leader boads to strive for the best run.
35030,Championship Manager 2010,"Seriously disappointing game that I really, really, really tried to like, but failed. Let me see - I have at least 1 injury in each game. sometimes even 4 or 5 in one game, the transfer negotiations are rather poor, not to mention often at the end of long negotiations I'm finally informed... that player is not interested. Match engine has some gliches and overall is unrealistic - players with plenty of space to dribble try hopless long shots, etc.  It is cheap, but at the same time really poor."
350310,BLADESTORM: Nightmare,Does not play like dynasty or samurai warriors... was very very disappointed
350330,Call of the Ninja!,"Really needs to give the player a little time to work before the ninjas start running...some levels are impossible to save all the ninjas because it starts immediately after the first icon is placed. Black cracks in the graphics due to not enough masking pixels on the edges of the sprites. I loved Lemmings, think I played all the way through it way back when. I'd really like to recommend this as it's similar and I like the ninja theme. Right now it's a bit too frustrating. A few little fixes and this could be great! Thumb sideways?!"
350380,The Martian VR Experience,"Should be a free 'demo' honestly. Not much to this 'experience.' Just another over-sensualized product that FOX is trying to make every penny from. SO many cinematics! Not nearly enough interaction. This could be a great thing, so I hope someone out there can appreciate detail like this, but actually make something worth while.  That said, the design was the game's best quality."
350490,Love And Order,An older WinterWolves title. While it isn't as streamlined as new games its still quite good. The mystery plot is quite linear and super easy to playthrough. All in all its pretty good.
350500,Fly in the House,This game should be more like $2...I had ot stop playing after 5 minutes because i got motion sickness from it.
350530,Airport Firefighters - The Simulation,It's not a simulation and it's not very fun.
350550,Area-X,"I loved this game. The graphics are great, the story and mystery and unfolding myster are incredibly engaging, and the music offers a nice compliment. Definitely one of my favorites, and well worth the money. Looking forward to another play through to find the endings I've missed."

350610,Combat Cats,Nice puzzle game featuring cats. It's ok.
350620,Sandmason,this game is dreadful. buy at your own risk.. 
350630,Dodge,Just a really simple game where you have to dodge incoming cubes and lines. Nothing too special to recommend.
350640,Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,"I want to like this game, I really do. I enjoy detective games with good stories (and you'll get some of that here) but this one comes with clunky controls which make me grit my teeth. I enjoy figuring out puzzles, but there are a TON of puzzles thrown in here as filler that don't contribute to the plot. Did we really need an Indiana Jones aztec puzzle segment? Or a strange fever dream sequence at the end to contribute to the meta plot development? Maybe not...  If you enjoyed the previous games, you'll get more of the same. But also more of the same frustrations."
350660,Alganon,"Changed review from positive to negative after I didn't play for a month or two, all characters I had created including the things I had Paid real money for, were not there. It had potential, but it failed."
35070,Flora's Fruit Farm,No because no
350700,Red Stone Online,played this game since it was owned by OGPlanet. its a game that i can play without getting bored of it
350740,The Bug Butcher,"One of the most addictive games I'v ever played on Steam, it's like PANG on asteroids, ultra fast paced gameplay, all the retro arcade feeling with awesome graphics, good music, this game has it all. super sImple controls, I have played for the first time straight to level 20. quite difficult but not extreme.  only a few things missing for me: - I use arcade controls on my arade cabibet, so it would be nice not having to use the 'return' key, so the 'fire' key should be also used as 'retrun key´so no keybord should be needed. - also it would be way cooler if the levels were random generated, so no enemy patterns memorized and so. - I'd would had love it even more if the graphics were pixelated, thoug the 2D/3D comic style is well done. nice animations. - possibility of setting the music/fx volume indpendetly  super recommended game "
350770,Giana Sisters 2D,"Some background: I never played the original version of this game, but I absolutely loved Twisted Dreams and Rise of the Owlverlord. So I'm disappointed to say that this game is just a bad Mario clone. I don't mean that it's a game that fails to emulate Mario; I mean it's a game that emulates the formula of Mario perfectly but is so much worse."
350780,MANOS: The Hands of Fate ~ Director's Cut,"this game is a p funny parody of a particular NES subgenre, namely really bad platformers based on popular films (see the beetlejuice NES game, for example, though pretty much every NES game based on a film was pretty bad and often unplayable tbh) - a phenomenon you might be familiar with if not through personal experience then by having watched the angry video game nerd or a similar reviewer. the big difference between the games MANOS: the hands of fate parodies and the game itself is that MANOS is actually playable, while maintaining the feel if a glitchy weird-♥♥♥ platformer based on an intellectual property that really shouldn't be a platformer at all, and maintaining a believable NES aesthetic (compared to, say, shovel knight, a game that would've never been released for the NES). while many of the challenges presented to you by the game might feel insurmountable if you just run into them, it's all really just about observing patterns. this is kind of like what those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NES games wanted to be, i guess? definitely worth the purchase if you enjoy NES homages - it's also the first game i've run across that's paying homage to the part of the 8 bit era people would rather forget, which i think is kind of funny."
350800,Cannibal, Early Access Review
350810,Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime,"Overall the game is good but features like the annoying ♥♥♥ fairy, the same music being looped and very ugly peices that hurts your brain to look at/solve makes the game terrible. This game should not cost more than $5 but funny enough it's nearly $10. Not worth it, just buy DLC for the other Pixel Puzzle games."
350840,Bonetown - The Power of Death,"I agree with a lot of the negative things that have been said about this game in the reviews and in the forums but I do not agree that they add up to a bad game. I initially found a lot of the controls and accessing and using menu options oddly configured, but nothing all that hard to adjust to and I don’t even remember what most of the issues were. Inventory and graphics options work fine but it did take me a couple of minutes to figure it out.  I agree that the A &amp; D movement keys do not work as advertised – a double tap will give you a roll to the left and right but I couldn’t see any discernable movement just holding them down. But I also never found any place where it mattered to the gameplay. Circle strafing not required in combat!  At the default graphics settings the game played horribly on my rig. After I adjusted the settings the game still looked really good and played fine EXCEPT 1) in Runetown, near the water, when there are a lot of NPCs around, during a thunderstorm and 2) a timed run through some caverns with combat and ledges to fall off and a companion to keep alive who was suicidal and not much good in a fight. Better framerates would be an improvement obviously but the game runs fine as is.  This is a huge world with very nice graphics and a lot of places to discover and many, many quests to complete. Unlike a lot of other games, including ones that are reviewed very favorably, there are very few invisible walls that restrict your movement. The boundaries are almost always real world objects like mountains or walls. If it looks like you should be able to reach something, you can. It might be pointless at times but I like to explore thoroughly rather than just following roads or waiting for the next quest icon to appear at the top of the screen. Sometimes you find stuff. Sometimes you struggle to get to the top of an almost impossible to reach mountain peak and your only reward is some clipping because the game creators got a little careless since most people would have taken the hint and given up.  The only thing I do not like about the game is the puzzles. Either they suck or I suck at puzzles. Either way, too much of my playing time was spent solving them. Many I solved through trial and error and once I figured them out, I would look back at the clue and still have no idea how it should have helped me solve it.  But some time in the next few days I will paste my notes into a game guide. It won’t be anything pretty but at least you’ll have some solutions if you don’t have the intelligence (spelled p a t i e n c e) to solve them on your own.  There were also a few glitches or poor design decisions.  At the beginning of the game, I did everything I could find in Bonetown and there were all these inaccessible doors and I thought it was a really short and crappy game. But retraced my steps looking for something I might have missed and eventually went back inside the house where the game starts and when I exited there was a quest activated. No idea if this was a glitch or planned that way but either way, guessing some people would have just quit which is unfortunate.  And in the Ghetel and on Rune Island, I had to save the game and reload it in order to activate events that you needed to complete the quest/location.  I’ll spell things out more in the guide.  Also worth noting that at about 70% completion, credits rolled which normally indicates the end of the game. But you can keep playing. Currently I am stuck at 78% completion because I can’t figure out the latest in the series of never-ending puzzles. But I’ll add it to the guide when I do figure it out!  To sum up. A flawed game with some questionable design decisions but which is still a lot of fun to play. "
350910,Streets of Fury EX,no one is joking it really is good
350970,Planet of the Eyes,Not very long but very entertaining platformer for casual playing  Nice graphics  Logical puzles  7/10
350990,Bloodwood Reload,"I finished the game thanks to Deep_wolf with their short guide. You'll find it in the discussions section, no actual guide as of yet.   I wouldn't recommend playing straight away. But if you want to see for yourself what this game holds.. I'm not stopping you. This game has numerous 'problems', as we've all read in the comments and frankly the only good thing it has is graphics.   What I would like to see more in the future is: +A bigger and longer storyline, with more characters and areas to be accessable. ((Like that door upstairs in the Inn..) Maybe even a few more side/subquests.) +Obviously all the technical issues with the bugs and such, to be fixed. +For the english version to make sense... (I'm willing to help out with that.. ) +Possibly voice actors in the future? +Puzzles to unlock certain things, not rooms as such but like locked chests or trinquets.  +Achievements? (In-game trophies even?) ... Maybe..."
3510,Amazing Adventures: The Lost Tomb,"*sigh*  Alright. Hidden Object Game Number 7 I played through.  Flavor of story of this game: You're looking for a lost tomb in Egypt. That's where you'll be all of the game long. 21 locations, 20 Missions split into different levels, endless hidden object level after finding all scarabs (one for every location).  That's it. Nothing more to the game.  I'm done. I need... I need something mindlessly funny. Preferrably with over the top guns and one-liners."
351030,Pixel Puzzles Ultimate,"&gt;300 pieces, are you kidding me lol i got headache after play this"
351050,Cricket Captain 2015,"I bought this randomly a couple of years ago, and decided to give it a crack just recently. I have to say I am genuinely surprised at the quality of the game. There is many hours of gameplay, with three different league systems. The graphics, though repetitive in both play and commentary, are still very good.   Recommended for any cricket fan, but perhaps go far the newer versions as they have more leagues.  NOTE: You don't play the game, your more like a desicion maker (Football Manager Style)."
351060,Outpost 13,"Hm, at the beginning it was a promising game...  If you know how the game works, you play 5 minutes to get to the end of act I (I think I got there, but I am not sure, because credits were shown without letting me know if I failed or not). It's the same with the whole game: it doesn't tell me if I did do correct or not.  I think I had a couple of bugs, but actually I was not sure if these were bugs. It could have been also the game that changed its mechanics, the way I would get to the solution or something.  Anyways, this 'Outpost 13' should not cost anything, because it is a demo. I don't know what the developer/pubishler thought... but I guess they didn't intentionally want to frustrate and disappoint their customers. But who knows?  To summarize:  This review that I wrote has more content than the game itself and it consumed more time than actually playing through this demoversion.  I am sad. Lots of potential given away and I hope for better... I will have for sure a look on Act II when it's out.  ciao.  "
351080,The Corporate Machine,"Game crashed almost immediately upon playing. Many of the buttons in the game appear to not work, or their clickbox is misplaced."
351090,Regency Solitaire,"I gotta say, I was kinda dissapointed to see I got this as a bonus game in my Humble Bundle but I still tried.  It's quite a simplistic card game with so-so graphics, annoying music and an apparently awful sexist story (at least in the beginning, but spoil away I don't intend to finish the campaign).  All in all, another awful game I'll never launch again. At least I got cards and Lethal League..."
351100,Niffelheim, Early Access Review
351140,Rustbucket Rumble,"Really casual and fun game, but there's usually no one playing. I've put a 'recommend' on this in hopes of more players picking it up, but it's nigh impossible to play in the current community state."
351150,DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon,unique graphic but it is indeed not satisfying.  the dragon isn't even feels like a dragon this game is more like ' A Game About an old man '
351170,Pixel: ru², Early Access Review
351230,Counter Spell,surprisingly fun and somewhat challenging. play with friends
351250,Avalanche 2: Super Avalanche,"Toast you're marshmallow! Avalanche 2 is a 'rougelite' platformer wherein you are climbing a vertical tower of blocks which continually fall from the sky and avoiding both enemy attacks and falling blocks. The controls feel quite sluggish until you get a few powerups but once you do it handles beautifully. I really like this game.  Good - lots of replayability - nice and tight, game feels good to play -nice art and music -2 player mode is dope  Bad -If you lose your cape you're boned  - hard game  This game is really good, great concept, well executed. A few more powerups would be good but overall there isn't much I would want to change. 5/5 a must for bite size platform fans"
351290,SURVIVAL: Postapocalypse Now, Early Access Review
35130,Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light,This is a horrible PC port. POOR CONTROLS. AWFUL GAMEPAD SUPPORT. LAGGY/ BUGGY NETCODE. SHARE CAMERA why not seperate cameras between players like in Shoot Many Robots? PASS.
351300,Ceres,"This game has potential...but it's the same with every game that has potential, it doesn't use it and probably never will. It is bugged as hell and everyone who says it isn't is plain wrong! SKills aren't working all the time, allies are attacking you without being provoked, enemie weapons have unlimitied range even when you can't even see them anymore because of them being thousands of km away... For an alpha or pre alpha state game it would be frustrating but understandable but this wants to be a released title...bad joke! For a pre alpha game the price is horribly overprized..."
351330,DROD RPG: Tendry's Tale,Nice game!
351340,Belladonna,"It's more like visual novel than adventure game. Pretty straight - only one room with 'crossroad', where you. It's a pity becase it has good graphic, animation, character design, voiceover. But the game and story part are very dissapointing."
35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,"A Masterpiece, enough said. +++"
351400,The Defenders: The Second Wave,One for the trash bin
351410,Clean'Em Up,"Nice, would be great with controller support!"
351420,Veteran Combat,Some devs finally made a game with 404 mb to install.
351450,Scribble Space,"I really didn't get even an ounce of fun from this. For ship-based shooters, I enjoyed Revolution Ace much more. It had a progression system, much better visuals, etc. The shaky white lines on a 47' TV were less crafty &amp; cute, more annoying and basic. It didn't work with my xbox360 controller, despite claim of Partial Controller support. Keyboard control was ok. But gameplay was just really boring. (0/5 stars, buy it for trading cards)"
351490,Intergalactic Bubbles,"Puzzle Bobble but with physics. It's something I never knew I wanted, and man is it satisfying."
351630,Fire With Fire: Online Tower Attack and Defense, Early Access Review
351640,Eternal Senia,"Very nice, but too short!"
351700,UnReal World,I played this AWESOME survival game YEAAAAAAARS ago and was so glad to see it on steam I bought it. This game may not look that pretty but the contents is HUGE. Very chalenging also. A real gem.
351720,Solar Division,"In this tower defence game you're supposed to defend different stations around the galaxy each with three levels of challenge. Each station has it's own style, look &amp; feel and you can choose between three different difficulty levels.  Game's nice and has it's own take on the tower defence genre, worth a try for TD fans. :-]"
351730,On My Own, Early Access Review
351790,Invisible Apartment,"TLDR: HEY, THAT'S PRETTY GOOOOOOOD  This is really a great game. A lot of people think the writing is bad; IMHO it's really great, it's clear the creators know what they're talking about and provide lots of thoughts about this future world that are realistic and feasible, something too many scifi games miss."
351800,Dev Guy,"It might be free but a bad parody is a bad parody.    Story:  You are a dev who needs to hack into (play) other people's game to finish his. It's a simple concept and there are 3 characters who have dialogue. However, none of them are actually interesting as the premise is all about poking fun of the indie dev scene but it just makes bad jokes.   Phil Fish, MLP, Hentai, body pillows, hacking, and pretentious point and click adventure game jokes? I guess they could be funny if someone with actual humor wrote them instead of just a poster on the wall. It's a good concept but failed to live up in the comedy department.    Gameplay:  you can walk around in a hub world which is barren pretty much and has nothing. Other than that, you play simple examples of different genres of games. Level by level platformers, endless runners, adventure games, etc... I understand that the game is supposed to be a parody so it shows different types of games but a good parody would make fun of the concept not just do the concept. The adventure game was actually funny because it was quick and the joke was apparent. Otherwise, the gameplay was dull and tedious.  P.S. I feel like someone was learning to make video games and just threw in all the modes they could. Like jiggly physics or slow motion for no reason.    Graphics/Performance:  (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD) Unreal engine is used but it looks like crap and runs at 60. No graphics options and no resolution options    Final Thoughts:  It had potential and it seems like it could have been fun. However, it was really dull and boring. The humor fell flat and the game was short. It's free but not that good."
351810,MadSpace: To Hell and Beyond,"I don't remember getting this game. Playing through it, it's some sort've weird FPS game with clunky visuals and it's impossible to find your way around the first area. I gave up after just half an hour, although I may give it a second shot. Aside from the annoying, boring and unskippable railshooter sequence, this game seems like the experience of a lifetime... Or at least the experience of drugged up Russians."
351820,Z.A.R.,"It's a Russian version of Quake/Doom/Duke nukem, so you know it's going to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockoff. Basically every level is the game, just a giant open area of hills and valleys, whose color changes on some levels. You run around these hills shooting tanks, turrets, and planes, that's it. Enemies are boring and repetitive. It's super ugly and the draw distance is terrible, as you can't see anything in the distance. The map is terrible and unhelpful. The worst part is the mission design. Most levels you are just supposed to kill a certain number of machines. What this ends up being is you kill 16 of the 20 you are supposed to kill, and spend the next 10 min continuously wandering around the same hills looking for the final 4. Because all the enemies are spread about without rhyme or reason it can be very frustrating. Since the map has no enemies on it, and theres no waypoint or marker on your HUD, and every hill and valley looks the EXACT same without any structures or landmarks, you are screwed. This happened multiple times and feels like lazy design. You use the same 3-4 guns, a rocket launcher, gattling gun, grenade launcher, and annoyingly unhelpful tornado thrower. Enemies take tons of hits to die. Finally after the 5th level of wasting 15 min running around the open area looking unsuccessfully for 1 guy I saw the game for what it is, a lazy Russian POS, like most products from their. It does have destructible environments though. 3/10."
351860,Cultures - Northland,"The graphics are sloppy and the female characters has absolutely no other function on this game besides have children and take care of a home. You can't even assign them to simples tasks, they can't have any profession. Male characters, otherwise, can perform any tasks and have many skills to develop.   The developers should do a better research on women in viking society, it's outraging to PAY for a game that support that sexist line of construction in XXI century."
351870,Cultures - 8th Wonder of the World,"One of my favored games, highly requmended. Need to bring this game back to life."
351910,Valhalla Hills,"It is an okay game. Until the 4th map I had fun. The game has some kind of bug in Windows 10 64-bit that causing the game to become unresponsive like4 minutes into the level. So I am stuck here. I did play this same level on Windows 7 and did not experiencing the problem. Oh Well, decent game got it really cheap.  Not recommended due game breaking bug and because I cannot post this without choosing one."
351920,Crazy Machines 3,why did i buy this i could have had some ck2 dlc
351940,The Descendant,"No!  This game maybe would be ok. its indie but well the story is interesting, the character maybe ok. but dont buy this game. clunky controlls ruined it and a 'season' which you played through in around 25 minutes (or less) are very very low. the price is absolute to high for this game. maybe 5 bucks for the hole season would be ok. but only if this has a absolute fantastic story... only played season 1 and must say if the otehr seasons are as short and patchwork as season one its absolute waste of money! Over all to let the game download 8gb for 25min gameplay gives it the cake."
351970,Tales of Zestiria,"Being a veteran of the tales series, I feel that I am in a position to give a reasonable review of why this is the 2rd best tales game, an unpopular opinion of those who have played the series in it's entirety.    First 5 minutes"
351990,Riff Racer," Here In My Car, I'm Outdritin' 'Em All!"
3520,Mystery PI: The Vegas Heist,It`s a nice casual game. I prefer it more than rosecliff island and amazing adventures.
352010,Beach Bounce,its good like the devs other games 
352030,The World Named Fred,"Frikin great game with great adventure and story, although, when will the sequel come out?"
352050,Chesster,sometimes it would score and others it didnt.sometimes itll place my piece in the wrong spot even though the cursor was in the middle of the cube.ITSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS TTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  
352070,Fort Meow,"Essentially a reverse Angry Birds with cats. Really need a 'sorta' button here.   Fun game concept and I liked the background story, but there wasn't enough strategic depth to the choices, or enough clear interaction between the mechanics of the different items to make it stand out in its genre. There was also an insane difficulty jump at the end game with the introduction of a build timer with a very short countdown.  Overall it was entertaining, but better games in the same genre to be found. "
352130,Locoland,"Extremely fun real time strategy game and will keep you engaged for hours! This is a very unique game, unlike no other I have ever played. The only disappointment is that it needs a sequel and much much longer campaign!"
352140,Finders,"You are forced to follow a strict specific path. Collecting anything out of order will cause you to not be able to complete a certain goal. You do not get credit for anything you do ahead of time. Failure to complete a goal will cause you to have to restart from the very beginning again regardless of how far you've gotten with your current game. You must also wait for whatever you are doing to complete (the boring part).   Eventually I got so bored that I deleted it. Not worth the price, even if it's on sale. Got mine in a bundle thankfully. "
352160,Curse of Mermos,its so hard it takes away the fun part and you dont get a single safe place + whats with you restarting the whole game ? And the whole game is just button mashing even ign said so.
352170,MadOut,"I like the soundtracks and when the maps are a little more advanced instead of just a simple road, it should be more of that :)   AND i like the explosions"
352190,Spirit Of War,Excellent little war game 
352210,Little Cells,"Now this was a whole lot of fun. A very sylish game and nice easy menus. I liked having the tutorial after I jumped right in first time and didn't really know what I was doing.  There is something wickedly addictive with this game. For some reason there is some sick pleasure in banging those cells together before they go sour. You can have to stay alert because it can all go very pear shaped very quicky just when you think you've got it nailed.  Easy to see that a lot of time and love has gone into this. Nice music, suits the gameplay well. Great job."
352220,King of Dragon Pass,"This is probably a good game. But it suffers heavily from being a mobile port. Basic things like windowed mode, changing resolution and volume sliders don't exist. You can't save manually or maintain saves for different clans. At the moment this port doesn't seem to offer much in increased functionality versus running the mobile version on an emulator, except that then at least I'd be able to run it in a window."
352240,The Westport Independent,"People compare this to 'Papers, Please', but they are quite different games. 'Papers, Please' gets a sort of frantic feel as you try to work fast enough to earn money to support your family, while this game can be completed at your leisure and gives you time to think. The scales are also completely different; in this game you are impacting the political direction of an entire city, while in 'Papers, Please' you have a much more immediate effect on single people as they enter your sphere of influence. Both games are excellent, and I think they provide pretty differently impactful experiences if you give each of them a chance."
352280,Cakewalk Sound Center,Worst £481.78 in my life. Avoid this trash at any cost.

352520,The Silent Age,Awesome Game!!! :D . One of the best indie game. . Short Story but awesome.  Must play game :)

352620,Porcunipine,"It's a really good game, so much fun :D"
352640,The Indie Mixtape,"I suppose...it's a mixtape. So it's hit and miss. Some of the games are good. Some of them are bad. But overall, personally - I believe the bad outway the good (maybe it will change later, I don't know)  I've played them all, and there's only one I liked. The other 4 are bland, repetitive and lack any depth. They have nothing going for them. No story. No fun gameplay. Nothing.   The only one I liked was the puzzle game which actually has fun puzzles and a good story, the rest are complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥.  Even the one I liked got bland and repetitive quickly. Seriously. Don't waste your money. I brought this from humble store so I gave money to charity, but man...was this a waste. Even as an indie dev, I can't feel that this is one of those things done for a quick buck.  It had so much potential, yet it failed to deliver."
352700,Subspace Continuum,Pew pew after school Pew pew after homework Pew pew after dinner Pew pew after supper  Realize I have better things I could be doing  Pew pew after realization
352750,Road Works,i find the tutorial is not enough but looks a fun game if i knew what i was doing
352760,Kaiju Panic,Can't seem to build the first building in Level 1.1 :/ 
352780,An Octave Higher,"There's a lot to like here, from the amusing magical science classes that look like they leapt out of my software engineering classes, to character interactions and story concepts (heavily alluding to Indonesian class struggles and historical riots. You don't have to possess any knowledge on the topics, but those who kow will appreciate the added depth).  As fellow reviewers had noted, the pace-tone shift might be somewhat jarring (between the first and second act), and I can see why it could seem like two different games. However, despite a few plotholes here and there, An Octave Higher offers you a world worthy to experience. I like that this Visual Novel does not try to force-advance character relationships romantically, instead focusing on their roles in the story.  The writers tried to give nuanced personality to every character so none appeared particularly good or bad, but somewhere in the gray area. A commendable effort, though some might come across as being 'tryhard'. Perhaps the prequel would make up for this.  For those who like their stories tied up neatly, however, An Octave Higher might leave you wanting. The ending is open to interpretation, and some plot points were loosely let go.   Spoiler:   Frederic's ending   was so damn weird. I wonder whether the writers had run out of ideas at that point or that they thought they should at least offer that ending as a lighthearted option.   May provide a more detailed review later."
352790,Futuridium EP Deluxe,"hey fam, if you like vivid colours and spaceships and ♥♥♥♥, you should buy this game, gnomesayin'."
352850,DGU: Death God University,"I can't open my journal, when I press 'J' nothing happens"
352890,Caravan,"Seems like a fine game, the big complaint I have is the speed at which it moves / allows skipping of text. It just takes too long to actually play."
352950,Better Late Than DEAD,"There may well be an interesting storyline here, which is why I bought the game. But I can't go past the clunky controls and the graphics feel like something from the 1990s. Even the music is clunky, with its stops and starts. Its obviously a ripoff of Far Cry, but I think that being able to produce a game like that is a fantasy for these developers.  I wish I could get my money back, but there are two learnings I can take away. Read the Steam reviews first, and never buy anything from Excalibur Games."
352960,Star Horizon,"This game would be a million times better if it had a better targeting system than the one they currently have. Even for a rail shooter, the story gets a bit repetitive with no real incentive to continue playing besides the ship upgrades, which are kind of meh."
3530,Amazing Adventures Around the World,"I enjoy HO games, but this , personally, lost it's fun value about 10 'missions' in. Then it was just a lot of redundancy. I don't mind redundancy, if it's challenging. This game really isn't a challenge at all for me. About half of the time spent 'playing' this game was me minimizing it to do other things because I grew bored of it at the moment, then coming back to it later.  Pros:  - Great way to spend some free time, especially if you enjoy HO puzzle games - Simple to play - Music is not that bad. (I personally mute it to listen to my music, but the game soundtrack isn't bad.) -Use of hints for finding those tricky (and poorly) named objects.  Cons:  - Game loosed it challenge about a third of the way into it. - Puzzles become VERY redundant. - Many of the items you had to find in the later HO challenges were rather vague at what the object could be. It would say one thing and mean something completely different. (Example is it would want you to find a tool. A hand saw is a tool, but it's not the tool it wants you to find.) - Graphics could be better, but for the age of this game, I'm not going to complain too much.    Everyone has their own opinion, but I personally lost my appeal for this game. It was a nice time waster, that was about it."
35300,Warfare,"Saudi Arabia, one of the world's leading oil suppliers and a key U.S. ally, has been taken over by a highly organized group of radical terrorists. The government is in a state of collapse and turmoil and you have been chosen to lead the United States' armed forces to restore control.  Search and destroy using the latest military hardware from the Abrams tank to the Apache helicopter in realistic settings ranging from the open desert to close-quarters infantry combat. Wear down enemy morale by capturing vehicles, weapons and buildings. You'll need elite forces to destroy the world's best-armed fanatics, bent on world-wide economic collapse. The soldiers who survive will gain experience and move with you from mission to mission.  Failure is not an option — This is Warfare."
353070,Ghost Encounters: Deadwood - Collector's Edition,"Not a fun HOG. It did bore as things just got repetitive. Plain and simple this game just bored me. When I got to the end I was like thankfully i finished this game. Also u would think the ending would of lead to something big but it just didn't.  The voice acting was not very good, the music was ok does the job for setting a creepy mood, the bg was nice. and the animation was not to good.  But the worst and I mean the worst was that there is no map in this game:( Also the hint button doesn't even point to where u need to go. An example would be like the hint will tell u to find a srewdriver but will not direct u to where the screwdriver is. U have to find that item somewhere. This might be the first HOG I've played that had no map. Since I;ve played so many HOG I can't rememeber if I have played a HOG with no map. Also I have no idea why this is called a collectors edition. There are no extras in this HOG. There is not even map to be worthy to be called a collectors edition.  All in all if u are really bored and just want to play a HOG with easy puzzles then this HOG is for u to play. Also get this on a sale as I did too."
353090,Chicken Invaders 5,Horrible Horrible Horrible compared to previous games. Each one moved forward this was not even half as good as the 2nd.
35310,Clutch,I totally recommend to NOT BUY this game!  It's probably the worst racing game that I have ever played!  The A.I and physics are completely bollox! Only good part about this game is the music and racing over zombies...
353110,Dreamscapes: Nightmare's Heir - Premium Edition,"I like hogs but finishing this one was mostly a chore. Too often you have no idea where to go and there is no map to tell you where there are actions waiting for you. The beholders are a nice touch but two or three were just impossible to find, maybe a bug? The puzzles are mostly ok but sometimes you have to put something exactly in the right place in order to make something work. Also the area's where you click are way too big."
353130,Time of Dragons,"So game is sort of frustrating since seasoned players camp the spawn point and take you out immediately to get easy kills. I was in team mode and my team members were nowhere to be found.  Also there appears to be a 'play with friends' aspect, but there is no friends-only version of the game, it's either versus all or team v team.  The concept is pretty cool, but i'll get no experience if I just get killed instantly upon arriving on the scene by those spawn campers."
353190,Bombshell,"This is the first time i have asked for a steam refund since the refund feature was implemented and this is my first negative review of a game i have ever written, i only played 40 mins of the game but that was more than enough time to show me how much of a pile of turd this game is.   i was expecting the protagonist to be tough but sexy like the character Bayonetta but instead Shelly 'Bombshell' Harrison is a butch lesbian who has a disdain for men (more feminist propaganda) i went in thinking the game was going to be like a top-down duke nukem version of bayonetta but all i took from it was that this game is just progressing further the feminist agenda that i see taking over the entertainment industry and our society.   but my opinion of the lead role and the subliminal feminist message aside the frame rate of the cutscenes are laggy as f*ck, the combat feels like sh*t, and the voice acting, characters and game world feels like they just pulled ideas out of a hat and decided to implement whatever idea they pulled out. this game feels like a total cash grab as well, $30 for this piece of sh*t? they are trying to rip us off on top of all the negative things i mentioned.   the only positive things i have to say about this game is the music is pretty good and the graphics are colorful and easy on the eyes.  The Bottom line: Don't buy this game unless you are some left-wing feminist who complains that there aren't enough strong female lead roles in movies and in games well they made the perfect game for you, too bad most of you feminists have no idea what actually accounts as a good game."
35320,Insane 2,"I unfortunately never had the chance to play the first 1nsane, which I hear was a fantastic experience, and from what I understand the multiplayer is next to nonexistent for this game. However. This is perhaps one of the most enjoyable racing games I've played. There's plenty to unlock in the way of cars and upgrades, and most of the ways to unlock new cars and gain points for cars requires a little effort, but every moment is enjoyable and worth it - by racing and completing objectives on mainly off-road courses against other AI vehicles who are very aggressive in achieving those goals. The world physics are set to the extreme - this means that your car will often not have more than one or two tires on the road for most of the time you are racing, and drifting on dirt and snow is commonplace. The emergency braking and the boost make it even more entertaining, and add in AI vehicles that are under the same influences... it makes for a crazy fun experience. There's plenty of various game modes to enjoy, from a more traditional off-road race to Pursuit of following a helicopter and staying under it to Greed, which is a point box drop collect-a-thon. All of them bring their own mayhem, and while often frustrating, it's also adrenaline-pumping and hilarious to see what happens as cars smash into one another and chunks of metal fly off. Your car can take damage, and you'll see the wear and tear. It doesn't actually impact how your vehicle handles however (which may be a pro or a con depending on your viewpoint), and unlike in the first 1nsane where you could apparently keep driving with a wheel or two missing, your car simply breaks if you lose one and just have to reset your car. Which has a dedicated key, and I've often abused it to give myself an edge in the CTF modes, where the flag actually has a physical impact on how your car handles and can cause it to flip, especially if you're in a smaller buggy or sprinter and not a massive truck. All of this, and everything looking good while blasting along at insane speeds. Seriously, this game has some great aesthetics - and it won't break your computer while pleasing your eyes. I'd highly recommend getting this game even on its own, and if you can get some friends to play it online with you, I can imagine there's plenty of laughs and yelling bloody murder at the screen to be had."

353300,Rooftop Cop,"This is a collection of five minigames that are not interconnected.  Games 1, 2 and 5 are well, I don't know what's their point. Games 3 and 4 are at least playable to some extent - game with breaking through glass walls is easy to comprehend and easy to play. Game 4 is something like a building your raft from materials that you gather from randomly generated environment.   What's the meaning of the title? No idea.   I would not recommend buying this standalone, it's a waste of money."

353340,Dungeon Highway,I know the cost is very cheap but the game was way too simple. Felt like a Flash game you'd play on your browser for free for 10 minutes.
353360,how do you Do It?,"I feel like this game is a joke that I wasn't in on. Like, one person proposed the idea that they use the afternoon to create a game with no point but had an unusual theme. Then, sit back and watch people discuss how 'powerful', 'artistic', 'daring', or 'important' it was, a la Andy Kaufman. But really, they could have done just that by creating a game where you were a 11 year old girl catching fire flies in a jar. Boom! Nastalgia! Plus, you could overlay some generic 'innocense of youth' nonsense and you'd still have a game with some sort of challenge and reward system. Dang...did I just fall into the trap by writing this review?  Don't play this game or they win."
353540,Stephen's Sausage Roll,I don't know if I'll ever complete this game. Features extremely difficult but rewarding puzzles. Each area requires you to have a new epiphany which gets rather exhausting! Only for the most dedicated puzzle fan.
353550,House of Caravan,"Pleasantly surprised! I received this game in a $20 bundle of 40-something games; most of them were complete trash but House of Caravan got me hooked and I played through it all in one sitting. It isn't a long game and the puzzles aren't brain-melting but the story keeps you going and for such an indie game the house is very detailed. You can open every drawer and cupboard, pick up almost every object and examine it... it reminds me a lot of Gone Home but with a darker story.  If you're looking for a quick 2-hour puzzle game in the vein of Amnesia, check this one out!"
353560,Plug & Play,There is not much to say about this game. It's funny and extremely weird.  A good way to have some laughs with your friends   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6V0lAdARUU  
353580,Rad Rodgers: World One,"Rad Rodgers is what it says on the package: a 90's Platformer.  Rad Rodgers is what you get when you mix Conker's Bad Furday with a tiny bit of Contra. It's a very simple game for what it is and I love it about that.  If you're not sure from what you've seen; then you'll want to know that this game is rather short, but fun enough to be able to replay once or twice.  This game in particular has a charm that more than 'just 90s kids will get'; you run and gun while finding secrets and collectibles. I have 7 hours showing on this game, but I only really played 4-5 before beating it and that's while I explored the game heavily too.  I would attempt to gush; but this game caters to a particular audience and if you're not it, then you'll know it. The characters are charming for what they're made for and the music is just a punchy and fun time all around.  Now, would I recommend this game? Definitely, if you've spent 10 bucks on an unsure game or just a large lunch; then you can spare the money for this game as it can be quite a chuckle and what looks to be a promising future of a probable sequel as well."
353600,Spellbind,"This is the biggets crock of ♥♥♥♥ i've ever seen.  ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ made this ♥♥♥♥, literally worse than xbox indie game cancer trash.

353640,Train Valley,"Overall it's quite fun as a mini-game.  However concidering the price, the game itself is a little bit too simple.  I have played about 80% of the stages (if there is no hidden ones), thre is only one game-method. Video, audio, every-part is just OK, but not good, I'm gonna say."
353700,The Deadly Tower of Monsters,"+Good voiceover +Decent humor , Tongue in cheek +Love the old school Sci-fi film vibe  -Very basic third person action/platformer gameplay  Gameplay was pretty bland. Felt like a chore, the humor wasn't enough reason to keep going.  I wanted to like this since the art direction and commentary was charming but I really can't get immersed with the simplistic gameplay. It felt like they poured so much into the art direction and dragged their feet on the game itself."
353790,Spud!,"This is one of the only things that I remember from my childhood. I was so excited when I found out that it's on Steam. My dad, my sister and I would play this and Toonstruck all the time and recently I bought Toonstruck on GOG and I just bought this today and have completed the first half in just under 2 hours. I can't believe I can still remember what to do after about 12 years or more. So good to be able to play again! :-) I also can't believe this has bad reviews??? 10/10"

354200,Aberoth,"I only played this game for a short while, but so far I've had a good time with it. This is why I'll mostly go into the negative parts of the game, and not the positive.  Only a few players tried to kill me, I barely lost anything when I got killed by NPCs. So I haven't experienced the merciless high level thugs people have been talking about.  But regarding the negative reviews, a lot of the things they say are correct. Some of my experiences: 1. Community is toxic (I just witnessed a bunch of people arguing about pointless drivel), 2. The world is very small, 3. Grinding takes a lot of time, 4. Quests are the typical 'kill x of y' 'bring x of y', 5. I can see that there have been no content for a while, even though I just started playing yesterday (probably the reason why high level players are harassing lower level ones 6. Pink Rabbit (unique/rare mob with valueable drop) and Rabbit look the same   7. One important NPC has been stuck since yesterday, and the developers still haven't fixed it,    Developer fixed it a few hours later.   8. Realm changing is almost impossible to free players, 9. Very little content,  I mentioned before that I was almost killed by a few people before, I'll be adding the names of such hostile players names here:      Hitman (failed)    Thechara (failed)    Sucosuco (failed)    Watch out for these players.   [Also, here is a little advice if you are thinking about playing this game. Only players with pink names can attack you, normally everyone has a white name(friendly) unless they intentionally change into 'hostile players'. So watch out for players with pink names. Especially if their names change color right before your eyes, because they are definitely going to attack you, so run immediately.]"
354230,Devouring Stars,"Uninstalled after 20 minutes. A boring game with pretty graphics hampered by annoying melodramatic mumb-jumbo, and unintuitive controls. Waste of money. There are free games on the web that involve similar mechanics and they do it far better."

35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,"Nearly no server with any player, the one with any player will just kick you after joining if you don't lie and say you have hundreds of hours of play.  Mechanically it works fine, but since there is no way of actually playing, there is no point of buying."
354560,We Are Legion,"So you have this little guy to protect with massive armies, but it's terribly bugged, if try to build something, there is 50/50 chance building or that dragon lord dude explode, If you are lucky and building explodes, price inflation is still there. I would like share more info, but if training scenario is so messed up, there is no reason to try anything else in this game. This game is god example, why you should check forums and reviews first. To simplify it, this game has quality level of anything made in China."

354650,MISSING: An Interactive Thriller - Episode One,"Short but simply great for those who, like me, are nostalgic of the FMV games like the Tex murphy serie or Black Dahlia. Need more !"
354680,Adventures of Bertram Fiddle: Episode 1: A Dreadly Business,"  Stylistically, this is interesting enough that I wanted to like it - but it just doesn't deliver. Incredibly simplistic, obvious puzzles in a linear plot that doesn't really get that interesting. You solve puzzles before you even know why you need to solve them. The voice work is tediously slow, and for some characters just plain annoying - so you find yourself skipping most of it and reading the subtitles.  It might suit a 12 year old, but then most of the jokes wouldn't work - plenty of innuendo wrapped up in innocense."
354690,The Lost City Of Malathedra,"This adventure is an amateur effort, and may well be the worst adventure I have paid money for.  The story is weak. The interactions are often illogical, progress is often trial and error, pixel hunting abounds, invisible walls everywhere, as a consequence the pathing is atrocious, the UI is clunky, the sounds are nothing to write home about (and the screams clearly fake), the effects are 'fade to white' and 'fade to red', the graphics are flash-style vector art married to eye-bleeding 'latest 3D hardware' backgrounds (if by 'latest' they mean ca. 1993 - Myst looked better than this), and the dialogues are boring. Also, it's short.  Take your pick from any of  these  and you'll be likely better off."
354720,STATIC: Investigator Training,"Not very good, with lots of problems. The game puts you into the role of a would-be paranormal investigator. As a test you're asked to investigate the house they're based out of.   The game uses FMV's, but does so badly. there is no perspective (the character stays the same size closer and farther from the camera, and tries to use lipsync (badly). During conversations the character images (apart from the lipsync) are pretty much static, yet look like they have been cut out using mspaint. Apart from that it's a point and click adventure, but short (1-1.5 hrs according to other reviewers). The narrative is quite cringeworthy at times.   The pricing is crazy. This is definitely not worth the 8 bucks the store asks for it. Luckily (or not) I got this from a bundle. For 2 euros more you can get 'The Lost Crown', another paranormal investigation game, which unlike this game, delivers, and does so for 30+ hours.  Dear Strategy First, why the hell did you publish this? "
354730,Deadly Sin,"Well, game finished. What can I say... the story isn't bad, but I was bored - in every area there are only few types of monsters always reapearing, every battle takes some time (3-6 rounds), the encounters are quite frequent, and I ended up using usually the same moves, what made the game repetitive. No maps too, sometimes you end up blindly wandering to find the right way.   There are few minor flaws - some monsters are starting with health 30000/99999, or they have healing skills with no effect. And   Ardelia   - has 50000 health, after killing one of my character she heals 10 000. But after killing my Belinda she got like +100 000 health and had something about 126 000/50 000 health?"
354740,Echoes of Aetheria,"I feel bad giving it the thumbs down, because it's not terrible by any stretch, but it's only alright. Not as good as Skyborn, definitely.  The combat system seems fine, enjoyable, I've played rpgmaker games that had better systems, but I've easily played worse; this one is perfectly respectable. My main problem is that the writing and the tone are just all over the map- it starts by feeling like it's going to go into some interesting, serious political cloak-and-dagger material with some serious weight behind it.... and then it turns into bad camp with sarcastic lampshades on game mechanics.... and then they try to go 'horros of war' on you just a few minutes after that, like the cheesy parts never happened.  If you go in expecting that, it might not be nearly as bad, but I was expecting the game to take itself mostly seriously. Comedic relief, sure, but it feels like they either went overboard, or just some of the writing that's trying to be serious is falling very flat.  There's a fair ammout of worldbuilding and story going on here as well that's... fine, really. The characters and the world and story are all fine, whenever the game decides to have a serious tone for more than a minute, but the rest of the time it just feels like the writing is letting down material that might otherwise have worked a lot better.  I really wanted to like this one, and I don't  dislike  it, I'll probably still finish it, but she's just not selling what I was hoping to buy, I guess.  Edit: So, after a few more hours playing, the story has gotten a  little  better, but I think that's mostly the cheese growing on me. The combat, on the other hand, gets a LOT more fun once you pick up the 4th party member, so that part is improved significantly. Still not amazing, but better."
354770,Trigger Saint, Early Access Review
35480,Dwarfs!?,"Saruman the White reviewed this game a little while ago: 'The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.'  I wouldn't hold it against him. In the beginning it's quite easy to keep them under controll. Set a path there, build a wall there. Then the dwarfs are everywhere and you're putting out fires left and right.   By that I mean litteraly fires, because someone dug into a lava pit. Don't worry though, most likely another dwarf is just about to dig a hole into a waterfilled cavern. That will cancel each other out. If not, it will at least kill these goblins too, that one of your dwarfs let into your kingdom.   Next time, you could take a little more care of them. Would you, please."

354860,The Adventures of Tree,"It crashes before it finishes loading after the introdution, although it seems quite promising.  Because of this I cannot play the game at all, but the devs have put in a lot of effort in trying to fix the problems, so if you have some issues with the game i assure you that they will work hard to try and fix them.  (I am running it on a Surface Pro 3 256GB i5 with Intel HD Intergrated Graphics 4400) (if you have a different graphics processor it should work fine)  I don't really know whether to recommend or not recommend:  - I can't run it but  - devs worked hard to try and fix my issue and  - it works fine on other computers  so...  I'll recommend it to others who don't have a surface pro 3 with Intel HD Graphics 4400  (If someone gets it to work with a surface pro 3 let me know if u did anything special to get it to work.)"

355020,Bomb The Monsters!,"I played this with my young daughter but while she enjoyed it, it drove me nuts.  The physics engine is unpredictable and often, the same action results in a different response. There is an achievement score that appears not to do anything. It's buggy and really needs that final but of polish.  It's like a prettier Bad Rats."
355050,Sky Force Anniversary,"I'm a huge shoot'em up fan. Since I got a C64 I started playing games like Terra Cresta, R-Type, Gemini Wings, ... and this one is my favorite Shoot'em up game right now. After spending so many hours playing it on android I discovered it was also available on Steam so I bought it quickly and stated playing again. Great and detailed graphics, co-op option, cool upgrade system, progressive difficulty. I trully recomend this game if you're into shoot'em ups."
355060,Sebastien Loeb Rally EVO,"I thought it was gonna disappoint because it's developed by Milestone.   But their work seems to pay off with the physics, car content and stage lengths. The only drawback with this game is the damage model (how the car behaves to crashing) the sound and not many countries listed in the game BUT they do have a decent length of track for the countries that they do contain in the game.   Asides from that it's pretty damn good. Even the physics"

355100,Dungeon Crawlers HD,"I do not like the digitalized 3D graphics, the music is grating. The strategy feels shallow, the UI is awkward and the controls clumsy.

I don't think the game is utterly terrible, if you are looking for something simple and generic you might enjoy this. I know I didn't."

I do not remember a game giving me such joy, it was trully the same feeling i had back in 1994 when i played the original for the first time."
355270,199X,"Developer Evan Tognotti calls 199X a “game without mechanics” but, strictly speaking, this is not a game. And if you’re looking to play a game, you’ll probably be disappointed.   Rather, this is a story -- a good story at that. A story in which you are given the illusion of control, but have none. Which is all the more ironic in that you’re supposed to be controlling Claire -- she’s unable to act without you. And yet, over and over again, you will be stifled because Claire has it in her mind to do something else. Your entire enjoyment of 199X will depend entirely on whether you’ll enjoy the story.  So how is the story? It’s pretty good. Brilliant, in fact.  I found myself immediately taking a liking to Claire, a lesbian who’s found herself without memory in a place where she’s been involuntarily institutionalized. Claire hears a voice, and that voice happens to be you.  199X touches upon several themes: nostalgia, unrequited love, the paradox of choice. Typically, I hate games made from RPGMaker -- when I see these recommended to me on Steam, I typically choose “No thanks”. But I really can’t think of any other art style that would work here.   The title “199X” is fitting. You inhabit a dystopian universe that looks wistfully on 90s culture as a golden age, and yet knows so little about it. There’s allusions to Final Fantasy VI and lo-fi indie rock. If you’re over the age of 30, some of this stuff will hit you in the feels.   What makes this game so great is that you really do get inside Claire’s head. The game is divided up into 7 days, and at the end of each day, you must rest. When you rest, you get to dream with Claire, and you uncover just a little bit about her.  The pain that Claire feels seems real. This is a woman in search of connection. Each time she seems to get close to someone, something traumatic happens. You begin to wonder if there’s something about Claire that causes these events to unfold.  This is one of the few “games” that I started and finished with absolutely no breaks. It took me around three hours to complete it.   199X made me reflect on many things: desire, loss, and memory. It made me think about mortality and destiny. This wasn’t an easy story to interact with, but it was worth it."
355310,Blood Alloy: Reborn,"This has a fantastic combat engine, but when you look at what you get, I cant honestly recommend this. 3 Levels, 3 Guns, 3 Sub Weapons, and 7 Armors (3 of which are upgrades to the other 3, and 1 being your starting armor, so can you REALLY call that 7 armors when 3 are just higher tiers? Who would use the LOWER tier??).  I want the metroidvania this was originally gunna become, I want it bad, but the fact I didnt even have to fully level to use everything (theres a bug in the menu where you can just select the items and it'll carry into the mission) is kind of hilarious in its own right.  Buy on sale for maybe $5, if not less. Otherwise, pass this up. Really hope to see more from these devs in the future though!"
355350,Reign of Bullets,"Massively overpriced for what should be a mobile title  Neat mechanic, with the weapon upgrade system but with all the depth of a teaspoon"
355400,Diesel Guns, Early Access Review
355410,Radium,"Radium? More like tedium.   The game is simplistic (perhaps too so), yet the controls are so unresponsive, that it saps all the fun out of it. Puzzles are supposed to be challenging mentally, but this game's solutions are easily found, just executing them is near impossible with the poorly designed physics."
355420,FLAMBERGE, Early Access Review
355430,SNOWFLAKE TATTOO,"Tags : TopDown - Rogue/Dcrawl  Summary : This is the kind of game where you would have more fun looking at a few concept art pieces and letting the dev pitch the idea to you than ever starting the game up.  I rememebr playing this a while ago... you have to uh, grab a key, and another component, and then you can move on to the next area past the forcefield, and then you gotta collect the same stuff again. I remember you gotta shoot stuff using a weird weapon, I cant remember if you use sadness, or psychic energy as ammo, but it was some kinda cool concept, not that it made any difference, I also vaguely remember an AI companion that talked to you to give you hints, she was useless but she was BY FAR the coolest thing on this title.  This dev needs to ditch these kind of games and just make a visual novel out of his pixelart it would be more playable and at least we could enjoy his gaming universe to our satisfaction rather than just have a few nuggets here and there teased at us with weirdo concepts."
355500,Leadwerks Game Launcher,   Early Access Review
355510,Crazy Belts,"Levels seem to be split into two groups: to easy and to difficult. So you either get bored, or annoyed."
355520,The Albino Hunter™ (Original),"Great, funny game after 8 hrs in, did not crash 1 time, had a few laughs, woth its price."
355530,Last Word,"This was a fairly fun game, with a unique premise, though it does tend to get a bit repetitive. Pretty much the entirety of the game play outside of battles consists of walking back and forth within the same couple of rooms, talking to each character over and over until you've exhausted all conversation topics trying to trigger the next story event, and then doing the same thing again and again once you do.  Fortunately, the actual combat portions of the game, which is probably the larger chunk of the game, is pretty good. This is a game where the battle system actually gets better the further you progress. While at first it may seem a bit random and confusing, as you continue to level up and gain new skills it becomes considerably more strategic and satisfying, as your options in battle increase quite a bit.  The game is on the short side; I was able to get both endings in just over five hours, and I imagine it would be fairly similar for everyone else. And the only real replay value comes in the form of starting the game over again just to do things that you accidentally locked yourself out of doing the first time (which is annoyingly easy to do). So, I probably would not recommend getting the game at its full price, as I don't think the amount of content justifies the cost. However, it is often on sale, and is an overall enjoyable game, so I can recommend picking it up then."
355560,Trigger Runners,"Short, simple, sweet, sentimental. These are the words I would use to sum up Trigger Runners. Done in a retro style, its music and graphics hearkening back to the games of yesteryear, it's a pleasant throwback compared to what we usually see.   Gameplay is brief, only about thirty minutes, but it does strike me as reasonably replayable, obviously needed in this format. The story, told via cutscenes, is basic but endearing.   The biggest flaw I see is that the jumps should take a heart away rather than automatically kill you, as they really seem to be the hardest opponents in the game. Besides that, the gun needs to have a broader angle - you should be able to shoot all around you. Shooting stuff just under you is impossible at present. The only other issue is a part where, with the 'barrier' shooting on one level, the little bombs you couldn't blow up blocked your shots, making it nigh impossible to not get hit. It also needs a volume control on the options menu, as well as the ability to pause when a boss is loading.  Does this have particularly engaging gameplay? No. Most bosses are very easy and lack defining traits. But it is a fun, quaint little game to just kick back with and enjoy. Retro, cheap, and has trading cards? I'll take it. Especially recommended if on sale."
355630,Leo's Fortune,"Great platformer with stunning visuals, I just wish it was longer..."
355650,Pirates vs Corsairs: Davy Jones's Gold,"Because of the controls I can't recommend this game. In the mini-games you have the ability to duck but you really can't with a keyboard/mouse and try to fire at an enemy nearly at the same time. This should've been taken into consideration when porting this to the pc. And when in-game the menu-reminders take too much time leaving the screen. In other words, if your opponent fires at you? These irritating messages tell you something like that (even though you can see them doing exactly that on screen). There are many better options out there. Even the Sid Meir's Pirates would be better."
355800,Space Run Galaxy,"Nice idea, adding RPG elements and more open world style gameply to the excellent Space Run, But the result is an immensely grindy game. You need to run the same missions over and over and over again to earn ship parts to very slowly buy new weapons and improve your ship so you can move forward to new missions and into new areas. It started fun, but got tedious much too quickly."
355810,Centauri Sector,2 hours of content isn't really what I expected.
355840,Survarium, Early Access Review
355860,Albino Lullaby: Episode 1,"This game is BRILLIANT! The world you play in looks like something from Beetlejuice, very hyper Burton-esque. It plunges you straight into the action and keeps you intrigued. It's creepy and a bit unnerving but also FUNNY! The voice acting is great, the creatures are ugly and smart enough. I can't wait to see where the story goes. A good, fun and interesting horror game. GET IT!"
355910,Piloteer,"Piloteer, a physics simulator game where you fly a jetpack around to do a bunch of challenges. Simple gameplay makes this a killer purchase. Everything is executed really well. It's overall difficult, but it has a great learning curve. I've had a lot of fun so far.  It captures a lot of the fun of QWOP and other physics based games. Starting off deceptively simple, with only two buttons controlling the jetpack pilot. One thrusts to the left, one to the right. Taking baby steps is key. And the missions start off as little tutorials and slowly ramp up to real accomplishments. You eventually feel really good about each landing you do and every goal you complete. And any game that feels that rewarding is definitely worth a play in my book.  It has achievements, making the climb to jetpack extraordinaire extra fun. It has trading cards, allowing you to catch 'em all. And it's graphics and music pack quite a charm. Overall, I definitely recommend the experience.   https://youtu.be/-7mYiNa7UJU "
355920,Pixel Puzzles 2: Space,"  TL;DR eview : Definitely the bad apple in the Pixel Puzzle bunch.  Bugs: Crashes on exit; No save date lost. Puzzle alignment is off.  Achievements: 100% completion possible by solving all puzzles without using any power-ups (and using them to launch the rockets instead).  Final Verdict:  3/10    The designs are a bit uninspired, the NASA logos are blurred out, and the jigsaw alignment is slightly off to the topright which can cause some annoyances when trying to place side and corner pieces. The difficulty is easy for all puzzles but takes a steep jump up at the final puzzle. "
355970,Home is Where One Starts...,"I think this game had a lot of potential to be a really good game, but it was way too short. It was like a two minute game. On the plus side, it is very beautiful. I would not recommend buying this game unless they add on quite a bit more to it."
355980,Dungeon Warfare, Early Access Review
3560,Bejeweled Twist,still holds up after all these years. it's a shame it got pushed out so fast as to not include the fully developed ice and skull gems.
35600,Big Brain Wolf,"The writing for this game is poor, the main character is depressing to experience, and the puzzles are really generic. I would very much not recommend this game."
356000,The Hero of Kendrickstone,"The story was short and interesting. I liked it but it had many features that seemed to never go anywhere and it doesnt branch at all in story except for a 2 selection side-tangent. I am very sorry to say that this particular choice of games does not have ay replay value, but was still fun to pkay the first few times, but not worth 5 bucks."
356040,Sheltered,game dosent work for me sadly i have a good pc and its updated but when i enter the game the title is all blue that dosent bother me but when i click create a family the whole screen just turns blue i left it on for short periouds installed the game again installed steam again yet it still dosent work
356070,Commander Cool 2,"Commander Cool is a unique 2D side-scroller which appears to have been developed in 2 days. While I generally dislike 2D games, I find a few exceptions in very interesting, well flushed out games. This was not an exception. Gameplay was repetitive and I lost interest very quickly."
356090,Machineers,Machineers is a fun puzzle game! I really enjoy the vibe of the game and the puzzles are challenging but not so difficult they're frustrating.
356110,Box Out!,"Extremely fun, met a guy who worked on the game on omegle. Great platformer, and cool aspect of the different 'boxes'. Challenging but fun, even though I've just tryed it out I expect to play more of it."
356130,Heroes of Scene,This game seems like it would be a good game at first. But then you realize that this game is a bigger pay to win than anything. You could try earning cards but it would be extremely slow to earn them. If this game was on gamejolt and didn't make half of everything 'Buy this starter pack' or 'Buy our stuff to play a game that would take forever to find an acual match. Its basicly pay to be good at the game. And the gameplay is way to basic. Heres basically everything that happens in battles: You send enemies to the other player. Other player sends enemies to defend. You upgrade and build stuff so you can send troops easier. I've seen games like this on minecraft but yet they still seem to be better than this crap. If you want a free to play game that is fun and has less basic gameplay just download TF2 even if you dont have any weapons besides stock you can still be good at the game. Same with PvZ 2 you can but stuff but its not required. Overall this game is just a game where if you didn't but any money into this crap the game penalizes you. And its just so buggy I cant even log in to your buggy game. Pokemon Go is less buggy then this peice of pay to win junk.
356160,The Emptiness Deluxe Edition,"Quite slow game in terms of clicking and moving about, got frustrated with this so stopped playing"
356170,Tile Rider,"..it's like super sprint and sinistar had a baby, and that baby was raised by flynn's arcade.  6/10, four point deduction due to the occasional spawn glitch, a lack of control settings (button assignment), and a   lack of difficulty settings.   quickly lost interest in replay on a few levels after the umpteenth attempt and unskippable cutscenes. an experience worth the price, but only the determined will manage to escape.."
356180,Time Machine VR, Early Access Review
356200,Keen Dreams,THATS MY GAME :)
356210,Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths,"The game is just as good as it was back in 1997. It may look a bit gory with the strong colors, but its surprising charm and wit are sure to win you over in a just a few minutes, and both visuals and voiceovers soon feels like a natural match for the whimsical story. This is a forgotten classic from a bygone era.  The steam release leaves a lot to be desired though, the only way I got it running at all was by configuring and starting scummvm manually and run the game outside of steam. I also think the price is rather steep for a 19 year old game (Even more so considering that they didnt even bother configure scummvm properly), so in the end I can only recommend technically savvy point-n-click fans to grab it at a sale."
356250,Gathering Sky,"Interesting short game. I purchased it, expecting it to be somewhat like the game Journey. I was disappointed in that regard, mostly for the short length. It's cool if you buy games for art value, but not so much as a game."
356260,Stalingrad,"«Stalingrad» is best strategy game, based upon one of  the pitched battles of World War II, a Battle of Stalingrad . The game takes place during the period of July, 1942 - January 1943  and tells a story about one of the most dramatic episodes of World War  II. Featuring two detailed campaigns, «Stalingrad» lets player take  command over Axis army and lead German forces into the city, then  take command of Red Army forces and liberate soviet stronghold from  fascist soldiers and eliminate the 6th Army of Wehrmacht.  In contrast to many other RTS games out there, each mission of  «Stalingrad» is created with historical authenticity in mind and with  reference to the actual place and time to real events that took place  during the war. Besides, missions are created in such a way that campaigns show authentic picture of events at the theatre of war  operations.  Although a player is able to start the game as a Red Army commander,  we strongly recommend beginning with Wehrmacht campaign. First,  this will give a proper picture of actual events at the front, and second,  the game’s difficulty is leveled up gradually as the campaign develops.  Opening missions for Wehrmacht are easiest to play, while final missions for Red Army are naturally the toughest."
356270,Cuban Missile Crisis,"A Cuban Missile Crisis gone hot game based on the blitzkrieg engine, one of my all time favorite games has finally hit steam, so i better write my review after putting it off for so long.  I cant really add much as other reviewers have hit the nail already with how good and bad the game is. For example in CMC you cant endlessly fire your artillery into occupied towns and cities like you could in other games thanks to the near endless supply dumps placed in each mission, in CMC you need to control manufactoring plants and other industry to create ammunition and supplies for you to use which are not put into a big pool to help yourself with, before each battle you need to decide how much Fuel and Ammo that army group is going to get as the one ammo plant you have left might be under siege and if that goes you might not be able to take it back, its things like this that really surprised me when first playing it.  The game forces you to think differently then in other Blitzkrieg styled games, yes you can build more tanks and vehicles and train infantry and such but its done by turn based construction on the world/region map, throwing away the 10 groups of armored cars onto one position on a single battle may have helped you win that battle but you would have shot yourself in both feet in the long run, the massive russian tides the old games have dont work here, you need to be bloody careful with what you bring in the battle.  Be prepared to die a lot, your infantry is Cold War era which means clothing with no body armor will not win when charging a structure with infantry inside shooting out towards the line of infantry charging it. Same concept applies when vehicles move forward towards a fortified position, Tanks are not indestructable and someone with a anti tank gun could do more damage to your battle group then the rest of the opposing force!  This game really makes you rethink warfare post WW3, you have to be damn careful with what you have as replacements are either a long way coming or not coming at all, the game has a lot of fixed premade maps in the campaigns that allow the player to explore and try what method works best when attacking or defending.  As stated earlier in other reviews, units range to 'utterly worthless and not worth the construction time and resources' to 'holy ♥♥♥♥ devs why is this so OP?' Its fun at first sending those waves of cheap worthless tanks forward to protect the valuable stuff until you see it was one tank and one sqaud of infantry that stopped that wave of steel then you smack yourself for wasting potential forces against one enemy tank and some troops hiding behind it, this becomes a problem later on in the game as more heavier and newer technology becomes availiable.  Overall its a good but difficult game and i loved playing it back at release as it was one of the first games that broke me free of the 'Spam cheap units until you win' mindset, and for a fiver? bargain. Get the sequel too."
356280,Desert Law,Piece of garbage
356290,Cuban Missile Crisis: Ice Crusade,"Short pro and con review,  Pros: - good old strategy with the Blitzkrieg engine - a lot of new toys (compared with CMC) - rocket launcher systems ..  Cons: - .. which are to strong - every random-fight will be placed on the same map (yes, the same map !) "
356310,METAL SLUG DEFENSE,"Its free to play, and have other cool stuff in the game.  But the bad thing is that i cant see anyone playing this on the PC version that means its hard to find any player in VS mode.  I dont know why everybody hate this. However for me its a awsome game. Ok got it!?"
356370,Soccer Manager 2015,"This can be a fun game if you take your time on learning how it works. If your a soccer fan that likes how fantasy football is played then you may like this, although there is the latest 2017 so I'm not sure why anyone would play this one anymore but none the less, it still can be fun depending on what you think of games involving a fantasy draft."
356380,Orbit HD,Horrible game should be on IOS for kids. This game isn’t expansive enough to be a actual computer game.
356390,The Slaughter: Act One,"I enjoyed this game, would rate it about 8/10. Looking forward to the following acts, would love to see how the story ends.  There is no voice acting, which shocked me at first but I ended up loving it by the end. Some of the puzzles were quite tricky, others not. I did love the artwork, and the music. This act is a short one, and I got it on sale."
356400,Thumper,"'No mum I don't want to take my medicine tonight! I like the fever dreams, they are my friends now.'"
356420,Interloper,Very cool. Get it. A lot of fun.
356430,Chris Sawyer's Locomotion,It's a cool game!
356500,STAR WARS™ Galactic Battlegrounds Saga,If you like Age of Empires II and Star Wars you must play this game.
356510,Soccer Rage, Early Access Review
356520,Port of Call,"AMAZING!! Love the interaction, the music, the characters. So much fun, Very cool game play it, you won't regret it."
356530,The Confines Of The Crown,"Played this several months ago. The story was all right, somewhat believable, and engaging enough for me at the time. The different endings and backstory were all okay. But nothing was fantastic.  There are probably many more interesting visual novels out there that I could have played instead, and wish I had. This was only an OK game, not something I am all that happy to have spent my time on."
356540,East Tower - Takashi (ET Series Vol. 2),"This review covers all 4 of the East Tower games in one. Simply put, the game isn't very good. The art has occasional good moments but most of it is pretty bad. The story is set up in such a way that it could lend itself to an interesting discussion of gender identity and digital sexuality but it instead chooses to do cliché 'oops, I tripped and grabbed your boob' moments. There are dialog options but the game is still very linear; you either die instantly, find a solution, or pick a solution that gives you a bit of extra dialog.   I would not recommend any of these games except for Kurenai (which was admittedly pretty good). However, there are parts of the Kurenai story that won't make any sense without playing at least a bit of the other ones.  The game is also way too expensive. I bought them all as a set with 40% off ($18 total) and I feel ripped-off. There are much better VNs available for much less. Takashi, Kuon, and Akio were each only about 1.5 hours of play time, which is not a great value.  Finally, every time you finish a section (and there are at least 7 sections per game) the game tries to get you to post to social media. That really pisses me off. It takes me out of the moment to try to get me to advertise for a game that I paid for. Dear game devs, please don't do that!"
356550,East Tower - Kuon (ET Series Vol. 3),"I've given positive reviews to the last two games in the East Tower series (Akio, Takashi) but this one isn't as good. Kuon isn't an interesting character, he acts bipolar and weird, without any of the childhood issues of the previous two romantic interests. It's the longest game in the franchise so far but the length doesn't translate into quality, it's just boring. Replaying through the levels for all the achievements wasn't fun."
356560,East Tower - Kurenai (ET Series Vol. 4),"Actually, before getting this I always thought it looked like trash. Weird fantasy VN dating sim trash. But guess what? I ended up being so addicted during the first part I played them all in a row.  Yes, the beginning parts repeat and it seems as if the story was always the same only with a different guy. But the picture's getting bigger with every part and it's funny and lovely at the same time.  Part of what stopped me from playing these earlier was also the drawing style. Mainly the eyes looked weird and creepy BUT it's a positive surprise in how story makes up for it compared to higher priced VN with excellent style which sadly only bore me to hell. (Cause if I wanted THAT I can read a book/manga or watch anime.)  This series is kinda like a baby of the Cube movies and the Forbidden Game books by Lisa J. Smith. Highly enjoyable!"
356570,Party Hard,"Brilliantly designed game. Rampage through parties, murdering people galore. Acts more like a puzzle with randomly generated pieces (mostly traps and bonuses). Addictive sound track. 10/10, will not throw a house party."
356580,Aerannis,"First impression is that it reminds me of old school Genesis type graphics with anime and mega-man type of influences. It has some stealth features (why I am giving it a try) and is semi-open world. I am still a bit unsure what to make of it, but seems best for younger gamers or adults looking for some comic relief fun. Nothing special so far to keep me that interested yet (will play another hour) at this time when I have many other games, but it has potential, worth picking up if on sale imo."
356670,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,its ok
356710,Band of Drones,"8/10 Great for the price, but has a feeling that more refinement is in the works If you're feeling nostalgic for Lazer Squad then grab some BoD action. This is one of those simple to pick up but deeper and more nuance-ey than it first appears kinda games, and hit all the buttons for remembering old TBS games on the Amiga. Games like this are the reason for Greenlight. I first became aware of this game in a very early version first submitted to GL a long time ago. Since then I've been following it with interest and made a rare Day-1 Full -Price purchase."
356730,The Hole Story,"If 'Katy t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m' made a video game, I imagine it might look something like this."
356770,Astronaut Simulator,Very hard to control didnt get past tutorial way to aggravating for me. Glad i didnt waste more money on this game.6 bucks was bad enough. I used the xbox 360 controller didnt work right for me.There should be a law for every game try before you buy law.
356790,Galacide,"I wasn't expecting much, and I got a little more than I expected. I wouldn't say its my type of STG, but the execution is there. The confined playing space is pretty interesting. I'm happy I experienced it, but ultimately I'd rather shoot stuff in a shooter game.  Interesting concept, good execution, very slow-paced, couldn't keep me interested."
356800,Choice of the Petal Throne,Like everone says its to short the monent i it got gowing it was over
356870,Devoured Time,"Devoured Time is out of Early Access ... i give it a mixed Review cause  +Good Sounds +Low Price +No Crashes  - Story is less then four hours , in Early Access you got more to do then now :/ - In Early Access you could gather ressources or build the City by your own, now you recruit other guys and they build there houses.  - Fights are really boring      Early Access Review 08.05.2016"
356880,Eron,Platformer. Weird play. Many-death oriented. Not my cuppa.
356890,One More Line,"The mechanics seems to be cool, the look and feel of the game fitting and well made. But for such a super minimal core mechanic (there is just one!), it feels unpolished. Maybe it's just me, but it wasn't much fun trying it after a couple of times. It's simply too hard. The learning curve is too steep... It could be fixed by adding a simple training stages, with wider 'channel' and non-random 'nodes'... or other play modes. Just to get the hang of it and get into the flow of the game. But like it is, I will probably not play it anymore... Sorry."
356910,Battle Fantasia -Revised Edition-,A wonderful light hearted fighting game with some great mechanics!  A must have for any fighting game enthusiast.
35700,Trine,"Nice game, best played with 3 friends! "
357030,Excubitor,Frustrating and not fun.
357070,UBERMOSH,"It has a hard learning curve until you read some guides and it gets better. As you gain skill you see the beauty, deflections alone is my favorite class. It can be summed up as an arcade-like high score oriented game. The same 90 second round over and over with a few class mod varients and a hard mode that's actually the easier to score mode. Good little game but try to nab it on sale since it's a very small package of content. If you enjoy going deep on a game that starts off simple, like Geometry Wars, this is a good game to check out."
357120,Big Action Mega Fight!,"This game is very good, the controls you can always change them. The music is very good brings back memories of back in the day on the Ps2. It gets a bit repetitive but its nice overall."
357200,500 Years Act 1,"Not impressed. Combat is pretty awful, trying to turn around and slowly fire blobs at enemy ships. Artwork is crude at best. Pity, some of my favourite old games had a lot in common with this, just that they were realised properly."
357280,Alter World,"  The fact that my first achievement was the 'die 100 times' one should probably tell you a lot about my experience with the game.  Then again, I'm not a fan of puzzle games in general, so your mileage may vary."
357290,Red Lake,The first dog killed me and i unlocked chapter 2. There were spheres that make no sense. Then i quit the game forever. bye
357300,Snakebird,"The dynamics discussed, those of levitating fruit, grid-aligned snakes that move in alternation, and frames that cannot be rotated, are not inherently interesting, so we must trust that the subject of the game is the journey to mastery itself, the flash of inspiration, the mortal's fleeting experience of oneness with the divine. Unfortunately, this was not my experience."

357490,Astroloco: Worst Contact,"Neat pixel art adventure game that pokes fun at itself and similar adventure games with a moderately fun, British humour. Pretty quick to beat but the content makes it somewhat worth the price. I'm looking forward to a sequel if the dev team comes down to announce it someday."
357600,Unium,"It's a decent puzzle game. Good value. However, after solving all 60 advanced puzzles I didn't even get an achievement so I feel kind of snubbed tbh."

357690,APT,"As someone who loves puzzle platformers i was very excited to play this game, and honestly I think that it might have become the next big thing. Unfortunately once i purchased and played the game for the first few tutorial levels i discovered that the minimalistic design, while maybe an aesthetic decision, was also an indication of what i feel to be an unfinished product. the gameplay was very clunky and the 'tether' hit registration was very poor. to the point where you can watch a video of someone completing a level, then replicate those steps but have something randomly not 'connect' with no indication as to why (shot to high, to low, not close enough, ect...) due to the game offering very little in the way of objects to use as a reference for depth perception. I own plenty of games that i didn’t enjoy, but this is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a review and the first game I have ever just wanted my money back."
357700,Rogue Continuum , Early Access Review
357720,Inside My Radio,"Dissapointing. The fusion of rhythm and platforming could potentially be very interesting (indeed many action games have an underlying tempo) but this developer has not found the proper mix. The biggest issue is that not everything in the world is tied to the beat, so you are sometimes forced interact with elements that are not playing by the same rules you are, which is jarring and frustrating. Most of the game is trivially easy, but those few segments will trip you up. In the end it feels like playing an easy platformer with a hobbled character. The best bits are when you feel a strong rhythm connecting the action with the architechture of the world, but there are not enough of those. Also, the music is generic and mediocre, which really sucks because music is the central theme of the game. Not worth buying, but if you get it in a bundle then check it out for the novelty I suppose."
357750,Damn virgins,"I have never written a 'review' for a game on Steam, but this BS game made me do it! IT MADE ME DO IT!!! :) Ok, now my warning to all the lovers of adventure games, if you want to have fun - do not buy this game, even for the peanuts it is selling on Steam, cause it is not worth even that and you will be disappointed. I personally have requested a refund, thanks god that I did buy it recently and have played for only 22 minutes, during which was bored and annoyed to hell. First of all - even though the game uses Unreal 3 DK, it looks like s**t, assembled from extremely primitive assets by raving 16 y.o. amateurs (at best!). Seems like the same those amateurs are also 'acting' in FMV sequences, which are REALLY trying to be funny, but are not. At least not to adults. The quality of those sequences, as you've guessed already, also c**p. Aside from looking (and playing) really bad with screen tears (cause graphical options are basically nonexistant! }:&gt;) and awkward navigation, all those who do not speak Spanish will be forced to read subtitles, and even if it is not bad per se, and also the info on only spoken language is obviously on the steam page for this game, it kinda makes the whole experience even more dismal than it already is. So, in short, AVOID, if you are not Spanish and have already lost virginity... ;)"
357780,Defend Your Life,"LoL It's cute man, 8/10"
357830,Attack of the Labyrinth +,"The most accurate word to describe this game would be 'basic'. The visuals are basic, the mechanics are basic and the content is basic. It seems fun at first but by the end of the first couple of short levels you will have seen pretty much everything the game has to offer. It's really just a mindless grind through endlessly respawning enemies.  The are many dungeon crawlers on Steam and almost all of them are better than this one. My advice would be to buy Hammerwatch instead; it's a far superior game in every way."
357840,Zombie Camp: Last Survivor,I wish I made this game myself.
357890,Vortex Attack,"One of the most boring games I have played so far. The bullets and enemies are there, but the fun isn't."
357900,Make it indie!,  #LittleLycanOnSteam
357910,QuestEvent,"So far - it's crap. The developer cancelled twice now - irresponsible, at best. Graphics are 8-bit era - which would be okay if their was a good story - which there isn't. So now it's allegedly a 'finished' game - bit only recently reaching version 0.7 or so. If you're interested in this kind of garbage, save your money and buy it if the price drops to $0.10 . I would love it if I felt the developer had any direction in mind, which I don't think there is. But, deep down inside, I really would like to see some substantial work, not just tiny updates every three to six months. My recommendation ? Put it on your wishlist until it's fully developed."
357920,Final Strike, Early Access Review
357930,R.O.O.T.S,"Atmospheric, relaxing and challenging.  The game is very similar to Eufloria if you have played it. You are a tree and you are fighting for little planetoid bubbles which will allow you to propogate your tree and eliminate the other trees.  The challenge revolves around picking the right bubbles and strategically connecting and disconnecting the root sytems to gain the upper hand on each bubble.   The music is relaxing and the colors are pretty.  Very good game for under $5."
357940,Telepath Tactics,"A Fire emblem like game thats quite fun to play, with the possibility to recruit enemy heroes and friendly NPC's in the fight. I suggest trying it, well worth the money if you like Shining Force, Fire Emblem and similar games."
3580,The Wizard's Pen,"This not a HOG in any way. It's well enough presented but only really suitable for young children. The 'Hidden Object' tag should definitely be removed as it's misleading. The game itself is more of a guess-the-unrevealed-object affair which is very simplistic and without depth or any real story. Get it for the youngster if you like but otherwise avoid. It's not terrible, just pointless. 3/10."
35800,BRAINPIPE: A Plunge to Unhumanity,Psychedelic rocks!
358000,The Curse of Nordic Cove,"I almost want to recomment this game just on the bewilderment you'll experience alone. There are some interesting concepts that could make for a fun game. But the execution makes it so it's just not fun enough to justify asking someone to buy, download, and play it. So live vicariously through my video review if you'd like.           YouTube™ Video:  Say Something Nice Reviews Ep. 1: The Curse of Nordic Cove&nbsp;"
358030,Another Star,"&lt;SIGH&gt; It is a real shame, b/c the game has a lot of good ideas, and it's only a few decisions that really screw it up; but I have to give it a thumbs down.  The problem really comes once you get your 2nd party member, &amp; realize that the action choice is for the ENTIRE party. As is item &amp; magic.  That's right... each turn of combat is picking ONE thing the ENTIRE party does, you literally can make ONE decision per turn.  Also, the fight action for both you and the enemy is un-directed, attacks from ea. character/enemy tries to hit every opponent in the combat.  Both of these choices combine to throw almost all tactical depth out the window.   This is the first RPG game I have ever played where getting a 2nd character became a liability... b/c instead of that character giving you an additional tactical choice each turn,  they essentially just become an extra fight attack. An extra attack with its own, lower health bar that you have to waste time with defend/item action to keep alive, sacrificing the attack that could have come for your other, full health hero.  The simple additions of letting you choose an action for each character, and requiring players to choose which enemy/group of enemies to attack,  would have made the experience so much better. As it is the grind is REALLY noticeable, and tactical choice is restricted to knowing to cast the element the enemy is weak to a lot.  I have an inkling that they were trying to mainly imitate the original Dragon Quest... without taking into account that in the original DQ you didn't have a party, and you fought only a single enemy at a time.  Later DQ games, with more player characters, you got to do multiple actions per turn, and you had to decide what enemy you hit with an attack command.  In addition to royally screwing up the battle mechanics, they game cheaps out on having towns you can actually explore. most cases you walk over a town and just get a menu to rest/shop/etc.  I'm just really, really disapointed. The game runs well, they got the aesthetic spot on, the world &amp; story are interesting...  &amp; if they had just put the time in to flesh out mechanics instead of taking shortcuts, ESPECIALLY with the combat, this would be a positive review.  And the changes to the battle mechanics are not, to put it bluntly, rocket science. We're talking basic features present in some of the oldest genre games."
358070,Earthtongue,Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I expected better
358080,No Turning Back: The Pixel Art Action-Adventure Roguelike, Early Access Review
358090,D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die,"So luckily I got this game at greatly reduced price, otherwise I would have been offended by how short this game is Somehow I expected a length like the one of walking dead  but no, it is very short and sadly enough, fails to do anything to the story. I do think the potential is there, but because of the episodes being really short, the storry kind of just doesn't progress. after the few hours I played, I know exactly as much as I did before playing and a second season? well who knows when that happens  and also the cat girl ♥♥♥♥ you! cat girl you have no place in a game like this, go back to the perverted japanese games and stay out of serious ones grrr!"
358130,Curious Expedition,i like it. whatever i have enjoyed playing it and ill likely play it some more. nice feel. lots to figure out.  its got character. the game process is well through out. follows the dan harmon story wheel i think.  Still feels a little big rough. not sure why but still well built.
358170,Arctic Adventure,i'm voting down just because i didn't like this game. i did give it a try. its not i hate platformers just this one didn't do it for me. doesn't bother me it was an old game or controls as some people complained about. its funny how some don't pay attention or expect best controls for older games lol. a lot of them suffered those issues.   anyways if this classic was something you liked when you were younger then grab it now to bring back those memories.
358180,Bio Menace,"Want to go back to the past?  This game, Bio Menace. Is a piece of history made with ID Software's Commander Keen Engine, licensed to Apogee Software, and made somewhat single handedly by ONE FRICKIN' MAN!? (citation needed).  You take control of Snake Logan, yea most cliche-epic-soldier-name EVER! With 3 episodes you are to save the world from the mutants created by a maniac, Cain.  The game itself is stylishly 8-bit and plays awesome and plays very good, and is enchanting. Decent to discover secrets, and SUPER FRICKIN' DIFFICULT HARD MODE! But if you are stuck, you can always cheat. Press down C - A - T on the keyboard at the same time, and you get full auto rifle and 99 grenades to kick more ♥♥♥♥!  Have Fun!"
358190,Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold,"Blake Stone on Steam is just as amazing as I remembered it as a kid. Some updated controls would be great (as seen in titles such as Super 3D Noah's Ark), but it's just as playable as ever."
358200,Math Rescue,10/10 better than infinite warfare
358210,Monster Bash,"One of the worst games I have ever played.  Unavoidable spikes or enemies = good game design, apparently."
358220,Mystic Towers, https://youtu.be/V0IMh6dyMjc   I completely forgot to post my first impression video for Mystic Towers. It's fun! Decent controls and that intro music is amazing! There is a bit of a learning curve and the audio was scratchy (something you get used to from older games).  
358230,Paganitzu,"A puzzle game. And its not a bad game but it has no background music. What you get instead is a beeping sound for each move... Yeah, its really annoying.   Also, some things dont make sense. Apparently, killing a spider with two boulders, turns the bolders into gems."
358250,Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure," One of the more disappointing Apogee games.  The intro steals the ZZ-Top in its own DOS render, but the rest of the music is irrating and repetitive. The gameplay is so jittery. The movent and scrolling feels like 2 frames per second it's hard to see what the f*ck is going on. CTRL to jump and ALT to take a sh*t, basically you run through levels collecting points and jumping on enemies heads. Sounds like Mario, but Mario is 100000 time better.  Meh.  2/10"
358260,Crystal Caves,"This brings me back. It's still a nice game to play after all this years, but do note that it's just DosBox running this game and not a steam version."
358270,Death Rally (Classic),This game became unplayable
358280,Alien Carnage / Halloween Harry,"This game was fun as a kid, nowadays I can't stand it. The weaving back and forth and going back and forth for over 15 minutes to make sure you rescue absolutely everyone and do x and y lever puzzles to open doors etc etc etc it's just too much. It hasn't aged well at all."
358290,Hocus Pocus,"This is one of my all time favourite games so of course I was going to buy it. However, no effort has been put into this - it just runs in DOSbox, which is how I was running it anyway! I foolishly assumed that SOMETHING had been done to it to optimise it for modern machines, but nope. I actually own the original floppy disk of this, so its not like I was even worried about having a legal copy. Ok, £3.99 isn't a lot of money but charging for an DOSbox emulation just seems very lazy"
358300,Major Stryker,"It's a very fun MS-DOS Classic game to play since I was Child.   As for the Storyline, it's painlessly simple: Earth Survives WW3 with most of humanity dead &amp; plauged by a lack of Resources. Then an Alien Race known as the Kretons jump to Earth using a Wormhold and plans to conquer it as if things weren't bad enough. So the call goes out to Major Harrison Stryker, a hero of the Recent World War who takes a Special Attack Starship into the Wormhole to destroy the Kreton Homeworlds on the other side. The Problem is that the Kretons have also taken Human Hostages and you need to free them by ramming into their Holding Cells using your ship since they're immune to Weapon Fire.  With a Total of 24 Levels: 12 Stages &amp; 12 Boss Battles, you'll be blasting the Kretons to Atoms again and again. There's 4 Sectors for each Episode that contains 2 Levels in each Sector &amp; a boss battle for each one:  The Lava Planet contains: The Orbital Station, Water Sector, Land Sector &amp; Lava Sector The Arctic Planet contains: The Arctic Sector, Land Sector, City Sector &amp; Lava Sector The Desert Planet contains: The Orbital Station, Desert Sector, Lava Sector &amp; Tech Sector"
358310,Blake Stone: Planet Strike,"This game works beter than Aliens of Gold, now you can aim with your mouse! Gameplay is still same, new enemies, new levels, must have for any wolfenstein 3D fan!"
358320,Realms of Chaos,"This is an excellent little game from the good old 90s. It involves tight platforming, some really hard (but rarely unfair) bosses and 3 episodes full of fun. It is actually somewhat of a hidden gem in my opinion as the game doesn't only look really good for being that old, but only features some simple and fun gameplay - kill enemies, fight treasure, finish level. It's addicting and sadly all too short but well worth the money."
358330,Pharaoh's Tomb,"Game looks bad, but once you are playing it, it becomes fun and addicting!"
358340,Word Rescue,"what can i say about the genre defining, pinnacle of excellence that is Word Rescue? from the emergent story telling and world building, and exploration of a deep rich environment to the fast paced streamlined combat and the nail biting suspense, this game truly has something for everyone to enjoy. while most games trying to juggle so many tasks would become bogged down, the simplicity of its design is a wonder to behold. i can go from seeking out riches in a desert snake den, to tracking down missing valuables in a run down industrial district without even noticing a change in gameplay. the pace is unrelenting, but varied enough to keep the game from being tiring, constantly switching between the satisfying combat, and the provocative puzzle solving that will lead you not only to understand more about the world, but also to understand more about yourself. there was nothing like it before, and nothing hereafter will compare, we can only be glad that we received this gem when we needed it most. but then i may be a bit nostalgic"
358350,Secret Agent,"Horrible sound, enemies can shoot you trough walls and you die by a single bullet. Jumping into water also kills you..."
358360,Raptor: Call of the Shadows (1994 Classic Edition),Great game! Definitely a classic. So happy I found it on steam.
358370,Terminal Velocity,"Favorite part is that it looks nothing like a DOS game at all, but rather better..."
358390,Stargunner,"This is literally the first video game i've ever played, so nostalgia is gonna bias me quite a bit. I've spent a lot of time trying to get this game to work by other means, so seeing it working properly on steam is quite a relief.   This game is pretty much exactly the same as when it was released, haven't noticed any bugs as of yet, and it seems to run smoothly. It's a hard sidescrolling space shooter, with 3 different terrains and 3 different difficulties."
358400,Shadow Warrior (Classic),A classic! It's still rather good. Controls are a pain as you would expect but you do get used to them after a while.  Don't mess with the Wang!  (first impression video)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5pCdGAx5FQ 
358410,Rise of the Triad: Dark War,Does this game have an in-game map?? And if so how do you view it??
358420,Xenophage,Pros:  Cool music Uninstall button works  Cons:  Basically everything else
358440,Dark Ages, Another neat Apogee game with only one life and no continues.  Couldn't figure out what to do with the key on the first screen and never passed it.  3/10
358650,Gryphon Knight Epic,"With hitbox resizing, the ability to move in one direction while shooting in another, and some difficulty adjustments, Gryphon Knight Epic could be an okay game. As it stands, it's a messy medieval hodgepodge that you'd be better off avoiding at all costs.   Save yourself some money by instead buying some feathers and a fake beak and putting them on your dog.  Read my full review here:  http://www.destructoid.com/review-gryphon-knight-epic-307100.phtml "
358700,3d Bridges,"Badly produced game. Don't bother buying. The controls are all over the place, the camera and building systems are awful and it is hard to follow some of the tutorials."
358750,Sunrider: Liberation Day - Captain's Edition,Fairly good game. My only complaint is that the voice overs are in japanese. This is a distressing trend the video game developers are falling into mainly thanks to the inconsiderate purists. There are plenty of gamers out there that don't speak japanese and hate subtitles...
358760,Selenon Rising,"Finished the first episode. IT wasn't... *bad*, but it didn't have anything to it that made it stand out as *good*.   * Interrogation mechanics cribbed from Ace Attorney and Danganronpa, but not as entertaining as either.  * Interesting setting that you don't get to explore or learn much about.  * Plot that changes gears from a crime procedural to a spy drama to some kind of shonen-y thing without warning.  * All artwork that isn't character portraits seems underdeveloped.   I guess I just wasn't hooked."
358770,The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 - Prelude,I`m sorry but when you can`t make some choices it`s not a game IMO....
358810,Luckslinger,"I tried, but goddam this game sucks"
358840,ZombieRun,"This game is actually pretty cool! Something different! 6,9/10"
358960,Canabalt,"This is my favorite infinite runner. Lots of options, great music."
3590,Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year,"Fortunately I can play the game on my desktop and I must say I absolutely love it. Unfortunately it won't run on my laptop and I can't find any support for this issue anywhere. It seems like it won't run in full screen mode. But you can't adjust the settings unless you're in the game, which won't open because the default settings don't work. They made the settings and the license file the same file so if you change it the game errors on opening.  So I'm torn. Yes I recommend this game. It is a ton of fun IF you can get it running. I'm noting my recommendation as 'No' in hopes of garnering a support response."
359040,The Music Machine,Was really into this until it decided 'Oh this girl lied about being molested cuz she was rejected' was a plot point it wanted to go with as tho that's totally a thing kids do. It's honestly super ♥♥♥♥ing disrespectful of CSA victims.
359050,Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015: Do You Still Shower With Your Dad,It's ok
359060,Switch Galaxy Ultra,"Played a few minutes, the stutters and lag were bad enough that I wouldn't want to spend anymore time on it. The game would appear to freeze, but would continue to progress.  Intel i7 4790k stock speeds watercooled Nvidia GTX 970 16GB DDR3 2400 ram 480GB SSD"
359070,Hunter Gatherer,"You know that thing you get in 3d games where you have a detailed object with crisp textures laying on a blobbish texel smear of some large-scale background? This is that, in a 2D game. Every sprite has a different DPI on screen, it feels like.  Also the text apparently only looked good on the original testing resolution; it scales badly.  Retro or 'low-quality' art is fine, just see undertale or nidhogg. The random inconsistancy is what kills it.  The controls are kinda sticky, at least in switching to movement to the right.  I didn't get much past the stew, but other reviews seem to indicate that I've already seen about half the game. Short games are fine, but...  The writing is also slightly off. Not bad-bad, but if you're putting something up for sale... try to get someone with at least a slight college level expereince in proofing and copyediting to go over it -- someone who didn't write it. Given the amount of text between the game, the website, and steam itself, I'd guess that's maybe a half hour's work.   The less text you have the more important it is to get it right.  All in all it looks like a good first finished game project from a new dev, but I just keep asking myself, why is it on steam?"
359090,Gare Sapphire Mechs,"the mouse lags more than a down syndrome kid lags behind in class, i could run GTA V on my grandmother's typewriter better than i can run this on a pc"
359140,Kick Ass Commandos,"What I thought would be a spiritual successor to Cannon Fodder turned out to be a very dull 'bullet-hell' esque game, minus the things that make bullet hell games fun.  The game itself is very repetitive, and the missions are all basically 'shoot this way until all enemies in this direction die and then you get this other powerup so you can go shoot in this direction until it is time to ride a helicopter out of here'  Pass."
359160,TAKEN,"not worth it, i want my 2 bucks back ♥♥♥♥head. it lags way to much and i get it to stop and but wait the game itself lags like non stop making it hard to move but when i go back to the main menu everything is peachy till i play the damn game"
359190,Rituals,i like the menu music :)
359220,MX vs. ATV Unleashed,"I used to love this game on the ps2, however this version dose not work on modern machines (even win 7 and XP) every time I try to load a level the game crashes. I only paid $2.50 for it so I'm not to mad, but take my advice and don't buy it. Oh and devs (if you even read these) please up date the game even a small patch to try and fix the problem would be nice."
359230,Lethis - Path of Progress,"Nice job bringing to life games like this one, reminds me the old ones.   Not like the classics but still fun. Changing my recommendation since they fixed the bugs."
359250,City of Fools,"This game is fun and will ♥♥♥♥ you off at the same time. It's one of those i can't stop til i find that next item and then you find one you didn't need and then you have to fig out where it goes. Lol  All in all if you like fun, tourture adn puzzles this is the game for you."
359260,Green Moon,  This is a waste of time. Not worth the money.
359280,Heroes of Loot,"Something is wrong with the speed (pace of the game), the camera and player move too fast to be enjoyable, I can't really explain but feels cheap design."
359300,Death Pirate,What is this game and how do I play it??? The dialogue was about 15 minutes at the start (I skipped it and it was still long). I wouldn't mind if it was actually intresting. I would reccomend this if more effort went into this but this is like a school project.
359310,Evoland 2,What an amazing experience. This is a true love letter to gaming. It took me about 22 hours to complete almost everything. I loved the variety of game types and while it was not easy at times (like the games it emulates) it was always fair and possible to move forward. This one will stick with me for a long time as a great gaming experience.
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Original Post:   This is one of the most beautiful and amazing games I've ever played. The combat is EPIC. The Ships will blow you away. Sorry for being so emotion, however, the pure emotion this game illicits makes it hard to explain tangibly how great Elite Dangerous is. . .   Grammer errors for being lysdexic with frozen fingers.  Updated Post:  Frontier developed a great game. Then they added additional complexity before truly making a great game into a master piece. Then they failed to impliment the added complexity in a way that added value to the game. Then they added further complexity and realism. The realism came at the cost of FUN. Imagine playing original Battlefield again but this time feeling how the soliders fielt landing on Normandy. More often than not Realism != Fun.   So today we play a game called Elite Dangerous Horizons.  1. This game technically allows for you to play with your friends, however, offers very shallow multiplayer mechanics. 2. The game allows you to modify your engines, shields, weapons, etc. beyond simply upgrading them, however, makes the modification 100% based on luck. Without the add of websites and forums you must hope that you find the right NPC drops and Mission Rewards to modify an item the way you want and then you must hope that the game mechanic randomly chooses the modification you want with the stats you want -- this is literally like creating a character in DnD and rolling the dice to choose your starting stats and abilities. 3. The PVP mechanics punish you FAR more than they reward you. You literally can lose EVERYTHING you've worked hard to earn and achieve over hundreds of hours due to a simple and stupid mistake or death.  4. Often after an update you can spend 2 to 3 months learning about the new mechanics before being able to go back to playing the game. Imagine learning to ride a bike with training wheels. Its pretty exciting to take those training wheels off. Then imagine being forced to switch to a unicycle in the middle of a career making race at the olympics. The kicker is that the NPC's are still riding bicycles while you are learning how to ride a unicylce. NOW put a target on your back and give them all automatic weapons. Don't worry, you get a trusty revolver from the wild west. Do not worry about the fact that everyone else gets automatic weapons. Things will work out fine, I promise. . ."
359350,Defunct,"Nice piece of game. Mechanisms are totally original and fun to play. However I feel confused all the time. Given it's an adventure game it's not necessarily a bad thing, but I found myself picking the easy routes all the time because 1) the fast routes are generally too difficult and require a ton of trial&amp;error 2) I weren't even sure if those are the right ways because map's too open-worldly. It's really a beautiful and delicate world. It'd be nice if I didn't feel defeated all the time."
359370,Pirate's Life,Cool simple gameplay but thats it nothing more nothign less shame really
359390,Amnesia™: Memories,someone teach these boys how to dress  
359400,Why Am I Dead At Sea,"All things considered, this is a good story. I say 'story' rather than 'game' because I think there's this notion going around that a video game has to have gameplay. This doesn't. You interact with the world and the characters through a set of mechanics, but it's more a storytelling device than a game.  There were things I didn't like. The supernatural angle didn't end up being particularly relevant. It only provided a way within the context of the story for the player to interact with the world. I'd have like to see it taken further. There are a couple of optional scenes in which the player character uses their ghostly powers to help a character conquer their personal demons from within. I wanted to see more of that, but then the game ended.  If you've played Capcom's  Ghost Trick  - and you should - I'd compare this game to it as shorter, less interesting, with a less satisfying ending. But it is more grounded, which can be seen as a good thing, depending on whether you think the supernatural element clashes or not.  All that said, if you ever have an urge for a murder mystery thriller story with a supernatural framing device, this game is what you're looking for."
359440,Artifact Adventure,"Growing up, my grandparents had an NES. The squat gray box had been kicked out of my house after my father got addicted to Mario, and so I only got to see it on the rare occasions that I stayed over with my grandparents. It had quite a game library, too, since my mother had bought the console originally to play a few RPGs.  One of the games in the library was Final Fantasy.  I didn't really understand it at first. I'd load my inventory up with armor and then be puzzled when spiders took down my team with ease. I'd buy tons of weapons, but no one's damage would increase. I was utterly convinced that Blackbelts were the only good class in the game.  After a few lukewarm experiences with getting murdered by imps in the woods, I decided to leave it alone. I played Megaman and Star Tropics and had a grand time while it gathered dust on the shelf. Until one day when something finally clicked.  'Equip screen?' I wondered. 'What's that about?'  What followed was an afternoon of the weirdest, most serene bliss I had ever felt.  Now, I tell that story because it's the easiest way to describe the effect that Artifact Adventure had on me when I booted it up. From the first menu, I felt like I had somehow stumbled back into that same insulating bubble of warmth and sound and small cups of instant butterscotch pudding. I don't usually like the nostalgia games market, but I'll make an exception for any game that can make me feel like I'm back in my grandmother's old house again.  I'm not sure I can do an unbiased review for this game, but if you ever had similar experiences, you might want to give Artifact Adventure a try."
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Ok game but horrible fps a PS4 game being played on a pc not a good balance in game play. players constantly run in front of you to get a kill so you get kicked a lot for tk's. PS4 players have a great atvantage in game with their contorl and speed, in multiplayer there is a lot of hacking one shot head shots from across the map while players run and snap shoot. Very limited maps and missions. The game is set up to get you to buy their boosters, coins, reputation, gun skins and toon skins uniforms and heaggear. You can get some of these things without spending real coin but it will take you a very long time to earn enough exp. There is also guite a bit of glitching which will sometimes cause crashing of the game, when this happens you will get a notice asking if you wish to send in the crash report to ubisoft thei   s happens often the they give you the option to never receive the crash report message. It is ok if you are a PS4 player but I cannot reccomen this for a PC player."
359560,Shutter,"Ok, this review is going to be as short as the game, so brace yourself for the following tweet.  Games like this, where a new mechanic is introduced such as the drone aspect of it, are definitely a breath of fresh air nowadays, when its done right. This is not entirely the case with Shutter. I mean, I liked the game mechanics and what was aiming for but as many other games, it felt short. I think that a longer and more polished experience could have made a great game, but with current state of it, it just comes off as an ok game that is too short and has a lot of bugs, no glitches though."
359580,Uncanny Valley,"Too easy and too hard at the same time. You can get all important stuff that you need trough simple search in apartments -- that's EZ.  Once you are trapped with an enemy, your only choice to get damaged until you die. After that you can't restart, because you get to an ending. -- that's too hard.  I did enjoy the atmosphere of the facility and these surreal dreams. I certanly got scared, but I wasn't satisfied by disability to replay it from the place where I failed it, so I can't recommend it."
359600,Assassin’s Creed® Chronicles: Russia,"Pretty good game, has some hard parts that aquire some mindwork. Challenging gameplay"
359610,Assassin’s Creed® Chronicles: India,Pretty good 2d stealth game. Most interesting plot and settings of all the chronicles games.
359620,Call of Cthulhu: Prisoner of Ice,"Although it has some references to the Cthulhu Mythos, this garbage of an adventure game does not deserve to be associated with the works of H.P. Lovecraft. If you enjoy pixel-hunting and illogical puzzles, give it a go.   'The Freeze-and-Destroy' - give me a break!"
359630,Independence War 2: Edge of Chaos,"The plot is interesting at first but I do have to admit the tutorial for controls, what little there is, is terrible. When it doesn't even tell you how to switch back and forth between missiles and guns or even HOW to target the nearest enemy....frankly the interface and the game itself was good for it's time, but that was a while ago."
359650,Star Trek™: 25th Anniversary,"atmospheric and cozy... for trekkies is a real diamond... well, dilithium, to be true)"
359670,Vagrant Hearts 2,"Vagrant Hearts 2 is a pretty good side view turn based RPG. It plays the same as the first game. The unique but sometimes annoying magic crest system is still here as well as the frequent party member changes.  I came into this sequel not expected much difference from the first game and that's exactly what I got.  This game follows the same storyline right after the first game, but nothing else has changed with the gameplay or graphics. One of the unique features of the first game was the Rojak Fragments which were hidden throughout the world and added replay in the quest to find them all. This game however, has no side quests like that, or at all.  Basically, this is a rather generic but fun turn-based RPG, with rather ugly dark graphics, bad and forgettable dialogue, and ugly character design. The usual limitations of an RPG maker game remain here as well, which means no broadcasting, screenshots, overlay, or chatting with your friends without the use of alt-tab.  The gameplay is the saving grace here, as I enjoyed the battles much as I did in the previous version.  This is one of the better RPG maker games and one of the better developers."
359800,Copa Petrobras de Marcas,For free and what it is I find it frnaklyu maazing. It does storngly remidn me of Rfactor however from what I have played of it I have loved it. It ofcourse doesn't have much to do BUT it is free so what do you expect?

359870,FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"AH HA HA HA HA HA HA.  And that, as they say, is that."
359900,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,"I will be honest I am not sure where some of these reviews are concluding that is this a bad game. Over my 8 hours playtime I had no crashes at all, the game ran beautifully. The setting and environments were interesting, the story is nicely tied together and closed in this game, and the gameplay was satisfying enough for me. I played as the Umbralist (I played a ranged hero in VH1, and a melee one in VH2) and did not have any of the power creep problems with enemies that I had in VH1. I definitely agree with others though that the skill trees seem to be vastly reduced from VH2, but I still found enough variety to keep my class entertaining throughout. There is a sea of features within your home base that I only scratched the surface of (most returning from VH2).  My personal issues with the game were so few and frankly irrelevant that they did not impact my opinion of the game at all. While maybe not as expansive as VH2 this on its own is by no means a bad game like others are making it out to be. Especially if you consider this was made by a studio with probably 25% of the budget that Diablo has. Pick it up if you can get it on sale and therefore cheaply. I would recommend trying this series out if you are looking for something a bit different from Diablo or Torchlight, or are interested in the steampunkish / macabre settings."
359920,Highlands,"I dont like it, it is too random gameplay and. Could have been great but its not."
359940,Shadows Peak, Early Access Review
359960,Choice Chamber,"Okay so love the game but i dontlove a few things about it, Things I love: 1. Interaction on point 2. Lots of interaction 3. Easy to connect to twitch 4. Did i mention the interaction?! Like seriously amazing game for twitch interaction and i absolutley love it. However there is one huge detracting feature i can not stand I HAD SOMEONE GLOBAL BANNED thats right because someone decided to start spamming my chat with different choices for the bomb dropping to blow through the floor they got globally banned on twitch for 20 hours! Now we did get him his privalages back pretty quickly it doesnt matter if im going to have to repeatedly stop my stream to help someone out cause they wanted to have fun and i need to send another twitch help email it becomes a very detracting feature of the game. I would give a thumbs up if this wasnt a thing."
360,Half-Life Deathmatch: Source,"A game made at a time when Valve felt the sky was the limit with the Source engine  So they made this and everyone was like, 'Why?'"
3600,Escape Rosecliff Island, Nothing Special
36000,Foreign Legion: Buckets of Blood,"I loved this game... when I was eleven. It's not a very good game in general. It's not polished, the music is bad, it's too easy, and it's repetitive. There are some bugs you might be able to push through but overall the game feels like it's in some sort of alpha version. It feels more like an idea than an entire game.  Would not recommend unless you are easily entertained."
360010,Remnants of Isolation,"  A short but fun RPG. The graphics are colourful, the music is nice! You have two main characters and the girl is silent. She gives enough expression to still make the conversations interactive. A lot of the background story is unfolded by finding notes around the castle.  The battle system is very neat. You have to use the characters together. One to power up and the other to use a spell. Combining different of their abilities causes unique effects. So you have to strategize wisely.  A very interesting game so definitely recommended!"
360030,XLarn,"Sorry, this game, even at five bucks, is too rich for my blood.  I get it -- it's a nostalgic look at the past. Here's the thing:  When I was a kid, my first computer was a TRS-80. Many people reading this might not know about the TRS-80 so let me describe it.  The year was 1978. The TRS-80 was black and white, had the type of monitor that -- well, it was the stone age of computers, if that makes sense. The memory size? 4k. That's K. Four-thousand bytes. That's it. You could upgrade to the TRS-80 Level II and this took you to a memory size of 16k.  What's that, you ask? How did programs get loaded into the memory? Floppy disk? LOL, seriously, Silly Rabbit. There were tape drives. That's right, cassette tapes. And a game like 'Asylum' could take fifteen to twenty minutes to load. And if the volume was too high on the cassette player? NO GAME FOR YOU, RELOAD. If the tape was old and the tape player kicked off in the middle of loading? There were these flashing asterisks in the upper right corner of the screen and if there was an **E* for error -- time to load it again. NO GAME FOR YOU, RELOAD.  One of the first games I had (and I loved) was Dancing Demon. Check it out here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNT7nVOugTM   Another of my favorite games? The Temple of Apshai. WHich you can see here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiMtY5BxdM0   So let me explain -- the actual descriptions of a the rooms, you had to look them up in a manual. That's right, memory was so precious that the programmers couldn't even put the descriptions of the rooms in the programming.  Finally, check out another one of my favorites --Scarfman. I got this for Christmas in 1980:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIUxmqe3jA4   Okay, so this gives you a little background about XLarn.  How did computer games come about? Basically, there were bored graduate students who needed a break from keying in punch cards into the mainframe. What's a punch card? Basically, each card was a line of code. You stacked them all together, perhaps two or three hundred cards, and you would stack them in a reader that would load them, one after the other, into the computer. Check it out here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se0F1bLfFKY   Okay, so what's the point?  The point is that no matter how nostalgic you feel about something, don't let the feeling separate you from your money. In case you didn't know, the word nostalgia includes the Greek root for 'pain' -- alg.  Why did I want to experience a game like this? This game proves that if you take a forty year-old game which essentially was made by bored graduate students to see them through the wee hours of the morning -- well, you can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.  No matter how nostalgic you might feel about those days and these days, don't spend your money. $5 is way way WAY too much to pay for something that people that was cool before there were video arcades. There have to be so free versions somewhere on the web. And if there aren't -- well, you don't need it that bad anyway.  One of the reasons that people liked games as they evolved and as the computers changed to meet the wants of the public -- there began to be this concept of 'Saving' progress. People now talk about these kinds of adventures being rogue-like. If this is what you could classify this as, then all I have to say is that rogue-like adventures p*ss me the f*ck off. And the more suspicious I get that any modern developer creates a game as rogue-like to distract the gamer from a lack of depth and content.  What's a way to keep people playing? Well, you could basically provide them with a sh*t-ton of stuff to do. Or you could have death be permanent and make the gamer start over. Which is cheaper to make?  The little boy in me misses the days of 'Dancing Demon' and 'Crush, Crumble, and Chomp'. But the adult in me, you would think, would be smart enough to understand that, just as Thomas Wolfe wrote, you can't go home again.  Well, here's the sad fact -- we're all getting older and marking time waiting for that ultimate moment that all mortals must face. We're getting older and fatter. And no matter how much you want it, you can't get that feeling back, even for $5."
360040,Our Nation's Miner,"I'm a sucker for neon glowing stuff, but its UI is mess and in it's current state it is sadly unplayable. Add tutorial, add possibility to dump only part of material, make it possible to switch different info screen without closing previous one. Looking back on how much time it was spent to make it look gorgegous, waste a tiny bit more to make itplayable? Please?"
360150,How To Survive Third Person,"Noob Game Ever 4/10 Same as how to survive but change to third person. This game is hard for me because zombie is too many for weak weapon and we need the food, water and safezone for sleep at night (zombie at night is very strong) to survival. Some zombie is so OP. When it come with group of normal zombie I cant kill them.  Range weapon in this game is very weak but melee weapon is ok for me  I like the killing action, skill tree, crafting and world map it very cool."
360170,How to Survive 2,"'How to Survive 2' is a top down, zombie horde, survival/crafting game published by 505 games. It contains RPG elements including quests, experience, and a skill system. The game allows for online and local multiplayer with up to 4 players. Base Building and defense is also a key part of the game.  FOR ME GAME HAVE : excellent graphics excellent gameplay and effects good sound and music story is good ... Medium world with a lot of action ------------------------------ worth money and time highly recommend this game !  "
360380,Tiny Bridge: Ratventure,Game is not very bad but it´s waaaaaaaaaayyyyyy worse then World of Goo.Buy World of Goo!!!.Tiny Bridge is worth on a mega sale for like 2 dollars or less The physics of this game is very cool but....  -Lacks charm -not funny -bad graphics -terrible music -atrocious sound effects  overall 5/10

360430,Mafia III: Definitive Edition,"I got this 2 hours before the fps and control patch came through. I didnt so much find the 30fps terrible but with unlimited fps it is far superior. I enjoy the games look quite a bit and have no complaints with the overall fidelity of the graphics, they work and often I find myself really just taking my time and enjoying my surroundings.  The car mechanics work for me as well, they have weight and slide and its all very actiony and I like that.  Gun play also has weight and its satisfying to watch arms fly back when hit or someone crumple into a bag of flesh when hit in the midsection with a shotgun.   Ive only unlocked 2 rackets so far but I also enjoy this as well, theres some repitition here but theres a fair bit of fluff story to go along with each one and its satisfying to take down the enemies in this.  The music is really great, alot of fantastic songs I grew up listening to as a child are well used here and tie into the story in a great way, really hitting that nostalgia factor.   The overall story and presentation is really great, alot of likable characters and excellent voice acting.  Do i recommend this game, yes, is it for everyone, no.  If you can enjoy driving around a city and taking in the sights, satisfying gunplay and the grind to unlock rackets then ya get this game- there is a fair amount of satisfaction in alot of what you do and unlike alot of open world games it all makes sense, your expanding your territory in your mission."
360450,Kiai Resonance,Ken-sama the game.  You are not truWeeb unless you own and play this game and train on it everyday until you go to Japan. 
360510,Into the Stars,"This game tried its best to be like FTL, but nothing can beat FTL. When i first got this game i played it and beat it in 2 hours time. I wis the game was longer, but sadly it isnt. The devs worked on it and left with a preactically unfinished game. since then I havent touched this game or played it. If your looking into a game thats like FTL, you wont find it here."
360520,Hypt,"I really wish steam had a 'neutral' button. I didn't want to give this game a bad review; this game is pretty fun, with nice graphics and a soundtrack that you don't immediately mute. Unfortunately, I can only reccomend this game with the following disclaimer:  This game SCREAMS for dual joystick input. Like Geometry Wars, and all of the Gauntlet games that have come out since dual joystick gamepads became a thing, this game is best played on a pair of joysticks. Therein lies the rub; there is no gamepad support for this game- you have to play with a keyboard and mouse. You will have to control your sphere-thingie's fluid and graphically seamless 360 degrees of motion with a clunky and limited four buttons. If this will be a problem for you I don't reccomend this game, this is a pretty good game otherwise though."
360530,WE ARE DOOMED,"I love this game! Don't be put off by the average review score from other platforms. Main complaints are from lack of variety game modes that only include endless mode and 30 wave stages. I don't think this is worth the full price but wait for sale. You can get Geometry Wars Retro Evolved for half the price but I do recommend We Are Doomed.  I love the graphics, art style and gameplay. Your laser weapon is limited in distance and that makes it more challenging. You also get a secondary weapon by collecting enough cubes (Trinkets) to enable your superbeam weapon. The enemies don't go down easily with one shot kill and depending on which enemies it takes more hit points to kill.  I recommend this for all Twin Stick Shooters fans."
360550,Cursed Sight,"Good lord, what a terrible game! The plot is predictable (except when all logic flies out the window), the characters are bland, and it felt like it was written by a middle schooler. Because I backed this on Kickstarter I only paid $3 for it, and I still feel ripped off. Go somewhere else for your visual novel itch."
360580,Abduction Action! Plus,It's alright. Took me an hour to beat everything and get all achievements.
360590,"Once Bitten, Twice Dead","You can see, by the other reviews, how bad this can be. But, well, confirming it: It is a lot. Really bad game, really clunky, really out of purpose and really no fun at all  And here you really don't have a purpose, things don't make that much of a sense, you have to guess what to do, where to go, what to get, and face the zombies that appear out of nowhere.  The game is laggy for simple graphics like that. I had fewer problems with some other games that look like it (you know THAT one) that is more compelling and works better than this.   So yeah, stay away from this.  By the way, your character is probably a vampire, since you can't enter some houses."
360600,99 Waves to Die,"Hard decision... I really like twin stick shooters but this one is way too shallow, mediocre players spot the loophole within minutes and it evolves into a game of patience... not a good and demanding game"

Even in moments after repeated match losses, when I am yelling at the gods of gaming, fists clenched &amp; shaking at the sky, wads of hair stuck in between fingers, yes frustrated beyond rational discourse--even then, at the bottom of the abyss, I love Cards and Castles. I continue to learn so much about solid strategy. Fantastic game--"
360740,Downwell,I would recommend this game.

360870,Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe,"As an avid Tic-Tac-Toe player with countless years of experience I've found that this iteration of Tic-Tac-Toe is nothing short of blasphemous. It does not follow the official tournament rules and the game is rigged in favor of the O's. I'm very displeased with my purchase of this product!  Prepare yourselves for a lawsuit!  With regards, Scottsbluff's Tic-Tac-Toe champion of '88"
360880,Nightfall: Escape, Early Access Review
360890,The Lost Valley,"Nice relaxing game  Needs a bit of polishing: menu, options, key binding"
360940,The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare,A regular shooter from the 3rd person perspective except that instead of blood there is plasic and there are scattered toys instead of war zone obstacles. Would recommend it for those who have a good taste for sillyness.
360990,Ongaku,"At first I thought the game was too kiddy...but then realized it's (personally) a good change of pace. It just means you can recommend this game to literally anyone at any age.  The difficulty curve is quite interesting. Easy mode is indeed a breeze, but on Normal, it becomes something you have to watch out. This doesn't mean it's an unreasonable difficulty spike though; on the contrary, it feels just right. Normal is supposed to be...well, 'normal', so you ought to spend at least some time getting used to the gameplay first, and then have fun with it later. I haven't played on Hard yet, but looking at how much value Normal mode gives, I have no doubt it will give me a good time as well.  If there's anything to complain about, I'd say the arrows are a bit difficult to see, but changing the skin fixed that problem quite nicely; it actually improves my performance switching from skin to skin as well, so I recommend buy the DLC packs if you're interested in purchasing this game. Don't worry, they're worth it."
3610,Mystery P.I.: Lost in Los Angeles,"A decent little hidden object game. The puzzles included in each level are repetitive and just feel like an impediment keeping you from the actual game. The final match three puzzle is a complete mess. Nearly unsolvable, it caused the game to freeze. I had to go back to the main menu several times before I found a board that I could solve. The game overall is enjoyable, but that final puzzle ruined my experience."
361020,Luxor HD,"There are a few newer Luxor-games, but I didn't like them. This one is very good though."
361040,Doom & Destiny Advanced,The sheer numbers being tossed around by random mobs is insane. I regularly lose a character in combat because he will finish off an enemy and then three enemies all target him back-to-back killing him.   Don't bother spending resources to heal your party; You're far better off just dying and respawning since you lose nothing when you do.  Every single battle is a slog that drains more resources than it should.  Throughout the game there are treasures and areas you can't access unless you trudge back to a respawn point and swap out your classes and then trudge back.  I loved the first Doom &amp; Destiny but gave up during the fight with Death in this one (in chapter 3). Death did a cold attack that slowed my party and then had so many turns so quickly that he just killed everyone far too quickly for me to do anything about it.   Alt-F4. Won't play this again.
361130,Card Dungeon,"Card Dungeon is a virtual board game in which the player navigates a series of dungeons killing monsters and collecting treasures.   Good points: + Nice, neat graphical style with varied dungeon graphics. + Smooth and (at least on my play-through) bug-free. + Music is simple, but fun and non-intrusive. + Cheap (particularly if you pick it up in a Sale)  Bad points - Way too easy (completed everything and collected enough gems to unlock everything on my first proper game). - Totally linear and lacking any secrets or similar (at least that I found) - Becomes a bit repetitive. - No replay value.  Overall I would (just about) recommend it, if you are looking for a cheap and simple game to waste a few hours without taxing your brain. Not likely to present much of a challenge to adult players however and you'll be unlikely to touch it again once you have played it through.  "
361160,Steamalot: Epoch's Journey,"Interesting strategy/card building game, a bit on the repetitive side."
361190,Sparkle 3 Genesis,Previous games were better - and less stressful. I had to look for help online on the third or fourth level - only to get stuck on the very next level.
361200,Coast Guard,"Rubbish game, dont buy it. With a good GPU i get terrible frame rate and the story is just crap"
361250,Strange Space, Early Access Review
361280,Turmoil,"So I'm editing my review which had prevoiusly been not to recommend this game; however, after revisiting the game and unlocking Expert mode many of my problems with the game are greatly aleviated.   I also recommend buying all of the Mayors Tips to find out more about the various strategies of the game.  My previous complaint still stands though that the end of the game essentially comes down to  1.) Have more money than everyone else (not a problem because the AI starts blowing everything at the end over small stock percentages) 2.) Don't be in last place in buying shares of the town at the end. 3.) Start buying shares early.  Following those 3 rules makes it almost impossible to lose unless you completely mismanage you upgrades and oil rigs through the game."
36130,Tradewinds Caravans,I like this game and the other game as well but am trying to reinstall them to my comp and having trouble finding how to do so
361300,Mother Russia Bleeds,Friend came over and we played thru the campaign in one sitting. Had some laughs and overall a decent game. I felt my blood pressure rising but was worth it. Don't recommend playing the game in one sitting for safety reasons.  7/10 Needs more control over blocking and dodging and could use a bit better up and down movement system. (sometimes feels like your right on top of a dude but you cant hit him because you are 1 pixel above/below him but somehow end up getting dropkicked in the jaw.)
361320,Casino Inc,"EDIT: also the original was published by koei so im not sure who allowed this publisher to put this game on steam. i really hope its legally bound, this game needs to be on steam.   im sure the person who posted this is not hothouse, so not expecting any patches or bug fixes, however it is in need of some.   That being said it is still a very very good game. thanks for bringing this game to steam. nothing has ever come close to it."
361330,Shrooms, Early Access Review
361350,Skyhook,"  OVERALL RATING: 4/5  My opinion of this game has slightly changed over time, but nonetheless this game is still fun as heck to play with a group of friends!  I'll just go over everything in this game individually.  Versus Mode: 5/5 This is the main gamemode of Skyhook, and it's the best part of the game. You play using grappling hooks, which can be used to move around and attack. You can also melee to knock hooks away and to attack as well. The physics in this game are fantastic, and the gameplay is fast. The items that randomly pop in don't feel overpowered but they don't feel useless either.   Quest Mode: 3/5 People definitely seem to have mixed opinions on this mode, and I can see why. It's not especially fun, and sometimes easy difficulty levels can be so much more difficult when all the enemies shoot you at the same time. That being said quest mode is a good way to challenge yourself if you feel like you've mastered the game, and beating certain levels well enough unlocks new character skins.  Characters: 4.5/5 At the time of writing this review there are 5 playable characters. The only difference between characters is how they dodge, which is good, because huge character ability diversity could cause one character to be picked more than others for their usefulness. The characters themselves feel unique, and each one has a very creative design. Originally the developer planned at launch to have 3 unlockable characters, but at the time of this review it's only one, which is my only problem with this game's characters.  Overall, this game is fun to play with friends, and is definitely worth getting considering it's low price."
361360,Goosebumps,This game is awesome!! If you love 90's point and click adventure games then you'll love this
361380,World War I,HORRIBLE. atleast add a sandbox mode where we can build stuff and train people like age of empires!!
361430,The Little Crane That Could,the guy was to fat to get in the little crane       nothing to see here mate!  
36150,Westward,"Although it looks to be intended for a yonger crowd, it is a fun time killer.  I have not yet tried the third installment but i¨m lokking forward to it.  the second game had evolved in mechanik and graphick and rises my expektations for the third one. collorfull characters keeps popping up and keeps the game alive, and it may not be as easy as it seems at first glance If you like casual games this is a very good buy.   "
361550,Cradle,"The game was ok, I feel it had so much potential but doesnt quite get there. The world is amazing and beautiful &amp; the story is very interesting, but you dont actually explore much of the world, and the story by the end felt rushed, it just ends, which sucks because it was just getting interesting, which brings me to the other issue, the game is very very short.  The puzzles, were ok-ish again, not really the best part of the game for sure, they get annoying, luckily you can just skip them if you dont care for them.  Having said all that, I still liked the game, I hope the devs continue Enebish's &amp; Ida's story theres so much more we dont know about these two."
361560,Ice Cream Surfer,"Controls? Please? Like, why is my enter the A button? xD And why can't I change the controls? xD But..it's pretty good graphics..really, I would really really love if I could control the characters and play with the right buttons, but until then it's a thumbs down c:"

361670,STAR WARS™: X-Wing Alliance™,"Multiplayer doesn't work. Tried a lot of things like port forwarding in the router and allowing through windows firewall but no success.  Edit: Finally got MP to work by going through Game Ranger. The game itself is lots of fun, now that I can actually play it!"
361690,STAR WARS™ X-Wing vs TIE Fighter: Balance of Power Campaigns™,"  Copy was received for free from a bored friend;  Excellent feel to the flying, targeting, and power management systems.

361850,Portal of Evil: Stolen Runes Collector's Edition,"This is another great HO/point and click game. If you are fan of the genre I would definitely recommend this. You play as Vanessa, trying to find several “seals” that seal off a door which prevents evil from entering the world. Not a ground breaking story, but it’s told well and I was into it. There are a solid number of cutscenes to move the story along.    The puzzles and overall point &amp; click part of the game is very well done. The puzzles are not too difficult but still make you think. The variety is good but I feel like there were too many “rotate these things to match” puzzles. Point &amp; click aspect is great! You can move around the world quickly as the transitions from screen to screen are quick. There are lots of items for you to collect and use. There are times where you need to backtrack to find a HO puzzle that wasn’t there before. However, you have a map that will show you where an action is available and you can even fast travel there.   I would recommend playing this on “Expert” difficulty. The only thing that changes is the removal of the little sparkles showing you where things are. I initially started the game on “Normal” but found that it took away all the fun to be shown where things were at.   Art, environments and music in the game are very good. Each world is detailed, sharp and has a feeling of uniqueness. No world feels like another.    Pros  +Point and click elements are solid +Puzzles not too difficult +Hidden object scenes are fun +Story is told well +Great environments, art and music +Save and exit at anytime +60 FPS   Cons  +Voice acting is bad +Abrupt ending   Portal of Evil is an overall solid HO/Point and click game. It is relatively short with a good degree of difficulty. A great addition to the genre.    7/10  Good. Above average"
361890,Chronostorm: Siberian Border,"There were many great games released in 2009, this was not one of them. I would imagine that in 2009 it costed more than $0.99 and I am sorry to those who purchased it for that much.   It has its moments and at this price one could recommend it if the basics were intact, like snappy responses from building and unit selection or commands.   Check out some gameplay to see if this game has what you are looking for. I suggest finding an old copy of RA2.         YouTube™ Video:  Chronostorm Siberian Border | Cheap Steam Games #5&nbsp;"
361930,Farm Frenzy: Hurricane Season,"It's like some kind of clash of clans candy crush abortion nightmare given a transfusion, just barely kept alive, then crucified, and raised on a hill in the valley of Steam. It's like a bad memory, a corpse, a phone game too weird to live, but too rare to let die, so they hung it here, hoping to feed off its dying and putrid teat."
361950,MOAI 2: Path to Another World,The game doesn't even work.   http://steamcommunity.com/app/361950/discussions/0/350533172691397404/ 
361970,Weather Lord: The Successor's Path,"Weather Lord is a clicker/time management game where you send out your workers to gather resources, competing against a clock to gain a silver to bronze medal. Unfortunately this is a lazy example of the genre. The game is unstable: fullscreen caused the mouse cursor to not working, and I got two random crashes on completing levels. It is also simply not fun. The story is utterly forgettable and the gimmick of using weather comes to down to just another click mechanic where rain/sun/etc runs on a timer.  It also lacks Steam achievements even though it has an achievement system in game.  There are far better examples of this genre, even on Steam. Get '12 Labours of Hercules' instead."
361990,Lakeview Cabin Collection,"Lakeview Cabin collection is a continuation to the freeware game, Lakeview Cabin and it's just like it's predecessor. Lakeview Cabin Collection theme is set around classic cult horror movies in the sandbox genre, that asks the question: What would YOU do if you were set in one of this movies? If my memory doesn't fail, You have 3 movies to choose, Lakeview Cabin IV, V and VI. Each one of them is based on a famous horror movie, LVC IV is based on 'Friday the 13th', LVC V is based on 'The Chainsaw Texas Massacre' and LCV VI is based on 'Alien'. You will have to resolve puzzles while you escape from the horrors of each movie, while you try to keep all of your companions alive.  I just have ONE problem with this game: It's too cryptic. This game just throws you in and says: You bought the game, play. There isn't even a clue, in order to pass the game you will need to use a guide or to spend A LOT of time in trial-and-error just doing random stuff. For example: In order to get a key, you have to take a dump on top of a teddy bear, you also need to have sex with a random gal and stuff like that. In other games like, The Last Door, you solve the puzzles paying attention to the enviroment and the dialogues of the NPC. For example: You are in a hospital, you need to go to a room but it's guarded by a nun. On the hospital's hall, if you talk to another nun she will say that you should pray next to a Mary statue, the description of the statue says that it makes the place more dreppesing and gloomy. Later on, after progressing through the game, you will adquire a teardrop, use it on the Mary statue and the nun will believe it's a miracle and a premonition and will call the other nun.  All you needed to do to solve this puzzle was to pay attention to details, dialogue and use deduction skills.  Lakeview Cabin Collection doesn't tell you ANYTHING. You can't just expect that people know what to do and you can't justify it by saying: Hey dude, all you need to do is explore and have curiosity. BUT IT'S A PUZZLE GAME, HOW CAN YOU SOLVE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PUZZLE IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE PIECES ARE?   After that I have no problem with the game, the pixel aesthetics are good and aren't generic, the music is also fine. But it's gameplay is unbereable, I can't bring myself towards recommending the game. You should play the freeware game, which goes by the lines of this game"
3620,Zuma's Revenge,Worst game from Zuma series!!  2/10
362070,Metal Reaper Online,"As of yesterday, December 20th, this game is closed.  This game used to be one of the most fun and unique MMOs i've ever played. But i had to stop playing because they shut off EU server and ported everyone to USA server.  Although it may not seem so interesting from pictures and may appear as a simple TPS, this game is acctualy an RPG. Best way to describe it, is that its basically like Diablo with guns. And it did work well, game looked little too flashy and amateurish, however the skills and game overall was really fun. There were 4 classes each packed with 2 class exclusive weapons and one pistol of your choice. There is also a weapon like rocket launcher to be as ultimate weapon for classes. So thats 4 weapons in total you can switch and play with on the go.  Loot drop rate was pretty high too, just like in diablo, however there was crafting aswell which allowed you to make even better gear.  I played shotgun/smg class and my skills were pretty fun, there was one that allowed me to have x2 fire rate and unlimited ammo, which was really fun to play with shotgun and blast everyone coming your way... And yes, weapons used actual ammo, which you could run out of (though its not that expensive and there are skills which cure this issue)  There were mounts and costumes in this game as well, and also special currency which you gain by being online and which lets you purchase some of the costumes in item shop. Costumes also had interesting buffs, usualy +% of attack, and they were pretty high i've saw some go over 10%, but it wasnt that hard to earn a costume to get them.  Devs also cared about events and made special costume items for event, along with other buffs and stuff  Although it was a nice game, it had errors aswell, it kinda looked a bit clunky, there were alot of translation errors and you needed to grind alot, but i didnt mind it that much since there were alot of PvE zones for that.   Pros: - Unique diablo style mmorpg where you use guns - Skills were fun to use - Alot of PvE zones to finish - Low system requirements - Interesting gun mehanics in mmorpg, guns use actual bullets and you can run out of them - 4 different classes, with each class having 2 class exclusive weapons - There was currency for item shop, which you could collect by staying online - Devs made events for most of holidays - Mounts and Costumes - There used to be USA and NA servers at start... - Hit detection felt nice and smooth on EU server, i havent encountered many delays  Cons: - Very grindy - Looks a bit clunky, but this allows players with older computers to play - It could've used more updates - Costumes from item shop had buff stats, which kinda makes them P2W, but you could earn these costumes for free aswell, via collecting currency you get by staying online in game for hours in row (i tried to say afking in more fancier way) - It could have given a bit more care for PvP, there were some events daily but not enough of them.   Either way, i think it needed better marketing, and it could've maybe worked, or maybe a bit more of content updates. Sadly its too late now, Rest in peace Metal Reaper Online."
362090,Siralim,"Despite asking around and searching for solutions for my problems, I have to say this game does not work for me. I have tried every concievable fix and workaround but the game refuses to work, and the developers offered me less than effective advice to fix it.  Review edited to clarify that im not making up 'Blatant lies' merely stating my situtation."
362130,Ashes of Immortality,"I'm having a real hard time trying to like this game, there are multiple spelling and grammar errors, the story is almost as lame as is the 'humor' used, an dI use quotations because it can be techinically called humor, it's just not funny.  It's grindy, monotonous and just hard to enjoy, I find my self falling asleep after each hour of gameplay. Do not buy this game.  0/5"
362140,Ashes of Immortality II,"Having played the first ashes of immortality I'm pretty disappointed so far. Frankly the game runs really bad on my laptop. THe same laptop had no problem with the first one and obviously the graphics here arent pushing any boundaries. I'd also appreciate more control options. I know its rpg maker, and those games usually give you really bad options but this is pretty pitiful. Story and characters seem interesting so far. Going to play later tonight on my desktop. HOpefully that will resolve performance issues."
362160,Sydney's World,"I am soooooooooooooooo confused...   Is this supposed to be a medieval game? An Anime game?   So you got one cutesy character and then some scary looking old man with crazy powers...  IDK what the little girl is supposed to do, but all she does is whine about food...  Then we got the main character and his sister? Priest? IDK  Oh and like 3 different worlds going on with not much of a backstory on what's going on......   So how's the game? Well I played it for a little under an hour so far and all I can say is, WTF IS HAPPENING?!?   The story is jumping from one scenario to the next with little to none backstory on what's the storyline is about..."

362490,Exanima, Early Access Review
362610,High On Racing,"There are way too many bugs in this game to enjoy it. Even with those fixed I wonder if my review would be any different...  High On Racings is bad game. Not only because it's short (only 15 levels, which can be completed without any problems), but it also looks bad and doesn't have interesting gameplay. There are levels where ground plates shows incorrect turns and places where you will be trapped without any way out, forcing you to restart level. The achievements are way to easy to get (just beating levels to get them) and making some high scores aren't so hard too - 'thanks' to some levels and this one trick you can use.  I don't feel that High On Racing is even worth to get at 1/10 of price, so I suggest everyone to stay away from this game. There are plenty of better indie racing games."
362620,Software Inc.,   Early Access Review
362660,Blue Rose Reprise,"[Neutral Review]  First, I need to say that I don't know why this Visual Novel is so underrated. It has a lot of defects - and I'll talk about some below - but it's still an average Visual Novel. There's a lot of crap Visual Novels out there made only for the sake of the fanservice and they have tons of positive reviews. That seems pretty unfair to me.  The game is kind of short, so it might be a good game to get in a bundle or a good sale. I've seen it in bundles pretty cheap a lot of times. It can be classified more as an Otome Game than as Fantasy Visual Novel, because only a few after the game starts, the main plot is a bit shoved aside to focus more and more in the romantic relation between the characters. Or I should say between Lena and the one you'll pursue as her love affair in game. Also, many people related that they couldn't get attached to any of the characters even with the lots of interaction between them. And yeah... some characters are pretty standart and cliché at all, in my opinion. So it's easy to feel nothing for them.  Another boring thing is that the 'replayability' of the game sucks: most of the game parts will be pretty much the same if you decide to start a new route after completing your first one.   The art style is decent. It’s not amazing, but it has a certain charm. BG was ok, BGM was fine too. That being said, Blue Rose is a nice Visual Novel overall and you can have fun with it."

I can't get past the very beginning when you're supposed to be shooting nails at this stupid black fog that looks like the rest of the darkness beyond my flashlight. I never see the fog and I repeatedly get killed. I was excited about it and it seemed like a unique mechanic, but playing this repeatedly and receiving the same result enrages me to the point I don't want to play it. If I had a cheap controller I would have smashed it by now. This is how much this game's mechanic irritates me."

362920,Atlantis 2: Beyond Atlantis,"This is the first time playing this game, and it felt like this was a great game, but something was missing. Then I started to read the other reviews and realised that this game is a bad port from a mobile game which in turn was a port from a PC game. That is a recipe for disaster. Why couldn't they just remake it specifically then for PC users instead of cutting corners. I even did the effort of trying to find the original PC version, and can see the complaints the fans have with this. Morale of the story for the developers: DON'T CUT CORNERS!!!"
362930,Garfield Kart,  I want a refund
362960,Tyranny,Wow this game made me so mad. Its one of the best rpgs ive played in a long time since baldurs gate and witcher 3. But wtf is up with that ending. The game keeps on hyping up that final boss for 20 hours and just when the armies are at your base finally the credits roll...  This could have been a 9 out of 10 but with that ♥♥♥♥ed up abrupt ending because they probably ran out of money i honestly cant give it more than a 6.  If you're up for some oldschool rpg action like pillars or icewinddale / baldurs gate you should buy tho and support games like this.
363050,Let's Explore The Airport (Junior Field Trips),"Fun when I was little, great for nostolgia! This game is really great for kids. It was challening and complex when I was little and now it is simple. Just the way a small children's game should be! The animations are fun, lots of things to click on and interact with. Great mini games, plenty of choice. GREAT for little kids!!!"

363070,Let's Explore The Jungle (Junior Field Trips),"This game was part of my childhood. I'm pretty sure that the kiddies would love this game. Especially the Anteater Feeder minigame. It's still amusing to me as an adult. I will say this, the animation quality is great, but the lip syncing is a little off. This game will be great for kids and adults in my opinion. Kudos to Humongous Entertainment for making this game great. For Let's Explore the Farm and Let's Explore the Airport, I have the same opinion. All three Junior Field Trips games will make great fun to both kids and adults alike. That's the way I see it anyway."

When I played it, all the text file shows up as random alphabet and boxes. I would not be complaining if it was at least in Japanese."
363130,Toukiden: Kiwami,"I was on the fence about this game since so many ppl where having problems with it and high end pc's seemed to have the most. I have a I7-4790k with 16GB RAM and a GTX 980Ti with Win1064bit and have had no problems. I did not have to use the fix setting. also i got everything on and on high. the only thing that it is doing on my PC it starts minimized and i got to click it on my start bar. the controls are a bit strange as it is pretty much Xbox controller, i use a Xbox one. but ones u figure the controls out and get into playing it its fun and a big plus of this game is that it will teach you how to use the weapon, however the bow is hard at first i would assume the rifle being the same so maybe start with a melee weapon at least till u get to the training part of the game.  Online play seems to be none every time i try but so fare i had not had a problem with the quests. Over all i am enjoying this game the combat is really fun ones u know what your doing."

363200,Virus Jigglin' Fever,"The definition of a 'If you're bored, why not' game. Upon booting it up, you are struck with a charming little cutscene and are kicked into a horizontal Breakout/Doctor Mario combination. The first couple rounds are fun, and the mechanics are introduced organically. The story is placeholder, although a fun one, but not the real draw.  For the record, Virus Jigglin' Fever is a mobile game, and not the worst one at that. It was designed by only a few people, but even with the fact that this is probably their first game, there is an impressive effort here to make this game more than just a Breakout clone. The animations in particular on the sprites are eye catching, and every new enemy introduced can spice up the tedium just enough to make the tedium potentially more interesting. However, this does not take away from the poor design decisions that can ultimately bore the player to death, which if done slightly differently or a bit more polished, they could've made a solid little game.  Sadly this is not the case. One of the most infuriating aspects of design comes from the base game itself; every enemy is a specific color, and the only way to remove them from the board is to hit them with the same color ball. In the early stages this is not an issue, but when I was deep into the 8th stage, the randomized monster placement and ball color (which changes every time it makes contact with your paddle) meant there were multiple bounces where I hit a number of hard to reach monsters without effect, and the colors I would be given in succession always seemed to match the viruses surrounded by the colors I never got.   This doesn't help the fact that you can't even change your ball color, or manipulate the ball in any way. Even though there is a colored button saying 'next' to indicate what is coming next, clicking on it does nothing. This doesn't help the fact that even when you do get the color you want, getting it to where the virus you want to hit is another matter entirely. While this would'nt really be a problem in regular breakout, the fact that you have line up so many variables just to get the viruses in your way removed isn't a good time. There are power-ups, most of which if landed correctly can make a masochist round a breeze, but like the rest of the game it is purely determined by luck, and the ones that you'll see the most are worthless. Also, there isn't an actual end to the game, it just keeps going. I got to the 8th level and decided to stop and com back later. You can't go to any level past 6. That is not okay. More proof this is simply unfinished.  All of this is further damaged by the fact that some of the colors, (specifically orange, red, pink, and purple) are almost virtually indistinguishable on the ball. The viruses are fine and the art design is varied, but there were plenty of times where I genuinely thought one color was the other. Only when the ball is blown up massively by a power up I never fully understood could I make out the color, but the sprite is generally so small that I often found the ball hitting something just a shade darker and not doing a hint of damage. This combined with all lack of control makes it a truly depressing, demoralizing experience.  What could've saved this from being so frustrating would've been an implementation of a basic health system, in which certain colors cause higher or lower damage. Match the same color; instant death. Similar or almost identical? Massive damager. Opposite? Almost negligable. It would at the very least save the player from feeling like every match is futile.   This isn't helped by the fact that there is no score system. As a breakout clone, how this wasn't implemented is beyond me. It has all the components, all the power-ups, and all the clear indicators that it should have one, and yet there is not a single one to be seen. This is a breakout game without a score system. I don't even know how that was over looked. Oh, and there is a decent tune in this game, but it's the only tune. Another thing that just peeved me. No steam achievements, no trading cards, no leaderboards; nothing to motivate anyone to pick this up, even on an impulse buy for 10 cents or something.  For all its cute skipping hazmat wearing scientists and charming sprite work, is ultimately an unfinished product. It has the ground work for something fun, even the more important components to keep someone hooked, (I played this way longer than I should've) but ultimately still feels like a work in development. I really did want to give this a positive review, but all I can do is be remorsefully negative. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game."

363430,D Series OFF ROAD Driving Simulation,"I'm not a big gamer and thought I could use keyboard functions to operate, but I was wrong. Do not purchase game if you don't have a wheel. I don't recall seeing anything in the requirements that you would need a wheel. Glad I didn't pay full price, but for $8.99 graphics are decent."
363440,Mega Man Legacy Collection,"Leafy's simple review - #23  This collection is good for beginners getting into the whole mega-man series. It is, in the simplest of terms, like an alternative version of super mario brothers. Except, that all his siblings are other 'men' eg: fireman, iceman etc. all out to get him for stealing their shorts! Is it hard? Yes. Is it rewarding? It is always interesting to finally get to the boss levels but, in true japanese fashion, doesn't always make sense."
363460,Spermination,A ridiculously silly game. This game is childish but still fun. 10/10 would redcommend.
363490,Escape Machines, Early Access Review
363510,STAR-BOX: RPG Adventures in Space!,"I've seen worse, but only a few.   The controls are obnoxious and don't really make movement possible while shooting. Moving around is a challenge by itself, even on your own ship, especially if you're trying to open a console. Which is another thing, objects with which you can interact should be more obvious from the background.  Overall, the game has a lot on which it can improve, I barely played it before dying without understanding why. I believe there was a glitch and a monster killed me before it showed up on screen. Who knows.  I'll leave an updated review if I play it further. Bottom line: don't buy unless it's a dollar."
363520,Goliath,"The game is neat, and is doing somethings that I really like. However over all the game just feels like it is lacking. The mechs don't feel like big stompy death machine, and more like just a power armor exosuit. Which by all means is fine. But I felt there could have been so much more as far as customization of the robots. Granted I only played for a couple hours, and I am sure I just scratched the surface, but I wanted to dual wield melee weapons instead of being forced to have a gun on one armor and melee on the other.  Overall I can see this game will appeal to some, but it do not do enough to grab my attention. Maybe with a few more layers of polish I will give it another look."
363530,Robot Arena III,"I have played many build and battle games, as well as Robot Arena 2. I had figured this would be an improved version of RA2. After playing around with the game for a few nights and trying to give it the best chance i could, I have to say that Robot Arena 3 has worse graphics, controls, physics, and overall quality is horrible in comparision to the others in the series (which in themselves were not the greatest games but at least playable). I was excited when i saw that there was a new version of one of my old Favorites I just hope they will consider a refund.   Here are some of the problems (in my opinion):  - Incredibly unrealistic in everyway possible.  - Gives no sense of immersion into the real life Robot Battling world. - When building your robot, the builder allows for clipping of parts. - The weapons do not interact properly with other robots. - Sometimes the robots just bug out and 'fly' around the map. - The scale of the robots and arenas are WAY off giving it a cartoony feel. - The 'high speed' motors seem to be 1/3 the speed of the previous games. - Frequent game crashes (all updates done, computer is more than powerful enough to run a 'Fantanstic' lvl. - Game glitches can cause your robot to become corrupt. (things like parts disapearing, robots becoming unusable. because they are locked in a battle that is not compatible with the robot.  - Texture files are worse than N64 games.  - Points system is badly designed and seems to not reflect actual damage.  - Damage is not even close to realistic.  - Camera angles make for very difficult combat. (even with the addition of a mountable camera)  Overall one of the worse Build &amp; Battle games ever played. (Enough for me to write a review just to prevent others from making the same mistake). DO NOT BUY."
363580,PING 1.5+,Very fun retro Pong/Breakout-style game. Highly recommended :)

363610,Botology,"Bad, But still a better love story then twilight."
363620,Tea Party Simulator 2015™,"I cant believe the bad reviews for this, this game is hilarious. Makes Ampu-tea look like trash."
363650,Hacker's Beat,"  (Clarification for the above: Received as a gift from a friend.)  Hacker's Beat is fun. It's incredibly satisfying and has a really neat concept with some of the cutest presentation I've ever seen. But it's not without it's litlte let downs that could be fixed.   Fix 1: Speed up the load times and the intro to songs. Every song in the game is rather short so the load time between getting to the song list and also even starting a song is pretty long by comparison.  Fix 2: Order the songs by difficulty. The 'Levels' on each song is not only unnoticeable but seems to be a very vague scale since the one song labelled 'Lv. 0' is actually pretty difficult.   Fix 3: Fix the weird typing errors in the tutorial and also fix the Japanese titles of a couple of songs so they don't appear as mojibake for those who don't have the correct language pack installed.  Apart from these three minor problems, this game is pretty great and worth the money, imo."
363660,Island Flight Simulator,The game has the elevators inverted and i cant change it WHA HAPPENE.
363670,Seeders,"PROS + Puzzles are unique and hard, but good hard. + Tight controls, even though it's kind of contradicts the skateboard thing. + Music is cool... Not amazing, bot doesn't get tiring.  CONS - The graphics are rather lackluster. - Sometimes a puzzle takes longer than it should - I figure out the solution, but I have to retry many times to position things *just* right. However, this scenario is pretty uncommon. - The story isn't that captivating, so you should probably be into playing the puzzles themselves.  Overall rating... 7/10"
363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"I was really excited when this came out and I tried to give it a chance. However, the blantant imbalance between factions really kills where the game matters most in multiplayer. Not only are factions imbalanced, but unless you already have a top-tier fleet you will get pummeled by other players who have maxed out cheese builds.   It is a shame because I really love the core mechancics of the game. It looks beautiful and the core design really captures the tabletop game of old. However, the devs (or I suspect GW) just want to push the name and not a good product. Typical of GW-licensed video games sadly.   If you want a fleet combat game I would look elsewhere (not that there are many options out there)."
363890,RPG Maker MV,"Fairy easy to use, but lets to creat complex games."
363900,Super Goo Goo,"First review: I will be honest, this game is just like a mobile game, a clone in fact. The sound effects they have are pretty annoying, and the sound when you click the mouse sounds like some hocking a spit wad up. The map is super hard to navigate, and I got lost even though they give a map. If you like childish, boring, and repetitive mobile games, then this one is for you, I guess. No need to get this unless you want to waste 3 dollars on a game that should be FREE."
363920,SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect,"A fun old-style platformer with wonderful visuals and soundtrack that really capture the dreamlike feel the dev was going for.  Overall the difficulty hits the sweet spot of not being too easy or too hard. There's a short minecart section you're pretty much guaranteed to lose quite a few lives on, but beyond that there's nothing rage-incuding.  While the dialogue is a bit rough (at one point they spell crisis 'crysis', like the video game), the actual story being told is pretty cool and well worth not letting some grammar and sentence flow errors ruin it for you.  If you didn't see on the store page, be aware that the game has no save function. It takes just shy of two hours to beat, so make sure you set the time aside to clear it in one go."

363960,Devils & Demons,"I'm pretty positive I got this game in a bundle, lately I've been going through my 400+ Steam list of games carefuly playing all of them and rating them, that eventually lead me to stumble upon Devils and Demons.  My first impression when I played it was 'oh it's a nice little game', it isn't heavy on the computer, disk size or performance wise so pretty much everyone can run it and the mechanics are simple and entertaining, a nice little game, but that's all I have to say in it's favor to be honest.  It's clearly a pay to win microtransaction model of a cellphone game port, not the best one at it to be honest, but it's mildly entertaining, what is NOT entertaining is how terribly it was ported and the price they set it at, I was going to recommend it to a few friends of mine on Discord, thinking it was 2~3$, but after checking it's cost I found out it was priced at 10$, I was shocked, this game is nowhere near being worth the price tag it was set at, at most you want to grab it from a bundle and not just consider it a +1 trash game, it's worth giving a shot and playing it for a bit to see if it floats your boat, at least for a couple of hours, but I wouldn't recommend shopping for it unless it was on sales.  It's pretty much a turn based strategy game in which you have action points to move or perform spells in a hex grid map, but the music is average at best for this type of game and the animations are subpar, especially for it's price tag, STILL, it's a fun little game that can keep you entertaining for a couple of hours maybe, if you're lucky enough to get it from a bundle or a huge (75%+) discount."
363970,Clicker Heroes,"Don't ever play this game. Seriously i got stuck playing this trash forever. If you have already started playing and are addicted, please take a break from the game for at least 4 days,and then play it. You will realize how ♥♥♥♥ this game actualy is."
363980,Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden,Not even worth it at 60% off. Tedious low res game. Wish I hadn't wasted the 120Mb to dl it. Only game I have ever requested a refund for.

364060,Capsule Force,"Looks like a nice and fun game to play with friends.  Unless you've got no friends.  Which I don't.  ...  Would do well with online multiplayer. The single player mode isn't that compelling. But the gameplay is sweet, so if you are looking for some party game, you could do well with this."
364100,Space Robot Samurai Zombie Slayer,  Space robot samurai zombie slayer is the best game ever.
364130,Ride the Bullet,"You know those  endless ski games  [ski.ihoc.net] , where you hurl down a slope, avoiding obstacles, making jumps, and trying to hit gates? Well, mechanically, this is the first person version of it, with boxy 3D and fake blood, and a cheesy storyline.  Maybe recommended if you like twitch games - I don't."
364230,Lucius Demake, https://youtu.be/bckFkNPQoNA  the game often crush do not recommend you to buy it
364250,XIIZEAL,"I liked how you could attack in all directions. I also liked being able to turn my monitor on its side in order to play the game vertically. You'll probably have to stretch the game's screen size manually in the options for it to look good. I stretched it so that it didnt show the borders at all, keeping only the arcade screen front and center. It seemed like a very solid bullethell shooter from what I played. But my God, it was difficult even on easy with me AND a friend working together. In Ikaruga when you get stuck between enemy fire coming at you from all sides I like how you can switch colors to absorb the bullets. In this game you can block enemy fire with bombs for a short amount of time. But bomb pickups were too few and far between. There were many times that no matter what we did we felt trapped and unable to dodge incoming fire. Sometimes that happens in bullethell games, understandable, but read on. I believe we reached only the 3rd zone. It's possible if we grinded at it and practiced a lot that we could have gotten to zone 4 or maybe even 5. OR, they could have just added a mode with extra continues! lol Well, that was what we wished. I do like how hard bullethell games can be, but dang, this was just too difficult for us to enjoy. In our opinion, if there's going to be many moments where you can't escape enemy fire (thus giving you an inevitable Game Over), there should be more continues. How did anyone else beat this game??? Sadly, I had to ask for a refund."
364270,Lilly and Sasha: Curse of the Immortals,"Entertaining and funny turn based RPG definitely worth the price. Has many puzzles as well if you're in to that. If not, the game comes with a manual with all the solutions. I got about 24 hours out of it and enjoyed every hour. I paid 49¢ but would have paid full price. The ending is not that great, and I wish there were more options in battle such as different spells and things, and there can be an annoying frame rate issue, but other than that it's quite solid. I've found a way to help the frame rate issue is to change compatibility to run in windows 7 mode."
364300,Space Rogue, Early Access Review
364350,The Apotheosis Project,"I had no idea what to expect when I first got this game.  It turned out to be quite alright.  Project Apotheosis sounds puzzling. The game is a bit harder than it appears to be at first, because of how it's meant to be played.  In this game, two agents are controlled (it's up to the player to switch when desired/needed).  If one forgets about this, it's easy to get stuck (happened to me!).  It is advised to let both characters interact with the environment and examine any gathered items so as to progress.  Gathered items can also be handed over back-and-forth between the two of them when necessary.  Some objects can only be picked up by either of them, so it's important to be thorough!   According to the game logic, this is because both agents have their own speciality and personality (as in; one being more thorough in some way than the other).  Another thing I found really neat, was this 'follow' option, where one main character (automatically) follows the other, when this command is clicked (if this isn't activated, what happens is whichever character isn't controlled at that given time, stays behind).  Some elements of the game are a bit confusing (especially story-wise). It's just that I'm very keen on logic &amp; consistency, so I really had to do my best to keep an open mind while playing this game.  It did however make sense, so I found it somewhat satisfying.  The music was quite fitting. I enjoyed the minimalistic, yet atmospheric effect.   Also any sound effects in game were very basic, but good enough.   There was one puzzle involving portals and 2 control panels that I didn't have the patience to solve without the use of a walkthru due to the lack of sound in game.   This puzzle is of the trial-and-error type, where you keep trying and trying till you find the right combination to unlock several portals (without any sound to confirm whether you got any of the combinations right, and that means running back and forth...).  As for the intro music... well I guess that's always a personal thing ey? I wasn't too fond of the vocals (classical, opera-style, quite dramatic), though I did like the music. It was a bit over the top for my taste.  And this goes for the voice-acting as well. Especially the female character (i.e. agent Penelope Barker), had me wanting to scratch my face in agony at times (I unfortunately found it rather mediocre, but not the worst I've heard).  Quite an odd accent as well, and the intonation was really off at times.  Some words seemed to be mispronounced (even Apotheosis). That was quite a downer. I have to admit though, that I found the voice-acting sounding a lot more natural as I progressed further. So it might have been a matter of the actors needing time to 'adjust' to their role.  Their performance wasn't all that bad, just a bit stiff. The way it was programmed did play a part in the stiff execution as well though. Sometimes it wasn't the actors, it was just the way the dialogue was set up that seemed a bit off.  And on the brighter side; I did like the portrayal of the male character a lot more (i.e. agent Aaron Reid). I enjoyed his sense of humour. Quite dry. Just my thing :).  I guess these kind of details are a hit-or-miss. Either you like it, or you just don't. The game did seem to lack a bit of visual finesse. It seemed a bit rough. It was good enough for me, despite the fact it looked outdated for a game that was released in 2014. I was quite surprised by that.  keywords: sci-fi, government, agents, ancient mysteries, secrecy, paranormal ability  NB definitely great for conspiracy theory enthusiasts!"
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game is a lot of fun... after you've added the Radius Mod package that fixes the AI, adds a ton of units, and rebalances the economy in a way that is fun and challenging. All for free. The World Map is beautiful provided you have the hardware to run it.   The default unit balance (and thus Multiplayer balance) is obnoxiously bad.   But then you've got DLC so shamefully overpriced it's practically spitting in the customers' eyes. Not a good way to do bussiness. Two thumbs down."
364370,The Sheltered,sucks
364390,Downfall,Wonderful companion to The Cat Lady. I just loved every part of it. I look forward to Loreli.
364420,Roguelands,"1) It's released, but really it should be early access... The dev is still developing, so that's a good thing, but it should really still be in early access. There are items you pick up that are basically placeholders and do nothing. Some of this has changed with the latest patch, but you should know what you're getting into.  2) It's a grindfest. You just do the 'same' (procedurally generated, but little variety) levels over and over and over. When you're strong enough, you move the the next planet/level and repeat. You're grinding to gain experience and items for crafting. Crafting is similar, you craft the same item over and over and over until you get a rare form of it to actually use. In the end, it just got boring for me."
364450,Freshman Year,"A short story of a night out for two women, newly arrived at a college in a big city, presented interactively.  The writing is good and the art suits it well, the soundtrack is the escalator you're walking on towards the conclusion.  Worth a go, especially if you're going to be experiencing college soon, or might have just started. "
364480,Red Goblin: Cursed Forest,  Utter garbage. Another example of a terribad 2d platformer that attempts to use a physics engine entity for the player controller. Apparently the devs are obliovious to how real platformers are coded and just figured they could 'wing it'.
364510,Transcendence,"I started playing Transcendence 4-5 years ago.  Personally I like the early game the best for its abundance of gameplay such as fighting in the arena, escorting freighters, and the need to run away often. For me, the greatest part of the game is its universe with just enough details to let your mind fill in the rest.   Of course I can't make a review of Transcendence without talking about its support of mods. No third party mod installer is needed. You can just download or make the xml files you want and drop it into the 'Extensions' folder (make one if needed) in the same location as the Transcendence.exe game file. Also its modding language is extremely user friendly.  EDIT: With the new nomination, I would of course have to nominate this game for the Test of Time award since it really has stood the test of time. Like I've said in my review, I started playing it 5 years ago and playing it now still has the same enjoyment. There have been changes over the years due to updates (especially graphics), the core mechanics have stayed the same."
364640,FreeCell Quest,"A solid game, overall. It's a giant continent map full of cities, unlock each city by playing a game of freecell with powerups. Some are easier (fewer suits of cards shuffled together, across more and shallower stacks), some are harder (up to two full decks of cards shuffled together, across like 4-6 very deep stacks). The powerups let you do things like Undo, shuffle all the red or black cards, move a single card to one of the goal cells, or similar tricks.   Have encountered two rare-ish bugs, where occasionally a card gets stuck to your cursor and you have to restart the level, or a card goes missing and you have to restart the level -- they happen rarely enough, and take enough misbehavior*, that it doesn't bother me much. One slightly more unfortunate quirk -- if the stacks of cards get tall enough, the cards scrunch together tightly, and eventually start trailing off the bottom of the screen. You can't zoom out, and even if you go to windowed mode (alt+enter) and adjust the window proportions, you can't get them to display well. I guess the moral of the story is 'Don't Try That'. Generally speaking though, it plays well, runs well, and all the game mechanics are well-balanced.  * Do not target a card to be moved to a goal cell by the game, and then move it yourself before that powerup goes off. * Be careful about alt-tabbing out of the window during a level, particularly if you have a card in hand."
364660,Luminoso,Awkward interface. Not much fun. Buy Prelogate instead.
364670,Skyflower, Early Access Review
364690,SUPER DISTRO,  Gift this to someone you hate!
364710,Wonky Pigeon!,When I bought this game I had high expectations but it failed. I thought this was going to be a cool game where you could fly around the city and blow up stuff but no. The controls are broken and my game lags a lot. This is very unusual since I have a powerful PC.
364720,Reagan Gorbachev,"Reagan Gorbachev was reviewed with a code provided by the developer.  Reagan Gorbachev has a premise unlike any other. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev are kidnapped during a peace summit, and must team up to take down the terrorists that captured them and a strange AI hellbent on causing a thermonuclear war. They solve this with neurotoxin, a katana, and lots of bullets from a top down perspective. It’s a concept so simple that it’s hard to find a way to screw it up, yet Reagan Gorbachev manages to find a way.  To put it bluntly, Reagan Gorbachev is not a good game. It is a top down action/stealth shooter with obvious inspirations from the fantastic Hotline Miami, but it takes the formula and scrambles it into a mess of bad graphics, sluggish gameplay, and terrible controls. Every time I died, I found myself wanting to quit the game and just do anything else. There is nothing to keep you going, besides the fact that knowing that with every level conquered, the end draws closer. When the mid-level trivia sessions on Reagan and Gorbachev is more entertaining than the main gameplay, then you know there’s a serious problem.

364790,Voyage to Farland,"'Oh look, more RPGmaker-esque trash from a bundle. I guess that I should give it a try before giving it a bad review...'  &gt;Game is hideous, even compared to the SNES game that started the series it's based on.  &gt;Ugly transparent minimap directly on top of my ugly character.  &gt;main controls are mapped to A and B, which are  nowhere near each other  on the keyboard.  &gt;First NPC I run into demands that we play rock-paper-scissors. &gt;There are insane button combinations to throw each sign. &gt;This is because the game is a sloppy port of a  Nintendo DS homebrew  game. &gt;If you lose to the NPC, he tells you 'I always win'. &gt;This is not a clever meta joke about how this game is rigged against you - you're actually supposed to keep playing until you win an item off him.  Greenlight needs to be fixed to keep games like this on Desura where they belong."
364800,Star Trek™: Judgment Rites,aged and unplayable
364810,Star Trek™: Starfleet Academy," http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827018830  I was laughing so hard at this scene - best moment in the game. Hell, even the guy at the helm couldn't hold it anymore.  20 Years ago this game came out and it beats all those crappy games that came out 20 years later.  The gfx look like crap but it doesn't matter. It got atmosphere, immersion, amazing sound and music and story you really enjoy. The game features the original Star Trek actors and while the mission-setup is always the same (fly to a,b,c, shoot here and there) it doesn't get boring at all. At times it rather feels like watching an interactive movie where you want to complete the mission quickly just to see what happens next.  The story and the difficulty of the game will keep you entertained. This game is hard and even if you think you've done everything right Starfleet will teach you a lession or two.  Best 6$ you've spend!  "
364820,Star Trek: Starfleet Command Gold Edition,yea they are not kidding when they said that it crashes all the time. its a good game but until they fix the problem with the game crashing you are just throwing money away on a game.
364830,BLEAK: Welcome to Glimmer,"Met these guys at PAX before release and was one of the few people to actually beat the levels they had on display. Had to buy it the moment it came out, and I couldn't be more pleased. Extremely difficult platforming game that you learn piece by piece until you can blaze through it to get to the next area, but don't forget to also be patient. The music is great, the story is meh, the art is a nice style, and the actual gameplay requires precision and doesn't disappoint. It's easy to make a platforming game hard with bad controls, but dying in this never felt like it wasn't my fault."
364840,N2O,"This is quite plainly a, by definition, half-♥♥♥♥♥ PlayStation1 Emulator; so weak is the port that the on-screen indicators are PSX icons and annoying to navigate. It offers no audio or visual improvements at all, running at a painfully dated VGA resolution (320x240x256c). It doesn't even seem to run at 60-fps on a desktop gaming tower. You don't even get the benefit of a copy of 'Vegas' on CD and, for that matter, a way to play another CD in-line.  Do yourself a favor: find a copy of the PlayStation CD-ROM, get an accelerated PSX emulator (some of them are free) or even just a used PS1. Honestly! This class of shovelware is overpriced at a dollar.."
364850,StartBolita,"  Update  : so...I guess it's a little bit late since the update for StartBolita Green Box was late September, but here's an update: Think of the Green box as a new game that the developer gave to people who already owned the original Startbolita... but here's the plot twist: the new game isn't actually a normal marble game but an puzzle game where you control a marble and you need to put the cubes in the designed spots!     Pros:"
364880,Genesis of Drones,   A Side-scrolling Action Shooter
364890,The Lost Battalion: All Out Warfare,"THIS GAME IS HILARIOUSLY BAD. But like many others have mentioned, its only a dollar. therefor it is tottally worth the expirience.  I am however looking forward to further development and fixes,   THE MENUS LOOK AMAZING NOW THANKS JAKEFROMSTATEFARM WHAT ARE YOU WEARING??  still loving the continuous updates and small details that make me laugh.  keep it up guys  GG"
364900,Red Bit Ninja,"A lot of the previous reviewers' gripes have been addressed. The windowed mode thing and the tutorial thing. My xbox 360 controller works fine with the game.   Unfortunately that leaves me to gripe about the actual gameplay. Not feeling it. Sorry, but it's floaty garbage. It is what I imagine homemade soap would be like if you never made soap before. Not really enjoyable."
364910,Redemption: Saints And Sinners,"Well. It is cheap for a reason. The thought behind it is cool enough, but the game is not good at all. After 20 minutes I had enough. Those infected humans, or what they are, comes running at you naked with a club in their hands, and just look poorly executed, design-wised. Did not need to play a minute more in order to understand that this game is not for me at all. Actually not a game for anyone who has a slight bit of standards when it comes to a game."
364930,Koi-Koi Japan [Hanafuda playing cards],"One of those *facepalm* moments where I should have read the reviews first. If there had just been more explanations and translations, I might have kept it. As stated by others, there are much better games on the web for free."
364970,CopperCube 5,"Easiest 3d software out there if you're struggling learning the bigger gaming engines I recommend this software only draw back is-is that it's not well known and they are barely in youtube tutorials except for John Maksym and his tutorials (in my opinion) Are a bit too fast and I can't follow along with them half the time. The community on the official websites is very small as with other big engines like unity and unreal they're people posting questions and answers all the time. If you ask on Steam though the devloper will respond but it's nice to have a bigger community for those tech questions you have.  You can get started in a few min's, easy import you can create 3d maps from 2d, it reminds me a lot of RPG Maker MV but in 3d form, but like I said only draw back is the small community and lack of tutorials."
364980,Bunker Constructor,you would think it uses physics but it does not.. you can change nothing and get a different outcome... i found the game more frustrating then anything else... and i have played lots of these types of games... 'bridge builder ones mostly' the flaw is you need strong pieces at the top to take the hits but if you do that there is to much weight for anything to hold them up... really annoying... refund time
365020,Gynophobia,"Downloaded the game, nothing worked at the start menu, deleted the game and installed it again, nothing work again. DO NOT BUY"
365050,Escape,Beat it. It likes to mess with your head but helps you with a hint sometimes no hints and you have to figure it out 7/10 decent not the greatest but decent.

365080,Unheard Screams - King Leopold II's Rule Over The Congo,"Usually, I really like this type of game: text-based stories or adventures with some interactions (and usually a cheap and fair price).  But, I'm sorry, the final product fail to impress: the base for the story is very interesting (and I didn't know that, so I cheked it), but the game itself fails to deliver any real emotion and the more 'gaming' part of the game is too simple to amuse anyone.  On the other hand, the game is priced really good, and I think you can 'spare' 2€ for a game like this. So, this is the classic problem with Steam review: this is a 6/10 game, and I don't feel to do not recommed it, but also I have to notice how it fails to be... a game! And, at the same time, the story is to thin to 'grab' you.  So... 6/10 (also for the fair price)."
365090,Super Snow Fight,"Very fun game. Have got some achievements already - yes, the MONSTER Kill, too! But uff, 'very hard' is like snow ball machine guns against you. :D"

The oculus store is still up on my screen. I tried playing it using steam VR. The game starts on my screen and freezes, but doesn't work on my rift. Waste of money and my time for troubleshooting this crap. Also I found the developers website to contact them for help. It's in Germany..."
365150,Go Home - Rage incoming,Very nice game
365190,TASTEE: Lethal Tactics,"  This game was provided to us to host a livestream with, and I must say I did enjoy it quite a bit. Even though I've discovered I was absolute garbage at it, and probably should go back to playing something like Jagged Alliance so I can gain some confidence back.  This game will grab you, shake you, beat your head into a wall, swallow you whole, and then fart you out the other side with a smile on its face. Seriously. This game is not easy. Not easy in the slightest.   For more than 2 decades I've played games like Jagged Alliance, Commandos, XCOM, SWAT, Shadow Watch, Fallout Tactics, and more.... But I've never seen a challenge like this. This game really makes you plan out your moves carefully. The wrong soldier at the wrong time and splat your new interior decoration.  The game is fun, its got a lot going for it, and as it develops I'm sure it will get a bit easier to play and succeed. But in the mean time, it's a wonderful challenging experience.   You can see my full first time play session at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFwaDOpwQPw   But be warned. The first hour, You'll see me die more ways than if you were playing Five Nights at Frieddy's. I've always been a sucker for a good challenge and this one is going to take more than 1 play session to figure out. I look forward to streaming this one over the next few months as it comes into final form.  Or. I might just be the worst player that ever played :D.

365210,Hollywood Visionary,10/10. Would make Micheal Bay write and direct a 'comody romantic drama' that wins the Oscar for screenwriting again.
365260,Crash Dive,"It's a pretty poor port of a touchscreen game to PC. The menus look like they were crapped out of the 90's, and none of the game's tutorials or controls were revised to account for it being on a PC instead of a tablet. The game itself runs okay, I guess. But it's Unity, so that's hardly a difficult thing to achieve.  As PC games go, it just isn't fun."
365270,Shadow Hunter,"i got locked in a room, eaten by the floor and killed by a weeping angel. 8.9/10"
365280,Alexia Crow,It's written by someone who must have been a middle aged male trying to sound like a teenage girl who was trying to sound like a seven year old.
365300,Transmissions: Element 120,This game is free standalone mod for half life 2. Its really impressive what can (i think) 1 guy do. Great map and all. I hope he keeps making this kinds of stuff. It may be short but i can only imagine how much work has been put into this. Cheers ;)
365320,Quadrant,"I've really been enjoying walking simulator type games lately (Firewatch, Life is Strange, The Stanley Parable, Everbody's Gone to Rapture, etc.) so I figured this looked like a good next step. I recognize going in that its a lowish budget indie game that's also not too terribly expansive so I shouldn't expect the full Firewatch/ Life is Strange level experience. And honestly I enjoyed the story concept and general gameplay. It was a little clunkly and repetitive esp. with level design but what really killed it for me was the bugginess. I'm actually stuck at this part where the game will crash my entire PC and I have to restart my PC only to find the same in-game error.  I've had a few other bugs that have forced me to restart and for people just getting into this genre or expecting anything more that the slowest parts of the above listed titles I would not advise this game. If you know what you're getting into with these types of games than have at it, and get ready for some clunky gameplay with a fairly solid story, but anyone on the fence your $5 is better spent on an above listed game on sale."
365330,iaidoka_interlude,ITS A GOOD GAME                                                                                              JUST BUY IT      
365340,The Way of the Pixelated Fist,"I don't have comments for this game, it have some bugs."
365350,How to Take Off Your Mask,Not terrible but not that great either.
365360,Battle Brothers, Early Access Review
365400,Spoko and Poko,"The game has 3 resolutions for my screen. 1280*720, 1360*768, 1366*768. Now this would be fine if I was playing on laptop as 1366*768 is a common screen resolution. However my resolution is 1680*1050 and for what ever reason the game refuses to use this resolution. Ugh.  The music is not very good and got on my nerves fairly quick. I turned that setting to off.   The game play is that you have a ball that must fall into the cart along with picking up some diamonds and coins. You bounce the ball using the mouse. Push up for the teeter totter to rise and lower. Your supposed to collect diamonds for something I had no idea what for. There is a shopping cart icon for something I have no idea what for.   The game feels like a very lazy port of a mobile game. Unclear instructions. I still have no idea what the shopping cart icon does or what its even for. I even click on the cart and got me into another game with big boxes labeled on either side. One labeled flaps and the other with no cart. ? Not sure what that even is supposed to mean.   So no clear goals in game. Low resolution options and lack luster game play. The positives the colors are bright and the 2 insects look good. My score would be a 5/10 as the game stands now."
365420,Apollo4x,"Yet another game that I bought, played for 10 minutes and gave up on. WHEN WILL THE PUBLISHERS STOP ASSUMING PEOPEL UNDERSTAND THE GAME AND PROVIDE USEFUL TUTORIALS??? If you have not played this kind of game before do not try and start with this one."
365440,Platfinity,"As a game, it's terrible. Floaty controls making landing tricky jumps near impossible. You get a tiny handful of demo levels included to get a feel for how the game works.  As software to create your own platformer levels, it's easy to use and probably that's where 95% of the entertainment comes from for this game. However, going back to play created maps goes back to my initial point, the controls are not spectacular, and the overall experience as a game is lackluster at best, though it really depends on what you create.  The menus are also VERY ugly, which I won't penalize the software/game for since I'm judging it primarily on entertainment value and lasting appeal, but those menus look like they were built for a Web 1.0 webpage.  If you're hoping to pick this up and get some amazing platforming action, $10 is WAY too steep. If you want to let your creativity flow and see what you can create for a platformer level, well, $10 still feels a little too steep since turning around and playing your creation won't be a mindblowing affair. As a game, I'm not recommending, as software, I'm undecided. The game desperately needs Steam Workshop support to download other people's creations to justify the price in all honesty."
365450,Hacknet,"This game will make you feel like the hacking gods you see in any cheesy hacker movie. I like that, for the most part, the Linux commands there in their familiar form. It's also very cool to see the different backstories you can find when you take time to dig around every computer. Also, the  Bash.org  tidbits in there are always a laugh. Taking the time to go through every file on every server I could get my hands on gave me a final play through time between 4 and 5 hours, and I really feel like I got my money's worth out of it. You'll feel stressed like a mofo as you watch the trace counting down while you're just waiting for PortHack to free up memory so you can run TraceKill. You'll feel like a detective tracing encrypted packet headers around a network trying to find a vulnerability, and you'll feel like a total boss by the time you've won."
365460,CHARIOT WARS,"Okay, let me get a few things out of the way here, yes, this was made using the Unity Engine. No, not everything made using Unity is utter crap - there's been some really, really, really, bad things made with Unreal and Crytek, as Jim Sterling points out. Lastly, I have several games that fall into the same criticisms that I have for Chariot Wars, games that are badly designed, unbalanced, and at times glitchy, but are still fun to play such as Plane Crazy, Primal Rage, Hyper Blade, or The 7th Guest - the list goes on and on, but like I said, they're fun to play.    Gameplay: 65/100 D  Chariot Wars is simple, four directions for your acceleration, breaking, and turning, plus a speed boost that can be used after collecting 'coins' on the track. The more you collect, the longer the boost. It's simple, the bare basics of gaming and yet there feels like everything is missing. Nothing feels right for a game, instead it feels more like a school project one makes to show off your understanding of basic coding and isn't really meant to be played for entertainment.   Audio: 69/100 D+  The sound effects are nice, the horses sound like horses, but nothing blends or fades together, everything seems to be a full blast, recorded separately, then thrown together. The music is okay for what it is, but what really grinds me gears is the sound the game makes every time I press a button. They couldn't have picked a less annoying sound. And I know these things can be turned off, but that's not the point.   Visuals: 71/100 C-  Unity isn't known for it's graphics, instead it is more known for cheap, poorly made knock offs, and while there are exceptions such as with Max - The Curse of the Brotherhood, games like Chariot Wars is what fills the market. Granted, Chariot Wars isn't the worst looking game out there using this particular game engine, it does look like it's from another time, specifically 2002. The intro cinematic for example looks like something that was made for Age of Empires and goes on for several minutes longer than it should have. The game itself is bland and very static in its animation and is also a prime example of how NOT to use bloom and motion blur effects.    Content: 63/100 D-  There isn't much in terms of actual meat to the game, you race, you play through the story, you race others, you pick your chariot, your horse, and your driver.   Story: 71/100 C-  Yes, there is a story here, starting off with a double murder and a mysterious symbol on a piece of cloth, and well, yeah, it really doesn't have much to do with the actual game as far as I can tell. Presented in comic book style slides that are decently colored and drawn, it seems as though this part of the game was given the most attention and care, which is a bit sad since it also seems to be the most disconnected part of the game.   Multiplayer: 61/100 D-  It's like the single player...just with others. At least from what I was able to play.   Design: 59/100 F  As I mentioned at the beginning, I have a fair amount of games that suffer from, let's say - flaws, that ruin what could be otherwise unique and amazing games. Before doing any research and actually playing the game, I was quite intrigued by Chariots Wars on name alone, thinking 'Chariot racing? Tell me more.' The emotion instantly brought me back to when I played Plane Crazy heavily, but that was quickly dissipated the moment the game started the 'tutorial.' The basics of it boil down to the fact that Chariot wars feels like a simple track game with a Roman skin laid over it. Even the names are unimaginative and are rather what someone would think ancient Roman names would be after watching The Gladiator, and that's the unfortunate side. This could easily be a great game in the right hands, and before you blame the Unity Engine, it is just a tool. It is up to the developer to make it great.   Performance: 77/100 C+  Crashed a few times when I first installed the game, but then the first patch came and seemed to fix that along with some other things. Besides that, the game ran fine, but I didn't expect it that it wouldn't.    Verdict: 67/100 D+  Chariot Wars just feels lazy. I'm not saying the developers were lazy, not at all. The game feels more like the equivalent of an animated story board for a film. It's the basic idea, show casing the ideas that you want to have in a much bigger game, but instead becomes the thing that is released, and I feel like it's a shame that things like this is what gives people and gaming a bad name down at the indie level of things."
365480,Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion,wow i had hopes for this game but its just a pile of boring ♥♥♥♥. with no progression to speak of no unique units.. just a mish mash of ♥♥♥♥ story with boring gameplay... not worth your time at all... NO SKIRMISH MODE! NO UNITE PROGRESSION AT ALL!!!!! this is worse then dynasty warriors 8 dont give these devs a cent. they deserve nothing for the lack of content they provide. time to get a refund. gg
365500,quadrant,"A simple yet captivating game. I find myself launching this game again and again.  Ever have those moments where you just get 'in the zone' as you face a challenge? This game lets you get there with no neeedless features or set up.  Playing Quadrant can be quite meditative. Let the world slip away, and whatever you do, don't break that streak."
365510,Flip,"Great game, i would reccommend it for any fan of logic puzzles. The game length is definitely worth its price"
365560,Battle of the Bulge,"Not bad but not great as well. Buy if on sale, should be like $ 3.99"
365580,Beeswing,"I myself am a fan of art and other forms of interpretations. I was once taken to art university with my mum to check out the cool artwork that all these interesting people have made, which she tells me because all I remember is being dragged clawing the floor into a horror show to be one of the headless men coming out of the empty packet of crisps and, feeling like I'm going to be slaughtered by the nudists drenched in animal blood everyday. But she says 'that not what happened', tell that to the lady in my dreams chasing me with a Styrofoam ♥♥♥♥.   But this situation hasn't been helped by 'Beeswing' as when I took interest in the developer after playing the game, I looked up his site and checked out 'The stage'. It was like reliving my childhood nightmare only with satirical humor, like it was mocking me. I will never forget the Jesus is my boyfriend song (thanks Jack King-Spooner). But about the game, if you have been reading the other beeswing reviews, you would have noticed that they are trying to be deep and depressingly meaningful, like the freak show I went t...NO. Me, I'm just a twit who likes playing video games and have an open mind. Not surprising because I think postal 2 is one of my favorite games coming from a country that forgot they banned it. And your most likely a twit as well, dribbling onto the keyboard as you read this review. So try to keep your chin up and stop looking at the keyboard, because I'm going to tell you about my thoughts on this game.    Gameplay   The game itself is really simplistic in controls. All you do is move around the world and interact with the environment and people around it. Most of the residence have the disease of 'random sentence outburst' commonly seen in top down adventure games. The whole game is open world and lets you leave whenever you want to, but there's a checklist, so if you leave without finishing you'll miss out the activities you could do, and you might hear the developer calling you 'wankeeeeeer' at a distance. The activities mostly boil down to, go there, interact with that to finish this, etc. There is so little gameplay that it hardly counts as a game. It's more of a sightseeing tour where the only battles are fighting the text overlay with one button.    Atmosphere   The games design is literally what you would see in a scrapbook. It's one of the most crud hand drawn environments I have ever seen in a game, well a purchasable game. And the other environment that turns into clay still does not give it any justice. But I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it actually helps make the world interesting to explore. the whole world is chock full of interesting places to visit. It even helps with the random philosophy stuff the NPCs violently throw at you like a fascist teacher. It made me sad, it made me scared and not because it reminded me of the mental institution I escaped from. It also made me feel at peace. The art style fits with the tone very well and some of the music you hear is very fitting, not like the time I watched the scary footage made by the sectioned people before I had to sprint to the exit.     The negatives   You would have noticed in the description that there are no puzzles, well let me just tell you that IT'S A STINKING LIE. there's this one puzzle with a girl in a wheelchair that shows up in various places and is a task on the checklist. The puzzle is that you have to interact with her in specific places to hear her life story, but because the map is so large, it's better to look up a guide then to do it yourself. If your interested in the ost, well bad luck because you can't get it in the game files. This may sound very dry but when you want to play something in melody's escape from the game and there is no access to it except to get it emailed to you by the developer personally, you may want to think twice when putting in good music into the game. Not saying it's not a really bad thing but if your interested, wait in line with all the other Plato look a likes who made the other Beeswing reviews.    Conclusion   The gameplay is like a walk into a large botanical garden, you might be dazzled by the weird and wonderful stuff that the gardeners have pillaged from all over the world. But you might also feel at peace with mother nature and probably yourself because you've found yourself accidentally in a weed bar in Amsterdam, don't know how you got there but you still like it, and that what this game is. The price is a little steep but if it's on sale you might want to check it out. It's an experiment of a game and I applaud the developer for every life experience he put into the game and I hope he goes on with his career as a man who defies the stereotype that the Japanese are weird.   but seriously, its a damn charming game that i never want the developer to get scared to make. these games that the developer creates are really interesting, if not enjoyable.I never want it any other way."
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"i dont get why people hate on this game so much, honestly, I loved it. Great story, fun gameplay, and easy to use multiplayer/coop"

365680,BRAWL,+ Brawl is a game like bomberman but with better graphics.
365750,Rugby World Cup 2015,"♥♥♥♥ poor effort. I thought I'd buy it purely because I've been itching to play a PC rugby game.  Team sheets are poor. No rugby game should have NZ or SA incomplete. You would expect graphics to have moved on from the last world cup. Gameplay is shoddy.  Waste of money.  Do not purchase, rather wait for Rugby Challenge 3."
365760,Vektor Wars,"An excellent, fast paced shooter with beautiful Tron-like neon graphics and dynamic music. A worthy successor of the venerable Battlezone with loads of weapons, enemy types and atmospheric environments. Definitely worth buying at the low price, especially after a discount - tons of casual fun and stress relief after a busy day at work."
365770,Volume,"This game has a good idea. The controls are a bit of a problem, though (at least for me). I got about to the 10th level and I was unable to aim the bugle correctly. I tried plugging in a PS4 Controller and that didn't work. Then I tried my Xbox360 controller, and that was about the same. The main problem that I had was configuring these controllers so that they  could  work. The control configuration screen does not work at all for controllers. This game claims to have full controller support (Meaning for all controllers), but trust me, it doesn't. Thomas was Alone was a great game, but to have this game imply that it is as good as that is just untrue. For potential buyers, I would suggest waiting for a specific update for it. If a dev is reading, then I would suggest that the team fixes this. Thank you for your time."
365800,AdvertCity,"Neat concepts,   Bad game."
365810,Flying Tigers: Shadows Over China, Early Access Review
365850,Starchaser: Priestess of the Night Sky,Over all rating: 75/100 Final game status: Completed main story  Points of interest  + Fun and tight gameplay mechanics + Aesthetically interesting + Good OST  - Bad default controls (you can rebind them so it's not a big deal) - Camera can be slightly clunky at times - Combat SFX can be a little annoying  Final thoughts  I got this game on sale and it was definitely worth it. It looks and feels like a high quality N64 game. It's a great game for playing when you only have a laptop at your disposal.
365860,Spaceman Sparkles 2,Pretty good game once you get the hang of it. It might get you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from dying a lot but once you get the upgrades and new abilities it gets more intense and fun at the same time. Definitely worth checking out.
365870,Below Kryll, Early Access Review
365880,Mirrored - Chapter 1,Fun...only one puzzle I needed a hint for. The others were easy and interesting
365890,Heroes of Normandie,This is a great game. I was too lazy and waited too long to write this.It is a great table-top war game experience. The multi-player games that i had went very well but these days most of the games in the list are passworded. maybe there is a league i dont know about or something. i dont know what held this game back from being hugely popular and widely played . For me it provides a great table-top experience with fun mechanics.
365900,Pixel Dungeon,Bought this to support the developer. Love the mobile version and the many spinoffs.   Now if this only had modding support ...
365930,STOORM - Yellow Edition.,"Really priced too high for something so simple that doesn't do anything new or different with the idea. It should be a free flash game or something that comes pre-installed on your computer, not a commercial release."
365960,rFactor 2,"If you do not know how to set up a racecar I would not suggest you buy this game. It like most racing sims is not about fun and driving, it is about knowing the mechanics and engineering of a racecar. This is unfortunate as the rest of us cannot fully enjoy this game and most sim racing games. If it is a good game the average person will never know as all you will do is be frustrated by ill handling racecars, that will for the average person be a big turn off."
366000,Rogue System, Early Access Review
366010,Generic Space Shooter,"Controls are a mess. You can use 'wasd' to move while unable to fire, figures if controller is connected you must use it. But then why the hell 'wasd' is active? Ok, i've disconnected controller and 'wasd' became inactive. What? It's only possible to use mouse. The difference in controls is huge. While using a controller you can dodge and shoot while mouse doesn't allow you that freedom of control. And even when 'wasd' was active movement felt clunky and completely unusable.  As title itself suggests, avoid. Even though it has some twist with bullets, it's still not worth it."
366050,Star Balls,It´´s a kind of a real Computer game ! No Fake at all ! But just crazy &amp; funny !!
366060,Teddy Terror, Early Access Review
366100,Champions Of Chaos 2,"It's pretty fun. Feels like a game one might have dreamt up while back at your middle school cafeteria talkin nonsense with your friends. Art style also has that vibe. Nice pick up n play style combat/activities (llama fights). Some of the sound design could use a little tweaking, but the game isn't trying to be anything more than it is, and what it is, is pretty fun."
366180,Disposable Heroes, Early Access Review
366210,Sleep Attack,"A novel 'spin' (pun intended) on tower defense games. Any die-hard OCD-riddled TD aficianado should get a few solid hours of amusement out of this. Paid like 2 bucks for it, was a worthwhile buy at that price"
366220,Wurm Unlimited,this game would be gate if the server would not close.and now thay deside topermanently banner me reason cheating. i don t even know for what this is all about.pay a game and get thrown out for something that you don t now.think well before you buy this game.
366230,BASEBALL STARS 2,"I have fond memories of this game from my arcade-obsessed childhood, but it just doesn't hold up all these years later. The controls are a pain, the AI is brutal and specifically designed to screw you out of your quarters, and every match is just way too long. You can't save your progress, so it's just about impossible to complete a full campaign. I will say that the game still *looks* awesome to this day. The character sprites are big and have tons of personality. The animations are fluid and muscular; every character, every play, every movement, every little visual insert has this cartoony energy and style that the Neo Geo always showcased so well. I also love how the supposed Korean and Japanese players are just these huge white people who happen to have names like Jae Bok. But these aesthetic elements are really where the appeal of the game ends. If you want to pick this up for nostaglia reasons or just to appreciate the cool graphics, I can certainly understand that...but for everyone else, you're most likely going to find Baseball Stars 2 really outdated, hard to control, and a frustrating slog that just isn't all that fun to actually play."
366250,METAL SLUG,"The game that started it all. Based mostly on the Humble SNK Bundle (DRM-free) release of Metal Slug, so don't take my Steam stats too seriously.  To understand Metal Slug's place in gaming history, ya gotta travel back to the mid 1990s, when SNK rivaled Capcom in the arcades. In my late-teens and early twenties, I'd find myself bored at the local laundromat in St. Pete, Florida. To aleviate said boredom, it was a Neo Geo arcade machine to the rescue. Aside from Capcom's 2D fighting game offerings, there was SNK's multi-game cabinets featuring King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, Samurai Showdown, and...Metal Slug.  While consoles had the likes of Contra and Gunstar Heroes, the 2D side-scrolling shooter king of the arcades was Metal Slug. While Metal Slug's action was on par with Contra III (SNES) and Gunstar Heroes (Sega), it's artwork was iconic. At home Gunstar Heroes kept my ol' Sega Genesis arockin'. In the Neo Geo multigame arcade cabinets I grew to admire Metal Slug.  Fast forward to 2016, when Steam carries Metal Slug 1, 2, 3, and X. Most of these games have been ported to every platform from the Sony PlayStation to the PS2 to the GameBoy Advance to XBLA to Nintendo's Virtual Console to the Android App Store. With the Steam release featuring Achievements, Leaderboards, multiplayer, co-op, cloud saving and XInput gamepad support, there's no reason to not own Metal Slug."
366260,METAL SLUG 2,"Metal Slug 2 isn't awful but it's the weakest game in the series by far, and SNK later released an updated version of it called Metal Slug X. I'd say that there's really no reason to buy this old and inferior version of the game. A) Metal Slug X is on Steam, so you can just play as that, as it's the superior version of Metal Slug 2. B) The port job by DotEMU isn't great. Metal Slug 2 definitely had plenty of slowdown when it was an arcade game - it was kind of notorious for it - but this Steam port has even *more* slowdown, and the visuals just look disappointingly blurry. C) This is 7 bucks or almost 8 dollars CAD, which I think is way too much to ask for a sloppy port of an unspectacular game. If you have any other way to play video games other than Steam, you can surely find an SNK collection or Metal Slug anthology that has this game on it along with other entries in the series.  If you *do* decide to get this version, it's got the same Metal Slug gameplay that everybody loves from the original, plus you get to pilot a couple of new vehicles and there are new weapons. This game also has a bit of globe-trotting in it, as you'll go to stages all around the world. The issue of cultural diversity is, of course, handled with all of the sensitivity that you can expect of a 90s arcade action game. It's fun for what it is and it's a good multiplayer diversion for 40 minutes, but the other games in the series are way better. I think this game is less dynamic and exciting than the original Metal Slug and nowhere near as epic as Metal Slug 3. It also has the worst final mission in the series, in my opinion."
366270,SHOCK TROOPERS,"This port is ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal. The controls don't work, it lags, my character flat out won't move at times, and the menus and UI suck ( I CAN'T TELL WHAT IM SELECTING HALF THE TIME). Emulate this game. Get MAME or some ♥♥♥♥, idk."
366290,Carp Fishing Simulator, Early Access Review
366320,Seasons after Fall,"I absolutely loved this game! Waited to get it for ages then finally did over Christmas and it was well worth it!  Seasons after Fall is visually gorgeous, with nice movements and the puzzles requiring you to change the seasons are very interesting! It was a little bit short but not too much, and the achievements are all achievable! ;)  Only thing I would have liked is a little more explaination into the story, (SPOILER ALERT) what you actually are, how the guardians were put to sleep, the true ending (was it the seed in the fox or the fox reborn as a new spirit?)  Anyhow, the story is sufficiently explained for an enjoyable and memorable experience. Looked at the blog for the development of the game and it's come such a long way! Congratulations and thank you! ;)"
366350,ROGUS - Kingdom of The Lost Souls,"A decently fun game, but after 2.4 hours after have essentially done everything there is to do in the game aside from trying to get a higher score than my current best. The concept is fun and it is pretty challenging to manage all the spells, jumping over obstacles, protecting yourself, and aiming/timing your attacks constantly. But I think the dev(s) could really have added a lot more spells than the current selection. With only six spells, you will quickly find you've experienced all that this game has to offer."
366410,Ludoku,"Fun puzzle game. I'm not usually a fan of this type of puzzle game but thought I would give this one a try.  The difficulty progression in the first few worlds that I have progressed through has been very well done. New concepts are introduced at a steady pace to keep things interesting. I often find the difficulty of this time of game either stays too easy or ramps up to quickly, so far this one is just right."
366440,Savage Resurrection,first timei played it seemed fun and some people played. week later a little more people wer playeing. then i even found a full surver so i thought its playerbase is growing. boy was i wrong. i wish i hadent left it on all night or i would of got a refund. all in all the dev scum left the game and its dwendleing playerbase to rot instead of doing anything

366550,Zeuxis : procedural texture generator,It works well for the price. I used it to make all the background for Leviathan Starblade. I would definitely recommend it.
366570,CastleAbra,"It's more or less the Saturday Morning Cartoon version of Shadowgate. Unfortunately it's not quite as intuitive as those ICOM games, especially considering it's about 25 years newer than them.   However, David Bowie is great in his final supporting role as 'dude in the mirror' and that's almost enough to push it into 'buy' territory all on its own, but the representations of Agnetha and Anni-Frid are way off and that's really too ba - wait what? It's called what? Silly me, I thought it was CastleABBA.  So get it on sale I guess. Or don't, whatever."
366590,Prompt,Really Fun Game.But Too Expensive for $5. Grab a copy when it's on sale
366610,Not without my donuts,I started to hate donuts after playing this game... I am not going to Dunkin' Donuts anymore...   0/10
366620,Broken Bots,"recommend only at sale, about 80 to 90% off.  slybots is better in every way! there are also free games like this, that is also better!"
366670,The Travels of Marco Polo,Where is the vial that is part of the scene in the church!
366700,Breakout Invaders,"Lucky I got this gifted to me for free, Only played for a level or 2 but could not handle the very poor quality in this. Even when closing the game it brought up errors and it really did look like a 12year old made this.  Would not recommend this and I have uninstalled it as well.  Also, No controller supported is a big let down."
366760,Adorables,"  If you're a kid I guess you might enjoy this?   But for me I found it very boring, it has 6 mini games to play but all is just bland and nothing special to them. Most people here will agree this feels like playing a mobile game  Pro:  Steam Trading Cards Appealing character design  Con: Everything Else"
366780,Magical Eyes - Red is for Anguish,Great game. Can't wait for the next episode to come out!
366800,Mainland,You need to be a patient person for this game
366810,Dungeon Hero,"This game is best played in stereoscopic 3D. I don’t have VR but found it works well on NVIDIA 3D vision. Looking down a long corridor, Monsters and items all look fantastic in 3D."
366960,SECTOR,"'Deep in space a young pipe repair tech and his skeleton co-worker, davis, are just about to get off shift. cleaning up all hte strewberry jam from Davis' sandwiches, and rechecking the bad aumbiance lighting. The young pipe repair man starts to confidently walk back through the corridors to finally get some sleep. but what is this? davis, asleep at his post again. ahhh thats just like him. nothing more natraul than seeing a sleeping skeleton man. not that young pipe repair man is bone-ist.   He will let davis sleep it off, davis is married to three wives after all and knowing them he could use all the rest he could. the young pipe repair man walks back to the main office only to findd that the ship is under attack by pirates. shell shucks, thats simply unfortunate.   after ddistinigrating the poor maurading pirate, the young pipe repair man takes a quick jaunt to main office and talks to his old friend Taloc, the pasafist security guard. after shooting him a few times in the chest and them both having a good laugh over not being able to die, it is time to rest. young pipe repai man walk to his room where he finds davis already sleeping against the wall. and finally goes to bed.'  This is, as far as i can figure out, the exact story line from start to finish. there is nothing to suggest other wise. and i tried hard to find something."
366970,Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition,"It looks nice and plays well. The best things in this game are the presentation, good soundtrack and artstyle. The puzzles are simplistic but kind of cool on the first-go around. I went into this game, probably incorrectly, assuming that it'd have the same humour i found in the Shantae games. However the most you get are some little end level pictures and maybe the voicelines if you stretch and squint a little. Bottomline is I probably incorrectly assumed this'd be more comedic. Also the simplisity of the puzzles is supposed to be supplemented by the timer. I think design wise this is good for a speedrun or something but taunting me with meaningless stars after I know i can get them led to more time than necessary I miss a jump and instead of trying to recover just abandoning the whole run and retrying. Basically this game isn't a smart puzzle game, or a smart platformer. It exists in between being mediocre in both and trying to make up for it with the timer and star system. Buy it if that makes up for it."
366990,Puzzle Station 15th Anniversary Retro Release,"Puzzle Station's interface is cutely made to look like a handheld device, which makes sense, because this would be a fun little puzzle game if this was stil the year 2000, and you were playing it on the Game Boy Color. On a PC in 2015, it's underwhelming -- there's just not much to it.  If you actually played the original release fifteen years ago, then you might want to play it again for the nostalgia. Otherwise, don't bother; there are better falling-block puzzle games."
367000,Fine Sweeper,It's minesweeper. It makes my laptop really hot. You could find a free version that's just as good but you probably won't.
367010,Vernon's Legacy,"The story is good, it looks good and it plays good.   The overall game time is short but I enjoyed the experience, the feel of play was rewarding. The letters found during the search for keys, cogs or levers provide an interesting back story which are well written and short so reading is no chore. Graphically its stunning although a few problems with clipping through doors and unfinished textured faces, it doesnt distract from the beauty! For the price its worth a go I personally found the puzzles very simple which provided me with a fluid play through, give it a go? see what you think."
367020,No One But You,"Tbh. I like the art work I like some part of the story, I like the music choice. But It's irritating enough to be mention for many things. Overall I give it 6/10 not a bad game but the disappointment. Like... It's not feel that casually It's more like..  -Set up the scene -Camera ready -Action Trying to force player to think the same way as the main character There are not many choice that is really matter. You need to trigger the even by press the damm thing. Even if you don't like that person... THE MAIN CHARACTER IS INSTA LOVE WITH THAT GIRL!! WTF!! also There is something that really out of place and doesn't make any sense to me, Mainly Chinatsu... If you play the whole game you know what I AM TALKING ABOUT!! Don't give me wrong, I really like her story. But.. If it take place where supernatural exist I would be far much better. "
367030,Lootfest,   Early Access Review
367040,InsanZ - Retro Survival Horror,"As the game stands now, it still needs quite a bit of work. It looks really dodgy and it is on many occasions. If you can make your way past the first 20 minutes, it really picks up with a menagerie of bizarrely textured guns and a colourful cast of monsters. Monsters such as Imps, Ogres, Midget Lizard Men, charred gas mask clad soldiers that dance when you kill them, and even skeletons that throw....'rocks'.  FINAL OPINION: Not quite worth $9.99, but it's fun to play overall.  EDIT: The latest patch has broken the game. I can no longer recommend it until the problem is solved.  EDIT EDIT: It's been rolled back to a stable version. So it works again.  EDIT x3: However, no work seems to be being done to improve the game anymore. Also, some DLC has been released when the base game is rubbish with no signs of being fixed. I had high hopes for this game reaching it's $9.99 value, but it seems that's never going to happen. You have disappointed me, Dakker. Your small scale example of the AAA gaming industry disappoints me."
367050,Vindicator: Uprising,"A few annoying parts (one level in particular), but mostly a simple and fun action-platformer!"
367060,Helena The 3rd,"Very fun, would recommend. The obstacles are fun, and going beastmode. 5/5"
367110,Dustbowl,"I want to like this game. It's post apocalyptic, surface is ruined and so on. It ticks a lot of my boxes. But the combat oh god the combat. It's obtuse. The combat system is in the way of what would otherwise be an enjoyable story. If you want similar gameplay and slightly better graphics go play one of the original fallouts instead."
367120,Seduce Me the Otome,This game is a welcome relief from the endless Otome/Dating Sims that feature mysogynistic and abusive love interests where even the best choice is still pretty crappy. Not once in this story did I feel cringy or annoyed by my own character or anyone of the love interests. The female protagonist can actually end up being pretty badass in her own right and save herself without needing her love interest's help. The writing is enjoyable and the art is beautiful; there's also a lot of replay value with several achievements and endings. This is a great Visual Novel for people who want something better!
367140,Wish Project,"Wish Project is impressively creative for such a small title and dev team. Of course, the graphics aren't gorgeous and the sound design is quite bad. But the game is well priced and more importantly, obviously designed by someone with a lot of STG experience.  I found normal mode quite easy. The first 3 level are a bit boring, but the 4th level gets really interesting, after that its hype. Be sure to check the control options to set your prefered focus key.   Some of the patterns are really awesome and the bullet design is quite unique and interesting. I look forward to more shmups from this author, hopefully with a bigger production and help with the art and audio.  Buy for a fun, quick and unique bullet hell, with a little bit of a rough edge :)"
367220,Egyptian Settlement Gold,PROS: - SImple gameplay  Cons: - OKAY! (Horrible voice acting) - Too simple of gameplay - Tutorial no matter what.  Just don't.  #TrashORTreasure 
367240,Avenging Angel, Early Access Review
367260,Dwarven Brawl Bros, Early Access Review
367270,Angels Fall First,   Early Access Review
367300,Pixel Star,reminds me a failed attempt at astrouds not as addicting too slow paced if i want to play something with that retro feel id rather buy a atari at my local goodwill
367340,FleetCOMM,"  After 4 years FleetCOMM has done the impossible! Not only did it actually come out, but it managed to be a worse game than Depression Quest. Zoe might have had the help of five guys to finish her game, but at least she completed a game that manages to run. Despite having the specs to run this game, it CTDs (crashes to desktop) on launch every time it's launched. I really wanted to actually be able to play this game to review it, but that’s my fault for expecting a finished product. A journalist might be forced to abandon the review because of the ethical dilemma of reviewing a game they haven’t played; but thankfully I’m a blogger.  To continue the review I had to watch a Let’s Play that TheBaconFromHell uploaded to Twitch. The graphics are very bad and when I say it’s bad, what I mean that I’d rather look at Zoe’s Deviant Nation and Broken Dolls pictures. Gameplay revolves around spinning in a circle and using Pink Floyd Laser Light Show beams to give the enemies Grand Mal Seizures until either they die or you stroke out.  The sound is arguably the worst part. For whatever reason when you drag a cursor over a menu item it makes the MLG air horn sound. I’ll have to assume that he was trying to make MemeCOMM appeal to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥er demographic because there’s absolutely nothing professional about this game’s release or development. The soundtrack itself is mostly generic synth with a few hilarious standouts. Boreal Sun attempts Synth Hop Dubstep on Fafnir and it’s as hilarious as you’d think it sounds. Garm is a motorcycle engine revving and synth mashed together.  I received my Steam Key for free via Groupees and I would say that this game is worth no more than what I paid for it. I would say that the $0.50 Groupees “pre-order” price is going to be the most fair price point for this content. The game as it stands is an unfinished mess. What you receive is a tutorial for a game that knowing the track record will be plagued with delays. The dev team has released no word if the remaining chapters of the game will be free via updates or if they will be paid DLC. It also inexplicably refuses to run for several owners who meet the system requirements. In addition the developer seems to be going on a ban spree out of paranoia of “being ebullied.” So far ban reasons have included such horrible things as asking why the game is late, posting criticism of the game itself, posting screenshots of the game (resulting in content upload bans), banning artwork, etc. For these reasons I can’t recommend this game to anyone who doesn’t possess a masochistic streak."
367350,Demon Hearts,"Hard, quick and good harsh music. Very good gameplay if you want test your dexterity and quickness."
367430,Redshift Blueshift,this game is space pong it is beautiful
367450,Poly Bridge,Fantastic bridge building game with a lot of choice of materials and methods. Tutorial with details is given and this is great helpful to the player. Soft music is also suitable for relaxing puzzle game.
367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"This game could have been so much better. The combat is the best thing about the game, the times when you get to fight against big/huge monster and have to figure out how to deal with them are awesome. Unfortunately about half of the time you are dealing with hordes of mooks which are more annoying than anything than dangerous but you still have to deal with them. But the worst thing is that the world and the characters feel flat, so very flat. I usually like having a silent protagonist in RPGs, but this time it was too much. most of the time I was just running around doing stuff for people I didn't care about, and the out of nowhere comes a cutscene which seemed like it was significant, but again, I couldn't manage to care about 99% of the NPCs."
367550,Rugby League Team Manager 2015,I would recommend this game if you are a rugby league fan as it is arguably the best simulated rugby league game however my game regularly randomly crashes unsure if it's just my pc or the game itself
367570,oO,"I think you should consider not getting this game, because there's just a free version of it on kongregate.  http://www.kongregate.com/games/targaciej/oo  If you'd however like to get an HD version of it, or just want to support the developer of it, feel free to buy this. That's not me though. I'd rather not pay for this if there's a free version."
367580,Hook,Solid design Elegant presentation 50 levels Well worth your dollar.
367660,UfoPilot : Astro-Creeps Elite,The controls here are quite nice and it's a good followup to asteriods  So why am I not recommending it? It's too freaking frustrating. There's challenge and then there's UFOPILOT! Playing this just makes me feel bad about myself :(
367670,Controller Companion,HOW DO U CONNECT IT   
367700,SHOFER Race Driver,Just awful. Don't waste your time.
367710,Afterlife Empire,Game keeps freezing/crashing/becomes unresponsive as I'm trying to finish the totourial sequence :/
367780,Aero's Quest,"Game is unplayable. Crashed on first attempt to start a game. Second attempt had horrible slowdown about 10 minutes to the point that a fade out screen took 15 seconds. Checked the forums, others have had these problems as well.  Even if it did run smoothly, the game doesn't appear to do anything mechanicly unique or particularly interesting in the basic platforming genre. It lacks a cohesive visual design and has no polish. Nothing to recommend it above other better offerings in the genre."
367800,Diamond Deeps,"Was having fun, but there are some bugs in the game. It crashed on me but that may have been the fault of my computer. Still dont think id recommend because there it doesnt really bring anything new to the table. Was hoping for something more like Shovel knight"
368050,Almightree: The Last Dreamer,"It was a good concept but didnt live up to much, I would play it as single player for a bit but really wanted multiplayer games and it is not that, it is more a race against your friend but you never really get an any congrats you won this round or a score so just go onto next level also when one of you die you are left looking at a blankish screen only with some stick figures on a line to look at until ur friend dies, would love an over view of them in game."
368140,Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon,"Once you get used to the floaty controls you have yourself a solid platformer. World 4's boss fight was one of the most rewarding victories I've had in a while. The plot is wonderfully cheesy with many laughs to be had. Definitely recommend if you're a 2D platformer fan, I definitely got my money's worth at around $2 at the time but I don't think it's worth it at full price."
368150,Rising Angels: Hope,"I very much dislike the fact that your unable to chosse who you fall in love with. Also I rather chosse any other female character for Faye to fall in love with. No at all found of Lenna, Would rather Faye fall in love with Lotor."
368160,WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02,A nice follows up the first part. The story is as engaging as ever.
368180,Polyball,   Early Access Review
368220,Close Combat : Panthers in the Fog,"This franchise I'm playing for years (1997 Close Combat - A bridge to far) and you can say, I'm a big fan of it. This game is not drawn off course except in a some small additions. Some of them are better and some of them are worser. I do not like how (panzer or tank) can kill a platoon is such a easy way. This is a problem that keeps repeating from the 'CC 4'. In the 'CC 2' was regarding me much better solved. You could have a tank without an ammunition to run over the soldiers. These days it's not possible. The destroyed tanks simply disappear from the map. Not the everyone but it happens. You can not count on a roadblock with the destroyed tanks 100%. I love the way that every soldier is especially conducive to statistics and medals, but this medal simply disappear after the battle?! But I got a knigh cross, yeah. The backgrounds have a little elevation. They are too flat.  The everybody who are like this kind of strategy games should play this game. Because the franchise 'Close combat' it's the best war strategy game in the real time ever. The fans gonna play it anyway... I'm gonna play it agian :)"
368230,Kingdom: Classic,"The best  1D  open world RPG ever made :) Fantastic and beautiful. Fantastic is the minimal ruleset that results in a game so clever, yet simple to grasp without a word of explanation. Beauty of some shots will be given as an example of the pinneacle of 'pixel art' art in epochs to come."
368250,Valiant: Resurrection,First RPG game that allows you to fly on a dragon from the beginning... Pretty awesome!
368310,Marble Muse,"Very expensive for something that looks and plays like a mobile game. The graphics are nice, but the performance wasn't as good as I hoped for such a simple game.  It was also quite fustrating. Would rather play Super Monkey Ball on Dolphin emulator for free."
368340,CrossCode, Early Access Review
368360,60 Seconds!,"The soundtrack overstayed it's welcome about thirty minutes in. Gameplay is boring, repetive, and luck based. Animations are lazy and ugly. There are flash games that could do this better, and probably have. Do not waste money on this."
368370,Her Story,Interesting experience &amp; story!
368430,Through the Woods,"Garbage optimization, prepare to play at 1 FPS if you buy on PC."
368450,Rememoried,"This game is a stunning work of art. Everything from the surreal atmosphere to the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is just superb. The game is rather abstract and it often feels like an out-of-body experience, so, if you're into that sort of philosophical avant garde style, then you'll love it. The imagery is very surreal and dream-like, and, I found it to be very tranquil and calming. The puzzles sometimes make you think outside the box, which is also nice. As I stated before, the soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. There are a lot of soothing ambient tracks in there, but, there are also some opera arias as well as the Moonlight Sonata, for example. The music fits the environments very well. Every level is set in a new environment and the puzzles get harder the more you delve into the game. I absolutely love this because it keeps things challenging and mind bending. You may find yourself getting frustrated because you feel 'stuck' in a portion of the game, but, that didn't stop me from enjoying it one bit. So, if you are the type of person who loves surrealism, avant garde and outside of the box things, philosophy, metaphysics, and abstract art, then you will no doubt appreciate the beauty of this game."
368470,GeoVox,"It is good, but idk.. could be better."
368500,Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"[En] 'Nothing is real..., everything is permitted...' 'Attention, hunter and hunted can be!...'  [Ro] 'Nimic nu este real..., totul este permis...' 'Atentie, vinatorul poate fi si vanat...'"
368590,Albert and Otto: The Adventure Begins,"Be fair warned. This is not a causual game. It has a good atmostphere, but what killed the mood is when thy put in those 2 box ride sections.  If part 2 ever comes never put these in.  Other than that the game was okay, but I recomend waiting for a price drop first."
368600,Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri,kogtransmission 1996: 10/10 would play again  kogtransmission 2016: dank meme/10 played again
368610,The Enchanted Cave 2,"I wasted a couple dollars and 13 hours on this game.   Basic as they come. Get items, get better items, clear dungeon, yawn. Blah blah blah. It all works, but in the way you'd expect your toaster to work, and I doubt you get excited every morning to find it turning your bread slightly darker."
368640,htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diary,"I have to say; this is one of my favorite horror games yet :) It isn't really scary; it certainly has a darker atmosphere though. The main complaint I would have is that the gameplay is EXTREMELY frustratingly difficult, up to the point where the puzzles can be bullsh*t, but I will admit; it has perhaps one of my favorite protagonists from any 2D game i've ever seen! Mion is such a precious soul; and I wanted to get through the game to make sure that the precious antler child would be safe ^^ heck, I'm even making fanfics with Mion ^W^ I HIGHLY recommend this game; as the community needs to see this hidden gem of a horror game. The artstyle is fantastic, the story is mysterious yet extremely tragic and emotional, and it's an EXTREMELY challenging game. I recommend this game extremely ^W^ I give this game a 10/10, hell! I'd give it 20/10! Even though I've finished the game; I can't stop thinking about Mion, she's one of my all-time favorite characters in gaming history :)"
368650,Dark Echo,"Unique concept, foot steps, loud splashes, and frustrated screaming all in one game.    Got sad when the stranger died tho. Didn't even know him.  "
368680,Super Mutant Alien Assault,The art is gorgeous. The gameplay is exciting. The variation is stimulating.
368690,Chronoclysm,"The time mechanic is cool but I've seen it in flash games that were honestly more fun. I mostly played the single player challenge mode as I didn't have any friends to play with.   Moving slow moving characters around the screen to hit stationary targets is really not very exciting. It also takes forever to restart when you fail just adding to the frustration. This game is really punishing right from the beginning, and not in a fun way. I dont mind being thrown in the deep end but this is a bit much.  Also what's with T and Y being the default action keys?   Probably more fun in multiplayer."
368700,Mysterious Space,Enjoyable relaxing game. I have played many rogue-likes and I found this one on the easy side which is okay. This game is in the style of Defender(Atari) and Aqua Kitty. The music and atmosphere is the standout. The different planets could stand out more by having different monster sets.   For the price i recomend it.   I am looking forward to giving co-op a try.
368710,Power of Love,I can't recommend spending money for this game. There are better styles of this game. Something like Quell would be similar to this but cleaner and give you more of a pull to play. I'm not sure if it was just the way that this game was made or if it's the controlling two players that made it feel tedious and annoying.
368720,Sirius Online, Early Access Review
368730,No Time To Explain Remastered,"LISTEN I LOVE THE COMEDY,GAMEPLAY AND VOICE ACTING  BUT SOMETIMES THE BOSS BATTLES ARE SO ANNOYING AND SO UNFAIR YOU HAVE 3 LIVES: ok if you loses all 3 lives you need to restart the whole boss battle: OK  you have spikes left and right and when you shoot at the boss the beam making you move left or right and again spikes left and right: ♥♥♥♥ THIS THATS SO UNFAIR!!!!!!!!"
368740,Obliteracers,"I was making researches about a local multiplayer game. And I found it ! This is litteraly Micro Machines V4 but with less tracks/diversity, more players, more deadly weapons, and more chaos.  This is a blast to play with friends. Just go for it for playing with friends ! And of course, disable air strikes. :) Although, the solo is kinda short, the difficulty is here."
368750,Nebula Online,   Early Access Review
368760,Playing History 3 - Vikings,Storyline : 7/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Music : 6/10 Graphics : 7/10  Final note : 6.5/10  The game is funny ! I like vikings and this educational game is well done ! I buy it with one dollar so i think it worth that ... Casual game for relaxing ...nothing more ... Simple story ...I completed it in a few hours but it was fun ... It have a combat system but it's very simple ... Overall it's a relaxing experience ...
368770,President for a Day - Floodings,"A boring game which consists fully on strategising your reputation with other countries.  Some of the upgrades given can be offensive to some, like making a better reputation with China, the Americans will decrease their reputation."
368780,President for a Day - Corruption,not fun to play.
368790,OreLight, Early Access Review
368800,Apocalypse: Party's Over,"I'm not against crude language but I prefer some context. This game uses it thinking it makes it edgy or mature. It's more like it was created by fourth graders that say F%$k because it makes them look cool in front of their friends. There is literally the word animef*&amp;k written all over. What does that even mean? Besides the fact that the games tries to be crude thinking that adds to it somehow the gameplay is also very weak. All you have to do is run to one side shoot everyone until they get close then run to the other side. Out of curiosity I played with one hand using the xbox controller and the other hand eating a bowl of chili and still completed the first arena stage. (I'm not even good at games.) I gave it some time to get better but it did not so I got my cards, sold them, and deleted this game. Never to return again."
368830,Adventure in the Tower of Flight,This game is a nifty little gem for old 8-bit platformer fans. A nice way to unplug for some time.
368860,Garbage Day, Early Access Review
368880,Mystery Maze Of Balthasar Castle,"The game is awesome! Cute and friendly characters!  It´s great that every animal have different powers, you need to cooperate with all the characters for reach the exit of each level.  And I want to kick the ♥♥♥ of the evil crow (Archenemy)  FUN GAME AND RECOMMENDED!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikHmfegYNwk "
368890,AR-K: The Great Escape,"Soooo,I created some game badges and received a discount card on this game -66%.I decided to buy it and its pretty awesome.Good job developers !"
368950,Jigoku Kisetsukan: Sense of the Seasons,"This is probably to closest thing to Touhou on Steam right now..  It's a challenging bullet-hell shooter that plays extremely similar to Touhou. The character portraits are very nice-looking and the sprites gets the job done.  The music are well-made, played with chip tune instruments, and gets much better as the game progress. Bullets are as colorful as Touhou's with many references and similarity to a few games from the series (ex. UFOs and Underground rock danmaku).   Controls may feel slower compared to many bullet hell shooters, like Cave and Touhou, but it feels polished enough with a lot of practice. Hitboxes are a bit wonky in places, some bullet's hitboxes are larger than the sprites. Some of the scripts are a bit unfair, but maybe that's just the salt talking in me here.   Game is challenging even on normal and hell is, well, hell -- I would say it's almost as hard as Cave games, not for the faint of heart. Overall, really nice package especiallys for a free game!"
368970,Haywire on Fuel Station Zeta,"This is a fun little nostalgic look at the old isometric platformers, a challanging classic arcade game. The fun characters and quirky atmosphere is definately amusing and the puzzles require a bit of thought. You need to explore and learn as well as try things that are not obvious. I'd recommend it if it's on sale."
368980,Force of Elements, Early Access Review
368990,Despair,"Buys the game for 9cents, downloads the game and opens it. Sees the intro. Alt+ F4 'close program' uninstalls. "
36900,Angle of Attack,"The worst monetary decision i've ever made...    yes, worse than a selfie stick."
369000,Pongo,"Clearly, this is a game that should've won Game of the Year 2015. So bad, it's good, but so good it defies logic.   10/10 Would pogo stick platform and FPS shoot again!"
369030,Vinyl,"Pretty funny !  You slide and avoid objects on your road while listening a music. Moreover, you can add your records, that's very nice :D "
369040,Yargis - Space Melee,There's not much servers in Asia
369060,Amygdala,"The English translation is below.  当我开始的时候，我不知道这个游戏想要干什么。 我不知道如何通关。 这个游戏的操作也十分怪异。  When I start the game, I don’t know what to do and how to pass a level. The control is weird to me. "
369070,Slain: Back from Hell,"Cool game, decent metal with a great pixely aesthetic. Cool to see the devs fix the game after the horrible launch.  Dont be fooled though, this is NOT a metroidvania. Its more in the vain of the NES Castlevanias i.e. progress through levels with no going back.  Edit: Played the game a bit then my controls went crazy for no reason. Asked the devs for help in the forums and all I got was useless advice like 'make my own profile'. Me and plenty of others intially blamed the issues on Windwos 10 anniversary update but it turns out its the game. No help, no work a round means not recommended!"
369080,Age of Survival, Early Access Review
36910,All Aspect Warfare,"As it says in the manual, this is a thinking man's FPS. Yes, it can be brutal but once you take the time to read the manual and figure out how the game works its great fun."
369100,Predator Simulator,"My first thought when starting this game was that it looks like the developers are used to making games for mobile devices. The UI, the currency, the playstyle of trying to get further with each attempt and more upgrades. It's really not suited for PC. Nevertheless it seems interesting at the start eating chickens and avoiding bear (lion) traps then moving into the city to eat people with whacky physics. But that's when the screaming starts. That's going to haunt my dreams tonight.   It's just not fun. There's nothing to do after 10 minutes of running around listening to the screaming and reading the meme filled 'jokes' on the side. Also I have no idea where they got their DEFCON system from because I've never heard of one with so many levels. That's putting aside the fact that DEFCON levels are supposed to go down to 1 not up to infinity as there is more danger. So much for it being a simulator."
369110,The Swindle,"I won't be the first to say this, but the controls are the main problem in inhibiting this game from being GREAT. I don't know if I'll be the first to say this, but I'll explain a few things that specifically control poorly.  Moving while in the air is inconsistent. I've died SO many times from detatching from a wall to fall faster, then dying because I can only sometimes reattach. Double jumping, and what counts as 'landing' on an enemy isn't consistent on stairs. Stairs and diagonal surfaces will SOMETIMES count as a 'falling' state, which means if there's an enemy at the bottom of the stairs that you can walk past, but can't land on without dying, you'll sometimes just die by walking down the stairs. Also, if there's a simple spike pit (screw those spike pits btw) after a stairway, and you have the double jump maybe or maybe not required to clear it, you'll sometimes use that second jump just for jumping off the stairs.  [Quick note on those spike pits, the hit box is the exact same height as the floor, which can lead to some obvious problems. If only it was a LITTLE lower. Please.]  Jumping into a doorway that is one 'block' high (they're all that big), and one 'block' above where you jump from will sometimes auto-attach you to the block above the doorway (e.g., you'll end up here → |____  instead of here→  _When jumping from here__-------) which is really annoying, especially when trying to do quiet quick kills by jumping up to hit an enemy as they turn around, and accidentally end up ABOVE the doorway. Also: Your jump height is dependant on where you're jumping FROM. For example, if there's a sheer wall with three panes of glass in the middle, you can clear it with a single air jump (or one 'double jump', or a 'second jump', whatever is least confusing) ONLY if you jump from the wall BELOW the lowest pane, not if you're standing on the same ledge as the lowest pane. That sounds confusing, but trust me, it gets annoying because of another issue I have with the game.  The levels are all randomly generated WHICH IS GREAT. There's a lot of replayability here, especially with the 100 day limit (that you can bypass in the late game, just FYI) but this means you can end up in a situation where you CAN'T clear a three pane high window, and the interior of the level doesn't lead to the side of the level you can exit on. (Yes, you can only leave the level from one side of the map, which is always a giant building). Times you are required to execute your character because there's literally no way out are really annoying.  If you can't tell, I've played more of this game than its quality may appear to warrant, but I've ranted about it because I actually do like it. The late game is REALLY fun, using the myriad of tools to pull off heists is very satisfying. It's frustrating to GET there though, and since I don't know you, you'll have to decide for yourself if you can look past the movement and programming problems I've listed here and more, to become familiar enough with the game to...not overcome the issues, but know how to avoid them. Once you're familiar with the game, and even more at a late-game point, it gets pretty fun.  TL;DR the game is fun once you know what really sucks about it, and avoid those parts as best you can."
369120,Invisible Apartment Zero,"Some how I can not load save games,  and this story seems to have only one good path and a couple of bad endings. Spend over half my game speed reading or clicking through text I have read in the past."
369180,SoulCraft,"I picked this up from a Humble Bundle so I wasn't expecting much.  Besides from being an obvious port from tablet/mobile the game is okay. Nothing special, it just lacks depth that you would expect from a PC game. I put around an hour into it which was enough for me.  It's a pretty standard hack and slash RPG. Each level I did was completed in less than 2 minutes and during that time I was just running around with right click and spamming left click to attack. You do have some abilities but other than the E skill the others aren't really that fun or in interesting to use.  It's okay for some mindless monster killing but the £4 can be put to better use."

369370,Crossfire: Dungeons,"I have played this game for an hour, giving it its chance despite of the ugly interface which unwelcomes the player. The campaign is a succession of battles, devoid of sense. There is no story, and I didn't really get how to expand its army through the different missions. I think I simply cannot. This is all the more regrettable as this kind of bare bones game could beneficiate a lot from a good little well-told story. The other type of game is the dungeon. This one is funnier. Maps are like a maze and you explore it with your units turn by turn just like in a board game. Its is quick-paced and enjoyable. Money can be gathered to expand the size of the army (yes, it works perfectly in the dungeon mode).  But the reason I really DON'T recommand is because there is no options whatosever, and, worst of all, NO SAVEGAMES. If you die, you restart from the beginning. If you leave the game, you restart from the beginning. From the very beginning. Your progress through the dungeons? The army you expanded with gold? All gone, start again. Or not.   It could have been a fun little casual board-like game, but in this state, it can barely be called a game. It is in great need of fixing. However, it has not been updated from a year or so, do just like the devs, and forget it."

369860,Brain Guzzler,"Here's my First Play on Launch Day REVIEW video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOy1Y9Lm8YM   Great idea for a snake game!  Unfortunately, this game fails at just about everything except it's idea.  No options for graphics, controls, or sound effects. Ugh.  But worse yet, this game has some of the absolute WORST responsiveness to your keyboard presses trying to control the snake then any snake game I have every played.  I was generous in my scoring to give this game a 29% score, even with it's low $2.99 USD price tag.  As I noted to the developer in the above video, if the developer fixes the responsiveness of this game to be immediate and really responsive over what it's at now, I'll be more then happy to re-review this game. But right now, this game is lucky to get a 29% score from me. It fails at by far the most important facet of any snake game, game control! Ugh.  "
369890,Riddled Corpses,"Didn't think much of all the people saying it required a grind. It obviously does and after playing the first wave or two in survival just to get a bit more gold for pretty much the whole 40 minutes I played, I was bored.  The graphics just seem kind of ugly to me to be honest. They seem sort of uglier than what the trailer shows or maybe they just have something really off about them. Who knows. The music is annoying to. I had to mute it.  I can see some people liking this game but I think there's plenty of better twin sticks out there, for less than the $4 Autumn Sale price, and definitely the $8 regular price."
369990,"Gremlins, Inc.",The game very good and interesting.
3700,Sniper Elite,This game is the perfect introduction to one of the best sniper games I have ever played. The ability to gun and go or lie and wait for your target to appear makes this a great game for a wide range of players. My personal suggestion would be to go through the campains from the begining of the first game until the end and if you can get a friend or find someone online who wants to do it with you. A friend makes this game so much better than it already is.
37000,The Void,"Cant even start the game. Using windows 8.1. Read forums it says: replace the configs, change the path folders, change resolution, uninstall physX, uninstall AVG, reinstall drivers, and lots of other stuff. Did most of it but I dont understand why I have do all this just to play a game that I BOUGHT. Waste of time, too bad was looking forward to play this. So unless you wanna spend 5 hours reconfiguring your computer I would not buy this game."

370090,Axis Football 2015,"Haven't played much of the game yet, but fired it up and started a season with the Steelmen. Played my first game, using my Xbox 360 controller, and almost immediately fell in love with the passing controls (though my first pass awful as I tried to figure out the mechanics). Haven't explored difficulties etc, but if they scale like I would expect, the four options should give each user the chance to find a zone they're comfortable with.  Visually, the is simple. The stadium is filled with thousands of gray and black shirts, the pink endzone is a bit of an eyesore, and the players are simplistic. Not that it really matters. The playcalling interface is similar to something from Madden, and the displays are pretty straightforward.  The audio. Well, I'll give the audio a B for effort. The end result is something that sounds like you asked you neighbor to come over and do. It's okay, but a little distracting at first. However, it's not like you'd expect Grade A sports announcers on an indie title, so I applaud the effort and imagine that the 2016 version will improve greatly. I wonder if there's public domain audio that could be used for the game, like vintage stuff. That could be cool.  One other gripe with the audio is that on four successive plays I heard the announcer talking about a facemask on the play. And it happened way, way more than it would in a regular game, much less one time-condensed. I don't know if it's a scripting thing or whatever, and ultimately it didn't take away from the game, but it sounds liek something that needs to be worked on for the next version.  Haven't used but will the modding of rosters, of course. This is a small thing that adds a lot to a game like this. Hopefully the next version will allow users to mod the team names and logos as well. And basically the more opened up for modding and the Workshop, the better.  Overall, this is a very solid effort, and has the potential for some great things. If you enjoy console football, miss playing football on your PC, or just like playing sports games, you can do a lot worse than Axis Football. Grab a copy and support the effort for better things to come with PC football."
37010,Ninja Blade,"Never mind the ♥♥♥♥♥ textures, the buggy audio and the mangled collision detection. This game just isn't fun, and the port is utter trash. You regularly clip through things. The audio is buggy, when it's not just sounding like ♥♥♥♥♥. It's absolutely FULL of quick time events. It's just an all around mess.  What's really shocking is this tripe is from the same brilliant minds that brought us Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. Guess they're really not good at arcade style hack'n'slash.  Also amusingly enough, they actually removed the Japanese VO for certain segments that was in the original on 360 for no reason.  Even if you're into that kind of campy content, the bugs will kill it for you.   Stay Away!"

370150,LOOP: A Tranquil Puzzle Game,"A great puzzle game when you want to unwind for a bit. 100 set levels to work through and a random level generator with a billion or so if you need more. You're never going to run out of puzzles basically. Rules are simple, just use logic, elimination and swap the tiles around to try piece the coloured loops together correctly. Starts easy and gradually adds new elements to content with to add on difficulty. No timer, so can go at your own pace.  The only thing I'd recommend is turning off the default background music (it's generic rain sounds which kind of get old) and put on your own soundtrack to suit your mood."

370220,Animal Gods,"I have no hesitation in recommending this, as long as you don't expect an epic game with innovative systems. It's a very solid little game that perhaps makes you think a little, and has graphics and sound to die for,  The Good Stuff: - The graphic design is magical. By keeping it crisp and clean, with a unified art-deco style, it gets away with not being especially state-of-the-art.  - The music is equally magical. Normally I mute sound very quickly, but this game contains a variety of musical themes that are very evocative. (It's very reminiscent of Zelda games, which meant to be high praise.) - The game is designed to be played twice. Once with no penalties for 'dying', the second with a limited number of lives but, of course, you've learned some things from your first time through. This is very clever, and the game is, as noted, quite short, so revisiting it in this way works very well. (I know it's not a new idea, but it feels qualitatively different to the traditional 'extreme' mode that many games unlock upon completition.) As someone who isn't a twitch gamer, I felt challenged but not overly frustrated and was really happy that I could play the game to the end without artificial limitations - something that other games could learn from, perhaps. - I haven't played many games that are top-down platformers. (It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it's the best I can do.) This makes for an unusual experience There is definitely a reward in patience: learning the patterns is very possible and the game rarely bounces you into a position where split-second timing is the only way through - I think there may be a couple of cases, but I may have missed the 'safe' routes.  The Bad: - I don't really want to call the story 'bad' because it isn't. But the non-linear way they have chosen to tell it, combined with the weird approach of stamping text onto some of the levels themselves, really does not help. (And I speak as someone who loves non-linear storytelling.)  - There are some levels where the checkpoints are simply annoying. I understand why, and I don't really hold it against the design, but it's worth noting. - The zooming in and out effect is very distracting, and detracts from the appreciation of the style at times. - There is a distinct lack of clarity in explaining how the different powers work, and where they work. And there are some choices in the level design that feel as though they are there to frustrate rather than be a challenge (like the double 'jumping' sequences.)  Given that these complaints are pretty trivial, it's easy to see that I rate this game. No, it's not a masterpiece, destined to appear in GotY lists, but it's far better than average."

I'm a fast reader thus the clear time i took was rather short but I can assure you that this novel packs a lot of mind-boggling stories especially after you've unlocked the decode part.

370460,Arcana Heart 3 LOVE MAX!!!!!,"An excellent fighting game,with a system that allowsfor amazing aerial combo.  Also this game features a pretty nice story that comes in the form of visual novel segments between the fights in the story mode,of course if you don't like that the story can be skipped entirely.  There are splenty of game modes that add a lot of variety and the online is also very solid.   If you're not a fighting game expert this game has a 'stylish' option like the one found in the more recent Blazblue games."
370480,Pixel Galaxy,"This game is evil, in the nicest of ways.  You start off as a tiny little pixel, and there's dozens, hundreds of other pixels out shooting smaller pixels at you. If you ram yourself into them, they'll attach to you. This is good, because often these enemy pixels shoot things, and if you can shoot things then you can clear away pixels you cant just ram into. This is also bad, because now your ship is bigger and it becomes much harder to dodge things.  It's the simplest, rawest and most brutal shmup I've ever played. There's no memorisation of waves here, because its all random. Just pray that you get nice patterns and then feel your eye twitch when a bomb comes out of nowhere and ruins your run.  For a laugh, go look at the achievements, and look at how many people have completed each. Pretty much half the achievements have a 1% or less completion rate. That's not (just) because people buy the game and never play it. That's because this game is rock bloody hard.  and its beautiful."

I was curious what the PC version can offer. Well, it is fun. Absolutely recommended. The game pumps out some unrealisticly high FPS and I enjoy the higher resolution, many details are revealed of its nice design that are sort of hidden on the Nokia's 360p screen.  On your balls, get set, go!"

370700,Black Home,"Very asian-feeling RPG ... story, game-play and simple old-school music somehow are very well put together. I'm not an expert, but to me it has an asian / japaneese feel to it, given how well things fit together and the skills used in the fights. The only piece that doesn't fit are the monster fights -- too simple and repetative. You use same skills over and over in same combo for 10 to 20 fights in a row. Despite that I am really enjoying exploring the spooky monestary and waiting to see where the ghost-lady will lead me next or what my party-members will say. Dialogue so far has not been annoying... no repetitions or trying too hard to be funny. I did get this game on sale for couple of dollars -- i would not pay the full 9.99 for it. wait for it to be on sale, then get it if you like this sort of thing. Worth a couple dollars and your in-game hours if you want a relaxing well put together exploration game that's pixelated. Not hard to play, but not so easy it's boring."
370710,Last Heroes,"I actually really enjoyed this game. Some spots tend to become tedious, where you can recognize the patterns of the areas in the game, but overall the experience was wonderful. Grinding wasn't a struggle, buying items was relatively easy and was quick and fun, and this game rewarded strategy more so than trying to get overpowered before you moved on. I got a good 4-6 hours out of this game, and plan to play the rest of the series as soon as possible. Also very happy the second one looks like it's going to be surrounding my two preferred characters of the original four."

370920,Cosmophony,"Not a well made game. This is just basically a dodge game with some shooting as well. You just swivel side to side avoiding obstacles, then shoot other little obstacles. There's only 5 stages, and you can only progress by beating the previous level. What they purposefully did was make the game overly difficult and frustrating so inflate game length. Games take like 2-3 min, and if you get hit once at all you lose and have to restart entire level over again. No checkpoints or anything. This means you just need to constantly replay stages over and over until you finally beat it, then do the EXACT same thing but at an even faster speed at the next level, and this just gets worse and worse at the later levels. Theres music to it, but its far from a 'rhythm game', it just some generic beats that play. Game is super repetitive, boring, and frustratingly difficult in a poorly made way.  2.5/10."

370970,Unlimited Escape 3 & 4 Double Pack," https://youtu.be/-Ear7n0mqCk   The old phrase 'too much of a good thing' has the darker sibling ''too much of a bad thing'. The third and fourth entry in the 'Unlimited Escape' franchise have no distinguishing features between the two, so the following comments apply to both.  Level design by algorithm to create unlimited levels is not a simple task. Much of the random levels provided by this game can be beaten in seconds due to them being too or impossible due to necessary elements being placed off the map or blocked off locations.  The camera rotates while moving and swings wildly while using the mouse which makes it difficult to walk in a straight line, a mechanic core to a good game feel.  Visually this game is just a collection of cubes bouncing up and down which is no way to go through life."

If I would have paid for it, even if it was only one dollar, this review would have been even more negative (if that is possible).  When I started this game I already had my doubts, but I didn't expect it to be so~ horrible. Not only is the story far from interesting (it tries way too hard to be), it has pornographic content I thought would never be released on Steam. I expected the 'Nudity' tag was because it would maybe have a bit of shiny Sakura Spirit-like boob here and there, but boy was I wrong. I was traumatized by what I saw. I am not only disappointed by this game, but also because Steam allowed this terrifying experience on here in the first place.  Oh, and don't bother playing it for the cards like I did, they're barely worth anything."

371200,Halcyon 6: Starbase Commander (CLASSIC),"Excellent simple but addictive game. Only thing currently missing is the ability to mod it, and apparently that's on the way. Highly recommend this game to anyone who liked old time strategy games."
371220,VERLIES II,"As a young CHINESEMAN, I am INCREDIBLY disappointed in this game's character naming scheme. I won't even get into it, for fear of TRIGGERING fellow CHINESEMAN, BLACKMEN, NATIVEMEN, ESPANOLMEN, ITALIANOMEN, BRAZILMEN, ARTICMEN, and NORWEGIANMEN. Oh yes, they have racial slur names for ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL your countries. And to that, I have but a single thing to say:                                                                                                         FUkc you."
371280,Rolling Shapes,"This game is filled with bugs. I got a cube to glide up and down a wall standing on one corner. Also sometimes you are falling (you hear the falling sound) without actually falling. You can prevent this by pressing the arrow key for each move instead of holding it. Game menu sometimes doesn't pop up, and you'll have to die first or wait at least 5 seconds. The main menu would be much better if it was just a list with a few buttons instead of scrolling through each button with an animation.  There is so much to improve on this game! For me it was just painful to play and quit because of it, luckily I bouht it on sale."
371300,Knee Deep,I was invested until frankenstien showed up...
371310,Karos Returns,"The community is trash, all of the player base doesnt speak english; don't get me wrong i dont have a problem with other languages. I just would assume that if the server is an english one, i'd see more than myself. Hardly ever anyone online, it becomes quite boring after a while of playing solo."
371320,Samsa and the Knights of Light,"I actually really liked this game although these types of games aren't usually my thing. I got pretty hooked and had to finish it before bed haha. It was entertaining and pretty funny, and you could play the game at your pace since 'going to sleep' was how you moved forward in the game - it's up to you how long you stay awake each day and all the stuff you do! The story line had a great plot twist, and although the 'fighting' was pretty basic, (reminded me of a 'grown up' pokemon type thing) it was still good.  7.5/10: I had fun, and I'd definitly play part 2 if there was one, and I'd happily reccomend it too. It was hard to figure out exactly what to do sometimes and it got a bit boring when you were 'training' (getting xp and stuff), but overall good. :)"
371330,Two Digits,"If you can do it in a web browser, you don't need to sell it on Steam. Indeed, you probably could just play this game on pen and paper.   This is a simple arithmetic based puzzler game, somewhat more simple than Sudoku.   Kudos for supporting 4K resolution, and the visual presentation is nice, but this doesn't need to be a 'game' in the sense that it requires Steam distribution and DRM. For what it is, the game is delivered in a technically adequate sense.  If you really like number puzzles, then by all means go for it, but there's no real justification for this game being on Steam."
371360,Orc Assault,It's fun now. When I first got it I found it impossible. Now it's a very cute and fun game for the Vive. I look forward to more updates!
371370,Advent,Advent wasn't usually a sort of game I would play but it wasn't that bad if you want to you can avoid the monster battles the battles themselves aren't that bad I would compare it to more of a pokemon style battle system even though I haven't played any of the pokemon games before. It takes a little bit to get used to the controls and changing settings isn't the easiest thing to do you have to launch the game and then a configuration menu comes up (a bit like rust).  I played less then an hour and the game is a bit boring the story line doesn't seem to be very straight forward and I got lost on which was to go most of the time. The graphics look like alot of time has been put into them and the parts you walk around in make it obvious on what you can and can't walk through.
371390,Flix The Flea,  I dont like this game at all it sucks D:
371400,Downpour ,"This is most definitely not a game. It is a scene with some crappy objects flying to you and making stupid noises. The 'developer' made sure that it is not possible to progress to any other level within the game as you just die without reason after a certain amount of time passed. There is nothing to achieve within the game. There is no point to this and definitely not worth buying, even for $1."
371410,Hostile Dimension,"Avoid.   The game has almost no content, is buggy, and has no instructions or directionality. And that's all apprent after only a few minutes of playing.  Example of how glarinly unfinished this is: The wave-based combat mode? Would be nice if some enemies actually spawned for you to shoot at."
371420,Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race,"Mario Kart without the adrenaline. The races are dull and boring, and the AI isn't good either.  Stay away from this at all costs and buy  Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed  if you're looking for a Mario Kart'ish pc game."
371450,Awe,"An interesting idea. The first 10 levels left me feeling bored so that is as far as I went. In that time I unlocked half of the achievements.  I will come back to this to see if the other systems offer something different...  Overall, its not even on my top puzzler list... but it was different. For that reason, and the easy achievements... it gets my vote."
371460,Gnumz: Masters of Defense,"Very limited TD for a PC game, a straight tablet port. Too few options to place towers, little towers combos, no mazing. Lack a towers and enemies database.  If you look for a simple TD, try Kingdom Rush, or Fieldrunner 2 instead. For something more elaborate try Defensive Grid 1 (not the 2)"
371510,Gunnheim,"Great game if you like to die falling off the egde. Would buy again, Kappa"
371520,Bounty Train, Early Access Review
371550,A Bastard's Tale,"It's good, the only thing that bugs me about it is that in the controls, when you change the key for the pause menu, when you die the pause menu key goes back to space, which is annoying becuse that's my back key. Otherwise, good game."
371570,Tap Heroes,"Short, easy to play game you can leave running or on a second monitor, some of the achievements though are heavily time consuming as all out to get."
371620,SBX: Invasion,"its needs work, it could be a good game id they sort everything out"
371660,Far Cry Primal,"This should be sold as a Far Cry 4 DLC at half the price.  First time when I saw the trailer of this game I was really excited, personally I found it really unique, due the fact of made-up language and the place where it takes place.  However, going through story, it's a re-designed Far Cry 4, and I'm not referring only to the mechanics, the story is almost the same, the crazy guy with guns from Far Cry 4 is here too, literally the same character, the same attitude, the same idea of taking drugs and doing some crazy ♥♥♥♥ and getting new skills.  I liked Far Cry 4 and 3, but this one, cmon, it's boring. This should be sold as a Far Cry 4 DLC.  However, it still gets a recommendation, the idea is too good."
371670,Rolling Sun,ehhh... 3fps?
371710,Age of Castles: Warlords,"Very repetitive game, A basic tablet game but without a save. You have to get to level 101 to win. Not really worth playing."
371810,Dreaming,"LAGLAGLAGLAGLAGLAGLAGLAGLAGLAGLAGLAG!!!!!!! bad game. It isn't really what it looks like in the video. Sure, it's all orange and white, but you can't jump anywhere, and there is no exploration. I downloaded this, then undownoaded it again, but I say you shouldn't bother at all."
371850,Football Mogul 2014,This is one of the worst games I have ever played. It's like using an old outdate website with data from 2013 on football. No explanation on controls. Save your $10 and look for a better game that actually feels like it was made in the last 10 years.
371880,Collider,"  Arrows with High-Powered Pellet guns is a pretty fun game, I guess. The game modes are numerous (defend small orb using other small orbs is one my favorites), the concept is simple, and replay value high."
371890,Gunslugs,The game is good if ur just buying the game for playing then go for it if ur here for the achievemnts then thats a problem snce i know for a fact the i did most of the achiements but i only got a few of them which sucks
371900,Pillar,"  Great MiniPuzzle Game ! Different personalities to cooperate. Beautiful and immersive world , very endearing character, mysterious world. Big Work on soundrack !  Do you want to try ? Buy It."
3720,Evil Genius,This game reminds me of Julius Caesar  Julius Caesar is dead  
372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"As many have indicated, I bought the founder's pack for this game. I was quite excited and hyped to see another RO2 like game. However, after only 6 hours into this game, I decided to uninstall, why?  -tons of lag spikes and lag, almost unplayable in towns -tons of bots and hackers -boring and repetitive quests -very bad navigation -developers don't care about fixing bugs, but are more focused on emptying your wallets by adding more cash items and dlcs"
372030,Starship Rubicon,"Fun little indie game, it combines elements from Asteroids, Galaxian and FTL. The graphical style is refreshing. However, sometimes it feels like the game is incomplete, it needs more content and polish."
37210,Chocolatier: Decadence by Design,"Addictive, fun, easy to lose many days playing without getting bored.  Casual Buy, create and sell sim based on choccy. Love it"
372150,Yasai Ninja,"I definetly see potential in this game! Sadly it just feels unfinished and the menu is a pain to navigate through! I only played with a xBox One Controller and i maybe had some problems you wouldn't encounter with a different controller or mouse and keyboard!  Let's start with the Pro's: Sadly here isn't that much to tell. The only positive things to say are, that i see potential, the characters seem interesting and unique and the artstyle looks very good.  The Con's are pretty much anything you can imagine. Starting with the menu. First i looked through the settings and i had the first problem: Long animations you can't skip! Please make them shorter or skipable! Next i noticed while i have a controller connected the game thinks i am constantly pressing left in the menu. This makes changing the settings impossible, unless you want everything as low as possible. (While playing the game the controller behaves normal) After literally one hour of trying to fix this i noticed that the problem is with the game, so i just skiped the settings and started the story (without sound, because of the mentioned problem with the controller in the menu) The controls feel spongy and you have no indicator if you hit the enimie. Because of this it feels like you swing your sword or nunchanks through air and don't actually hit them. This makes the gameplay boring. Another weird thing is the camera. I can't really describe it but it just feels wrong. While the artstyle looks great if you like this kind of artstyle the animations don't. They look sloppy and lazy.  Overall this game looks fun as long as you just see screenshots and some selected videos. When you play it it just feels unfinished and far from polished. I've played Early Access titles and games in a pre alpha state that felt more finished, wich is sad, because i see potential in the characters."
372160,Soviet Monsters: Ekranoplans,"In mother russia, game title is ALL        But to clarify, the only thing that makes you buy the game is the title, the quality is poor, theres no tutorial and the gameplay is broken.  It should be an early access game, but I think we all knew it would be bad judging by the screenshots and videos :D"
372190,Astro Lords: Oort Cloud,it dosent work my hub wont show anything besides my asteroid
37220,Cooking Dash,fun to play enjoyed it very much!!!!
372210,Spooky Cats,"Spooky Cats isn't a great game in terms of content, but you get what you pay for. I had a lot of fun completing this game fully and playing it while my friends and I decided what to play together (It's that simple to start and stop). The final boss did present quite the challenge though, took me forever to figure out how to beat them. There's also a bit of lost lore that I couldn't figure out with the main character's mom but for how little it costs it was a great game."
372250,Turnover,I like how you can see where the guards are looking. I miss that in other ways. The graphics are really basic and simple. It has none of the style of hotline miami. But the worst part is how many times I failed a mission due to somethihng that wasn't my fault. Extremely frustrating.
372260,Weird Park Trilogy,"If you have coulrophobia turn back!  If you don't know what that means then continue you should be fine ;). I assure you I don't as I read the book 'IT' a few times, watched the mini series and look forward to the upcoming film so that said I will continue with my review.  I don't know what it is about these games (at the time of this review I am well into the 2nd game in the triology) but I really like them.  I enjoy this genre ( point and click, hog, adventure, casual, rpg etc) of games but some of them fall flat to me and more often then not the ones that do are newest ones on the market.   While this series really isn't that old (2011-2014), these days if a casual game is more then a couple years old it's already considered an older game (laughs, as I'm old school and I still would enjoy playing games like monkey island, sam and max as well as some others going back through the time machine).  that said this gave me the feel of some old school games and not sure I can explain why. honestly the animation in this game of the characters for me were way more fun to watch then some of the newer causal games I have in my collection and wish more games had this style of animation. I can recall some old school games looking similar. reminded me of claymation.   I also like that some items within the game don't just function the first time you click on them and use it for a puzzle or item you need to move forward.   I don't want to spoil it for others with specfics but if you play them you will see what I mean.  There may be no purpose for this other then the sheer amusement that I can use said items again to see something turn on or move.  The HOGs are pretty simple but I even like how the clicking on an item feels and the sound that it makes when I click on it. I don't always mind simple HOGs as I play these games to relax and even with this semi twisted ( in a good way) feel of over all look of the game I find myself feeling very calm and happy to play, lol.  The puzzles aren't mind blowing difficult. however you may spend a bit more time at to get the proper sequence to solve it. I think this game works best for those who aren't looking for mind splitting hogs and puzzles or super in depth storyline but can enjoy what this game has to offer because the atomsphere and finding out where you end up next is fun in itself.  As a lot of current games like this contain maps so we can travel more easily from place to place this does not but I find myself not minding that at all here.  Admittedly in some casual games I really don't like when they don't include this feature as an option but in some games it's not so bad.  If you really can't remember what to do or where to go next you can use the hint function enough to where you can find out where you want to go without giving away what you need to do so it's not so bad.  I like the atmospheric sounds in this game as well and I even keep the music on as it's not to intruding on my senses and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game where as in many causal games I usually end up playing with the music off because the music is less then desirable.   ( side note: the exception is blue tea's Dark Parables series 1-8, the music and the games themselves are really beautiful, one of my favorites - while I already have those games from purchase at a non steam place had to mention it somewhere, lol. take note that the series continued on with 4 more games however another company did 9-12 and they just can't compare with the first 8 in the series. I mention this series because while they are different from Weird Park Trilogy it has the same dark twisted but fairytale feel to it, though they really are different style of games.)  This is what you would call a Standard Edition so don't expect extras like in game achievements  ( also as far as I can tell no steam achievements for these either if that's your thing) however for an SE the first game was pretty long and I can't tell you yet how long the other two are since I haven't finished them yet but I think they all will be at least the standard amount of game time for this type of game.  Be sure to play them in order if you get the Triology, trust me they all go together.  so how many of you looked up coulrophobia? ;p Cheers~  updated: Finished all three. I think the first two were my favorite out of all three. not that I didnt' l ike the 3rd however I did run into a weird message at times, as if they hadn't completed some text in the game - if you play you will see what I mean. small thing though, doesn't interfer with game or the enjoyment to play. the 3rd game is like a CE version, it comes with achievments, map, extras. you can collect/find candy canes to buy 'upgrades'.   all three seem to be a very nice length for this kind of game. honestly everytime I thought I may be close to the end more things came up for me to do. all have really nice animation and graphics, fun puzzles and more."
37230,Diaper Dash,"This game seems simple and casual upon first inspection but underneath this colorful facade you will discover a dark and twisted world like no other. Corporations experimenting on babies fire their assistant who curiously ruins an experiment simply by picking up the baby and in his confused misery following termination he seeks advice from a local surly waitress named 'Flo.' Wilson, the assistant in question, goes on to start his own daycare in his sister's basement which develops a massive following in a matter of days. He eventually is in charge of caring for hundreds of babies a day with the help of his robots who don't perform their primary and only duties all that well. WIlson also has a strange habit of throwing away all his money and extra equipment that cost him thousands of dollars as well as downgrading all his machines the second he moves into a bigger working space. The fact that this clearly insane man who is borderline sexually obsessed with machines can have so much responsibility leads to questions regarding what kind of world these people live in. Where you pay upwards of $2000 to have a 'friendly smile' which magically encourages people to give you more money. There's also the fact that fully clothed toddlers are thrown in with the other babies that causes some bewilderment. Welcome to the dark world of Diaper Dash. I sincerely hope this wins Game of the Year because it has one of the most unique and intriguing storylines I have seen in 2010. I highly recommend this addicting game."
372350,Tumbleweed Express,Looks like it could be a fun game but I played a few levels and got some pretty bad motion sickness.
372360,Tales of Symphonia,"Fairly old game that still holds up, one of the best Tales games. The PC port runs very well now compared to launch, and the game looks fantastic. Fun as hell, and definitely worth the purchase if you're looking for a game with a good amount of content."
372380,Warriors & Castles, Early Access Review
372390,D3DGear - Game Recording and Streaming,"D3DGEAR's Desktop recording never works. Game recording is limited. Only thing useful if anything is screenshot but you can just do Ctrol + Prt Sc and paste it to paint if you really wanted to. Can't tell you how broadcast is, i don't us it, but I can assume it is just like record game but... of course... broadcasting. This product to me is only useful for two things, limited game recording and fps... yea fps is the only other useful thing, if you can say that."
37240,Diner Dash: Hometown Hero,Personally I love games like these. Sadly with this game in particular there are some graphics glitches and a crashing error but one you fix them it really is smooth sailing. I would recamend it if you are a die hard fan and love games like these.
372430,World Defense :  Fragmented Reality, Early Access Review
372480,Spaceforce Rogue Universe HD,"Short review: I got this for free... and I still want a refune.  Indepth: I got thie game for free for kickstarting another project by the devs. I'm not if it's possible but I'd like to give it back.  Graphics: The graphics are extremely dated. They would have looked stunning... late 90s, early 2000... maybe. But I remember a game called Freelancer (Chris Roberts) and it's graphics were/are far superior and that was made back in 2003. It says HD... but it's not. The screen shots provided make it look so much better than it is. Which is a real let down during the golden age of retro gaming you'd think if they were honest the players wou;d be far more forgiving esp. the older generations that played Wing Commander back in the day.  The opening cinematic was so bad(graphics/plot/audio) I can't help but think it was a test and they just went with it.  Audio: The Sound design=Horrible. The voice acting is the worst I've heard in a long time. I would have preferred none but it seems you get half and half. The brief tutorial you get are silent with your 'Cortana' telling you to press the 'Dock' key or the 'Teleport' key... you'd think since they are doing text their allow user-defined but nope. The music is barely noticable, the sound effects for collision and fire of your laser cannons (pew pew) is just bad. I would have preferred the silence in space than what was provided.  Gameplay: This is the worst part of the game. The controls are unintuitive, all over the keyboard, make no sense and the only decent thing is allowing joystick control (who has one of those there days?). The menus are annoying to navigate as they do a 5 second slow fade to black and back again. There is NO tutorial. None. just go fly... good luck. You accidently shoot friendlies so many times in the early stages of the game you may as well just be a pirate to start with.  The starting packages do include pirate as well as soldier, scientist, adventurer, hunter, spy, the third nut of the pop and don't forget your mum. They don't do much except give you a slight advantage in a few minor things otherwise there is no customising your character. You are Ace Pretty Boy with Dead Eyes in search of your sister.  Don't buy this. If you like space sims. Like really love them. As it you sneak off for quick space hyper jumps whenever you can... still do not buy this game. I really wish it was good... seems like it could have been a new Privateer style game... but it isn't.  R.I.P. Space Flight Sims (until Star Citizen finally gets released)"
372490,GROOVY,  nice game and abit too hard :)
372540,The Lost Mythologies,"This is kinda of a demo more than a game. Being a student project, i can't really say to much other than the setting and graphics look ok. The animations are eh, and the meachanics are really simple. The only main problems are that some systems will have problems running the game, me not included, that and the dodging/enemy hit reg on you is a bit broken, to the point where the final boss becomes an annoying mess to fight at times, hittting you well out of the range of his attack. For a free game not much can be said other than play if you want. Also the one achivement of the game is broken, who figure."
372560,Tanita: a plasticine dream,oldie but worth to try
372570,A Stroke of Fate: Operation Bunker,"This is the sequel to Operation Valkyrie which I played several years back. This is an older game which does show it's age. I decided to pick it up since it was on sale for 5 bucks and I thought that Valkyrie wasn't too bad. This one I did not really enjoy. Tons of dialogue to sit through which is in Russian but at least it is subtitled. Lot's of walking back and forth which basically requires you to look at every object and discuss everything with everyone in order to move forward. Sometimes objects are missed because the cursor requires pin point accuracy. The story was long and boring and I got to the point where I was saying to myself 'enough already,hurry up and get to the finish'. Movement is also like a snail pace with no ability to cut to the next scene. Each new scene has to load first. The game is not terrible it just is not good in my opinion even for $5."
372590,Grand Designer,It can be a bit overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of what everything does it's an amazing tool for planet creation.
37260,Emerald City Confidential,It is just like I remember it. Though I had some problems with my antivirus thinking it was a trojan and some mouse glitchiness on the first area in full screen after that it worked just fine. I remember playing this years ago and I still enjoy it. It's fun and interesting though simple. I do recommend it as I had a lot of fun playing it when I was younger and still enjoy it now.
372650,Envelop for Windows,"When the DK2 came out, Virtual Desktop was around for a good part of it's time in the spotlight. Physical interface limitations excluded, the resolution on my dk2 was not nearly good enough to write syntax in, which is a LARGE part of my daily job,   Just picked up a vive a couple days ago and gave this a try.   #1, the ability to place windows in free space puts this solution one step further than virtual desktop. #2 I used this for a couple of hours, I launched 3 remote desktop windows and put them in free space to keep an eye on. Now I have the power of three external machines running native window managers.  Talk about multi tasking? Yes this will definitely help those of us capable of such a thing  Usability is ahead of virtual desktop as well, despite not having all the features virtual desktop offered. So if this is a beta test, and it is not just conceptually better, but functionally better than one of it's competitors, tells me that this will be a successful product. Great work guys! You will have to let me in on some of that window binding magic!  "
372670,Realm of Perpetual Guilds,"Probably the worst RPG Maker game I've played on Steam. The writing is awful, and the combat system is so grind heavy that it's hard to play for more than two hours without giving up."
372690,Chiptune Champion,can't bhop and i can't get 100% achievment because i don't have a facebook or twitter
37270,Wandering Willows,"I found this game very addictive; farming and foraging items with the help of your charming pet for crafting items to customise your character or appease the locals requests in a bid to escape their insane dialog (though occasionally hilarious!)   I'm kind of sad that in 12 hours of gameplay I have completed the main scenario and there's not much left other than collecting the other pets and costume items... Which could get tedious as some of them are extremely rare to encounter and eggs are the rarest drop. The costume items if I collect them all I estimate would add another 2-5 hours of play.  Movement controls can be irritating when you accidentally click on something to harvest you didn't intend to, slowing down movement and depleting your pet's energy which in turn slows your progress. The characters move slowly and the graphics could use a clean-up, but it has a nice frame rate which doesn't trigger my motion sickness."
372720,The Language Game,"I think this game is great way to start learning a new language. You can also use the Duolingo or Memrise, which is free and has more content than 'The Language Game'. You can also try to use the game 'Influent', which is also available on steam store."
372740,Second Warfare, Early Access Review
372750,Girl Amazon Survival, Early Access Review
372770,Floors of Discomfort,"The keys do not correlate with the control instructions. Particularly 'F' which is supposed to open shop. Never does. The game itself is mediocre, but it could still be a little entertaining if you could actually play, as its ment to be played. Which you can't, because the keys to fit the commands. Oh yeah, and niether does any other key on the keyboard... or even numbers."
372780,Pulse,"Pulse is an interesting experience. You play as Eva, a blind girl that has the power to see through sound. It plays more like a first person adventure with some slight puzzle mechanics. The art style is beautiful!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfYNRRnSeuE "

372820,Shot In The Dark, Early Access Review
372830,Fitz the Fox,"When I bought Fitz The Fox for a dollar, I was...not exactly clamoring to play it first. Fitz is awesome. The music is phenomenal and ( I think ) unique to a lot of platform games. The gameplay is challenging yet never unfair. And I loved how towards the end of the level, you included the match 3 blocks! Great job."
372890,Red Crow Mysteries: Legion,waste of money
37290,Zenerchi,"It's a time waster that I didn't really enjoy. It lacks charm but it does have a neat enough concept of gameplay. I can't recommend it. Only buy it if it is worth under $1 or bundled with other games, other than that, avoid as there are better puzzle games to immerse yourself with."
372930,New York Mysteries: Secrets of the Mafia,"I liked the game, because it held my interest until the end and it was long enough. The story makes sense for the most part and it isn't repetitive (for the genre). It took me about an evening to finish the game, and I only skipped a few of the puzzles (I don't like the rotate-and-place puzzles, I always skip them in all games). It isn't too have on the HOS, and it requires enoughinteractivity and thinking.   I like the fact that the female lead IS the lead, and there isn't a strong man to hold her hand in moments of danger.  The bonus chapter wasn't as good, but it had a separate story which is a plus. I hate it when developers hide the end of the original game in the bonus chapter."
372940,Lost Lands: The Four Horsemen,"puzzles are not too chalenging, but good story!"
372950,Professor Why™: Chemistry 1,"Great game, I highly recommend to everyone"
372960,Robbery Bob: Man of Steal,Just Buy the mobile version. It's way cheaper. Yes it's nice on PC and using a controller is welcoming but it's just not enough to justify spending THAT much on.

3730,Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000,"All time classic, still an absolute blast to this day"
37300,DinerTown Tycoon,"Pain... I kept wondering why the F$#¨% i bought this thing....  the Tycoon addition to the name definetly tricked me... but it was the first and only time.. Thx to this game i will always triple check a game if it has Tycoon added to the name....  Its stupid, plain silly. No challenge, yet no chill. Its just sad... seriously dont buy this think 'oh manage a restaurant type o ♥♥♥♥' nope nope, its more like a celphone game, clicky clicky type of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crap.  If i got this game for free i would seriously sue the mofuc&amp;*&amp;"
37310,DinerTown Detective Agency,"This hidden object game looks like clipart literally threw up, different styles of drawings mixed in as if thrown together in a mix mash. Some items are photos for example and others are like drawn cartoons with no rhyme or reason. Worst part of the game is the game itself. Often items will be stuck behind items maybe showing like one pixel of the actual hidden object.   Playfirst makes alot of great puzzle games from NIghtshift to Valerie Porter which would be better suggestions to get your puzzle finding fix.  Rating: 0/10 Value: $0.00"

373180,Kung Fury: Street Rage,STRUCK BY LIGHTNING AND BITTEN BY A COBRA
373240,Black Sails,pretty horrible mechanics in this game
373290,Stones of Sorrow,Do not play this game unless you use an xbox controller. Completely ♥♥♥♥ ui for changing your controls if you use anything else. Can't even play the game because of this issue.
37330,NightShift Legacy,"This is an excellent game; I had many entertaining, sometimes frustrating, hours playing this game. Ultimately I completed the levels and embraced the challange I faced. It was well worth the cost for the hours of enjoyment I received."
373330,All Is Dust,I'm sad to know this made it onto Steam.
373360,Cast of the Seven Godsends - Redux,"A rough around the edges game in the style of Super Ghouls N Ghosts. Not terrible, but not amazing either. The level design and platforming mechanics need work. 6/10"
373390,Contradiction - the all-video murder mystery adventure,"How did literally the most BASIC of game design bugs make it past QA for this game.   There's a bug which once you press a button on your controller, breaks the keybindings and you cannot control the game again correctly without reinstalling. Why would you not program the ability to click on the menu options.  Note: 'Case Background Info' and 'Current Tip' are not a game options. Game options are things like, resolution, controls/bindings, a/v, subtitles, etc.  No full screen or resolution settings.. Come on, these are 10 Dollar features I would hope.  And I really am excited about this game. It looks like the video portion was very well thought out. I don't get why the game UI and controls wern't.   My review may change if I can get the bloody thing working."
37340,Fitness Dash,"Don't let the cutesy cover fool you, fitness dash is game with unparalleled depth in the RPG / Sim / fitness genre. The bulk of the challenge comes from watching your fat American customers shed pounds on the treadmill, while cleaning up their dirty towels and getting them more water. This takes a lot of skill and is no easy feat, believe me.   I cannot praise this game enough, it will forever be a classic in gaming history.  Also please, give me your password."
373420,Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition,- Played the whole game with my BFF in coop - Met cute bunny - Bunny told us that he show us the secret way to the castle - Frend teleported me by mistake on top of the bunny - My chracter appeared above bunny and bunny had no clue whats happening - Fat butt of my warriror character landed on bunny that just wanted to help us - Ground got splashed by blood from cute bunny around ♥♥♥ of my character - RIP cute bunny that shown us the way into the castle  10/10 Best RPG game ever
373440,Stargazer,"I forgot what I was supposed to do, on a mission, had to reset the game to get info. 10/10 would forget what i was supposed to do again"
373460,Fury Of The Gods,Fun and hectic clicker/tower defence combo
373480,1993 Space Machine,TBH im kind of mixed when it comes to this game.  IT seems like the enemys just randomly shoot there is no AI function rather then they walk the same path and spray bullets randomly. I was able to enjoy the game for a few minutes at 1st but once i got a bit further into the game i didnt feel much enjoyment.
37360,Mahjong Roadshow,Too simple and completely uninspiring. Free games online are loads better.
373600,Weapon of Choice,Quirky with 16-bit like gameplay. I really like the graphic style and recommend to anyone wanting to play a action platform game that is very similar to many of the old classics.
373610,Shoot 1UP,"A Nostalgic nod to the classic arcade vertical/horizontal scrolling of the 80's crossed with the more modern bullet hell shooters.  Watch out for Mecha Lilith and her metal hooters of doom! I just about managed to defeat her and mammary missiles only to get destroyed on the start of the following level. If you want something new to play but don't want to fork out a small fortune,check this out. Well worth payin near 3 quid for and you won't regret it."
373620,Explosionade,"I rather enjoyed this game. It basically comes down to balancing shield usage along with shots and auto-refilling grenades. The bosses were pretty cool and overall this was a fun little quick game. Well worth the small amount paid for it. Now I'm looking to rock their other games. Good stuff!  Update, I've not played their other games yet because, well, I bought too many games all at once over the past many months. But this one is just awesome. I can actually chill out and feel in some kind of zone with it. I usually bum rush the exit in some of the levels but others I spend time hunting down and killing all the enemies before proceeding. Great game, lots of fun (for me), and with their bundle you won't go wrong."
373630,Game Type,"'Kids, drugs are bad.... mmmkay? See this is why you should not smoke the marryjuwanna and program at the same time, mmmkay? Stuff like this game results from sinful wacky tobacky, the gonja, the sticky icky... Fact is we need to be more careful in the future when making games. Think of the adults who might play this game and suffer brain damage!'  Honestly, this game is crazy-uniquely-fun. I do recommend you see past the initial strangness of the game. This is like Adult Swim took acid and then a stab at making an anime shooter that wasn't anime. It's got a unique spin on a game and after just a couple tries it's kind of addicting.   Plus after beating Explosionade a few weeks ago I kind of enjoy this studio's wacky games. Get in the bundle too. Keep up the strangeness. :) Mentally insufficient review over."
373650,The Assembly,"Well, this is an interesting one. It's one of the better narrative experiences I've had in VR, with excellent voice work and a story that raises some interesting ethical questions without descending into ham fisted moralising.   It's a shame that the controls are flat out awful, with a point and click style interface that desn't feel designed for VR, and the worst teleportation system I have ever experienced. It's not enough to render the game unplayable, but it does make the better aspects of the game something of a chore to get through.  It's also pretty short. I finished it in around three hours, although it does have some alternate endings and I'm sure I missed a few little ancilliary stories and easter eggs along the way. I bought it on sale and I'm happy with it for what I paid, but I think the full price is a little on the steep side.   But if you finished A Chair in a Room and The Gallery and are looking for something more at the narrative adventure end of the scale than horror, You could certainly do far worse than this. I'm hoping for a sequel that sorts those horrible controls, but for now, this is pretty good if you're willing to overlook the flaws."
373670,Arkhelom 3D,It depends on how old you are and if you appreciate old school games likes this but I thought it was great! Inexpensive and great gameplay. It might feel like playing a win98 game but addicting like the rest in this genre. My only complaint is it is not OBS compatible so streaming it is kinda complicated. Need more video options!   www.twitch.tv/r1sh   www.youtube.com/rishtattoo 
37370,TriJinx,Too pricey for a simple match game. There's just not enough to keep my attention. It just makes me want to play Bejeweled some more.
373720,Ryzom,This game is one of those good examples that graphics are critically important. You load into the game and the character screen is so generic and just plan bad looking. Characters are a copy and paste type with very few changes. Everyone will look somewhat the same and only the hairstyles will allow you to tell each one apart. If this game had the unreal 4 engine and great graphics it would be a great game to play but as it is now it's embarrassing to look at and just ugly beyond anything. I could not get myself to play this game due to the cheapness feel and horrible graphics. Yes Graphics do mean everything like %95 everything. Do not waste your time unless you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer and can't play anything else
373730,Way of Gold and Steel,"First review on Steam. Like the game enough so far to write a review.  It's simple. The UI is a bit unforgiving at first (it took me a bit to realize that buildings spawn workers which also spawn resources; many games make you work for each of those things individually, so I was slow to catch on). But once it 'clicks' for you, which doesn't take too long, you'll be hard at work. And the 'violently running headlong into crocodiles' to kill them before they eat your workers' thing doesn't get old. Especially when you can sell their skins for iron ore. Which you need for weapons because CRAP HERE COME THE ANGRY NATIVES. Like I said, it's simple, but it doesn't feel totally banal either. Losing a logger to a crocodile's maw hurts, especially when you need them to chop enough wood to build a way off the island.  The whole 'pour a cup of coffee and watch your minions carry out your orders' shtick makes for a great angle. It's the perfect game to play in the morning as you wake up: just mentally taxing enough. The pastel color scheme is easy on the eyes too (though, on the flip side, I've heard some say they're not crazy about the graphics - to each his own, I guess).  Honestly, I paid a dollar for this thing. If it hadn't been so cheap, I might not have tried it. But now I have, I would definitely pay more. So long as it stays under $10, and updates come regularly, this can grow into a fun little hobby. It's no Dwarf Fortress, Gnormoria, etc etc etc. But as a relaxing management sim, it scratches just enough of the right itch."
373750,DinoSystem, Early Access Review
373770,LiEat,"LiEat is one of those games that you check and don't really know what to expect at first, The Game release on Steam is divided into 3 parts (or 3 games as others users have told before).  Each chapter features the iconic duo of a young humanoid dragon-like child called Efina and her 'Papa'.  The sprite-like art is gorgeous, the short cutscenes and art leaves the player wanting for more, it also features JRPG like elements as combat and items but falls short in a sense that it very simple and too easy with almost no depth in the combat system, nonetheless it still a game in which fans of JRPG will enjoy for it's stories and lore relations between the games.  It also has achievements and steam cards, which is always nice."
37380,Valerie Porter,"Damn, check out that fine woman. Valerie Porter has truely captured the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ disproportional and airbrushed look of the 1920s. This is truely a game that defines a time period where women went around barging into people's horrifically messy rooms and offices with a shopping list of things to steal and/or clean up.  This game takes the tension of a scandalous secretary that went above and beyond the call of duty to become a vigilante maid. It is only up to the hardiness of the player to ensure she avoids the police enough to do god's work.  8/10."
373800,Fantastic Pinball Thrills,"Yea this isn't the best Pinball game, but it's far from the worst. If you like Pinball I'd recommend giving it a shot."
373810,Hot Pinball Thrills,"This is an OK pinball game. I recommend it only for those who are not pinball snobs though and only on sale. This Pinball Thrills pack also has some .. entertaining voice effects, as in 'You are sexy'. Well thankyouverymuch. :$  Non-proportional stretching of the item models on my widescreen appear to make things look slightly squished vertically, ball physics are definitely off, the music is very repetitive after a bit, and the ball is fairly dark in this one for some reason. The 3 tables included seem to include minimal modes and mini-games so, no, it's not comparable to Real Arcade or Pinball FX 2, so just be aware of that up front.   That said, the controls work well for keyboard and 360 gamepad, and it even has one feature that the big boys don't: you can enter your highscore name with the keyboard. Maybe they could learn something from this after all. :)"

373860,Apothecarium: The Renaissance of Evil - Premium Edition,Game flickers with on screen display from the start of launching the game (It looks like a strobe light). I have tried changing all suggested settings and have not had any luck fixing the issue. Don't waste your money on a game that is unplayable which is dissapointing because this game looked like it had a good plot and gameplay.
373870,Sister’s Secrecy: Arcanum Bloodlines - Premium Edition,"Didn't really enjoy it. The story wasn't engaging, and the different areas/scenes felt disjointed from each other. Adding to that the item quests don't feel like they have any purpose other than being there for progression sake.  The puzzles weren't bad, but the bonus chapter had more interesting ones, even though itself was very lackluster.  "
373880,Fleeting Ages, Early Access Review
37390,Gemini Lost,"To be honest, this is more of an idle game than anything but it costs 4.99. I wouldnt reccomend buying it when there are other free titles that offer the same thing, if not better."
373920,Eisenhorn: XENOS,"This is a good game. Not some muliplayer nonsense but a game focused on story, campaign and character. What is good in addition is the low graphics. 1. it feels like the old 'Fire Warrior' game for the playstation. 2. low for my laptop as my own graphics card cant handle all these big games too busy focused on too much details. Eisenhorn focuses more on teh story, with small graphics that dont clog up what this game is really about.  The story is great, i never bothered at first with the Inquisition as i keep seeing them as bullies to the imperium but the character shows me that not all of them are madmen hell bent on blowing up a planet. Its about a man/detective/spy of the imperium focusing on taking down the enemies of the imperium on worlds that have not/or yet affected by the war or invasions.   The story is well paced out and i do like a bit of the combat. Little tricky at first because of the controls being from combat to non combat but slowly getting the hang of it. Thank you for allowing us to use a chainsword and many more weapons.  However, I must say a few negative points 1. Some of the animation or sound effects with the weapons could be a little bit better, for example the lasguns, bolters and shotguns. Not always imediate to see if i am being shot at and i like to see exploding bodies when shooting. 2. The companions or the individuals that accompany you could fight a little bit better. 3. A few small touches to the animation like facial expressions for examlpe.  Amazng work to the team that made this game. Hope to see another Eisenhorn or a similar game based on another book(s) of the warhammer 40k with the same graphics for us peeps ^^"
373970,Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey Remastered,"I was really interested in this game when I initially saw it in Steam. Waited for a while for it to get on sale here before I bought it and when I finally started to play it ... I was very disappointed. The words this game knows are quite odd (hebrew alphabet?) and the words it does not know (parmesan? really?). If this was a 25cent game on a mobile, I could and would recommend it but at this price, it's just a waste of money. Avoid."
373990,Metrico+,"    Metrico+ is a fun, info graphic inspired platformer, that unfortunately suffers from lack of replayability"
37400,"Time Gentlemen, Please!","  Standard point and click adventure. Albeit i had fun, wouldn´t recommend paying more than one dollar for it. Play it if there is nothing else to play."
374010,Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: The Case of the Mummy’s Curse,"The playtime shown is not accurate, as I starting chatting on my phone after a while, the game was so boring that I just clicked through.  I don't mind that it's an old game and I don't mind the simple mechanics. Maybe through the rose glasses of nostalgia it seems worth it, but it's not. I'd rather play Solitaire.  I bought this game as part of a bundle and, honestly, it wasn't worth it. Too many things are common among the three games, making me think the developer milked three games out of one. With a playtime of about 40 minutes if you're slow (no skipping anything) for each game, I wouldn't recommend it."
374030,Virginia,What???
374040,Portal Knights, Early Access Review
374060,Stairs,"Nice psychological horror, unfortunatelly with untapped potential, but still worth a try  Game has some interesting ideas, great sounds and deep story, but story is biggest + and also - of the game i think.The 3 stories are rly interesting .. only problem is that game won´t tell you much about it. I was wondering about it all the time playing it and even after the end it wasn´t clear at all. Then i found out that other people didn´t catch more info either. On steam hub you can find explained story from devs and its rly great, just you have to search for getting to know.. There are also some few other things as small bugs or broken achievements ...  It´s not the top horror game ever, but anyway i enjoyed it and i would recommend it to people who are used to these indie horror games and enjoying them same as me :)"
374080,Falcon,I don't have a damn clue what's going on        Also ♥♥♥♥ yeah I'm the only one that has a review on this game.

374240,Eternal Step,"Is this early access? The game had a ♥♥♥♥ing a tooltip below the menu saying i can only select one skill and not a damn clue on what i have to press to select it. After some radnom clicking and button mashing it just hanged. After i managed to start it, the game presented itself as a series of tiny floors with a crappy game mechanics and a random reward after finishing it. Sorry, it's not a rogue-lite it's a rogue-♥♥♥♥♥."
374320,DARK SOULS™ III,I might rage and say i hate this game but its honestly such a good game. If you take the time to learn the game and take the ♥♥♥ kicking you will soon realize what a fun time this game is.
374380,Revolution Under Siege Gold,this game sucks it barely loads to the main menu WTF 0/5
374400,VoiceBot,"This program is remarkable in every way. If you suffer from hand fatigue or tendonitis, then this program is a must. Its very easy to use and you can setup any game that uses keyboard/mouse controls. A desk mic or headset works fine and is very good at picking out your words. Highly recommend this."
374450,Cheats 4 Hire,A really nice game to sink some minutes here and there :D
374460,Impossiball,   Early Access Review
374510,The Last Dogma,Well that was dissapointing. The mouse sensitivity is ridiculous and there are no options to change it. My pc massively exceeds the recommended specs yet the game is laggy and constantly skipping frames. I like wierd games but this one is just ugly. At least its only a fiver
374520,Champions of Anteria,"Crash to desktop, never got it to run. Steam gave me a refund."
374630,Mactabilis,A nice little indie Shoot'em Up with a few twists.
374640,March of Industry,"This game is really good! It's simple, but has enough complexity to be challenging. I always like to play this game whan I have no other games in mind to play. It's relaxing, and a good puzzle, too"
374670,Ember Strike, Early Access Review
374680,Tiki Galore,"You're a tiki warrior hurling spears at your foes while you collect shrunken heads to gain special abilities. Like...where has this game been all my life!?!?  Seriously, its a fun game to play, I just wish more people would discover and play it. So far i've only played by myself, but I have a blast just running aorund chanting tribal jubberish and admiring the stunning visuals  I also love the customization feature of the tikis, customization and being able to make ones character unique, espesially in a multiplayer game, is a huge plus in my opinion  All in all, totally worth it. 3 bucks and bam, you instantly have a creative, fun little game that you and your buddies can have an absolute blast on"
374830,Defend The Highlands,"If you like Scotland buy this game, if you don't like Scotland however buy this game."
374950,ADventure Lib,"Well. It is very creative. I can say it is easy to beat. The voicing is a little awkward, as it has a sort of long pause between everything, and well. You will see. Get it if you dare. Maybe a fire-breathing potato will end your kitten's last life with butter and a toilet in the sewer with Elizabeth."
374990,Orc Slayer,"I love FPS's like this, fast and furious and a great world to explore. Would recommend to anyone who either loves Orcs or FPS games!! :)"
37500,Magnetis,Decent matching/tetris ish game
375000,Icarus-X: Tides of Fire,"Speed regulation is non-existent. When I play level 1 it runs about half speed (compared to the video on the store page). But level 2 runs too fast! (Improved somewhat by forcing V-Sync on in the options, but leaving me unsure what speed it's supposed to go at - If I have a 70hz display is that going to make the game run faster than on 60hz??)  Balancing is all over the place - I was making it through level 2 fairly easily, until one shot from the boss killed me outright from something like full health + 1/4 shield - and it didn't even look like a big attack, just a small yellow homing bullet.  The shield getting smaller and making it easier to dodge as it takes damage isn't a bad idea, but if a single hit can knock off my shield and kill me in one go (even though the bullet would have been miles off hitting me if I didn't have a shield), that's just annoying.  Normal enemies on level 3 seemed far too tough to be fun, and none of the weapons in the shop were significant upgrades so I stopped there.  Also, the joypad support on menus is pretty rubbish - you have to drive the mouse pointer around (without even analog input)"
375010,Energy Balance,        YouTube™ Video:  Steam Cleaning - Energy Balance&nbsp;
375020,Al Emmo's Postcards from Anozira,Issues with the graphics and mouse (Graphics are blurry and very weird and the mouse (for me) jumps around a lot)). You can apparently find skip tokens in the game but if you're like me and hate a certain type of puzzle (slide puzzles) and it's the second puzzle in the game which means you won't have any skip tokens....this game might make you rage quit and just never play it again. =p
375030,Korwin The Game,"I like the idea, I think it's quirky, but this game is kinda unenjoyable. The jumping is really awful. You have to wait to be able to jump again for a while after you land, and you sometimes it's hard to jump out of places, so you get stuck. It's also hard to differentiate the background from interact-able foreground objects."
375040,Death Tractor,Night Farming simulator 2015 this game is noice.  
375120,Super Star Path,"I'm a sucker for finishing games, so my anger here is a result of that drive. This is a 25 minute game (to beat) artificially extended by an extremely aggravating difficulty level. The game almost admits it by letting you keep items you've already gathered in the stage. I assume they added that so players didn't lose their damn minds. But after you brave the stage, you'd better be ready to dodge bullets like Neo. Oh, and you may have 2or 3 life bar pieces if you're lucky (probably only 1-2), but don't worry, they sprinkle in more bullets and extra enemies with the later bosses to take care of that.  Can you beat the game? Yes, but you're going to play the same F'ing level over and over again until you luck out and kill the boss. Don't get me wrong, you still need to bring your Gradius 'A' game to dodge the boss's bullets. You won't accidentally kill it, that's for sure. But it's just redundant and tired. Maybe if they let you just play against the boss once you've beat the level (collected everything), but again, then the game would only be 25 minutes long."
375130,Tin Star,Utterly amazing. Beautiful throw back to the days of yore. Beautiful story that imerses you from the begining to end. Totally recommend.
375170,Gunpowder,"Definitely a one trick pony. It does what it does well, graphics are cute, style is maintained, but it just gets dull. New mechanics are introduced which spice things up a bit but not enough to make it compelling enough for me to continue playing. I could see hard core puzzle folks into it though. More of a phone game than anything."
375180,Lunch Truck Tycoon,As dumb as a bag of used panties at the thrift store and less entertaining than breathing.
375190,VROOM: Aerie,"Ok, it seems i'm the first one to buy this game and the first one to review it.  I really liked the idea. I like reproduction of mundane life in games. Although i don't have a VR, i wanted to give it a shot and bought it, but... When you push 'Play' on Steam you spawn in a elevator with a Warning message for Oculus users and that's it. No controls instructions, no menu, no game options, no nothing. I don't know if it's like this because i don't have VR, but ok. My review is not based on this matter.   The graphics and modeling are good. But the apartment is very, very small (My GTA Online Apartment is bigger). As far as i explored it has only one room (living room/kitchen). The other door is locked and other has a   Shark (!)  . Almost all the objects has some interation, but most of them just make sounds. When you go to the balcony theres no ambient sound (the game doesn't have ambient sound at all). The city below you is silent.  The 'small as a ant or 10 feet tall' feature is just a button you press to go 'no clip' style, floating.  Because it's not stated it's early access or beta in the store page, i'm assuming this is the final version. So, no... Don't buy it."
375200,Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1,"Short yuri VN thats graphic but not emitioal. Choices don't seem to matter, and it seems very unfinished. The sound and art are pretty good, but there isn't much else I care for here: it needs more and better writing and/or some interesting gameplay.  Sakura Dungen was much the same, except with 5X the content, a better story and characters and and stuff to do (its an auctual dungen crawler game with combat).  I figured I'd try Sakura Fantasy since Sakura Dungen was auctually pretty good, but I don't think its worth the time. Not horrible, but its little more than a vessal for some erotic yuri scenes."
375210,Unveil,"This game constantly crashes and the developer has no idea why. It keep s freezing on my computer after the first two minutes. The really sad thing is that it worked for the first couple of times I played and i am no longer able to get a refund. I have tried looking up solutions but all it says is that the interface has a problem. I have a gaming computer with a separate ideo card not an integrated one. Although, it was really interesting for the first couple of hours I haven't been able to play it since."

375230,"Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade","I once gave this game a decent review in the past, I claimed it was fun to play at it's core and the development team were good people. Sadly can't say the same on both accounts now. The broken melee meta that has developed (And not been fixed) has spoilt any fun I used to have and the devlopment team, once friendly, open and communintive with their playerbase, have retreated from their forums due to the critisms they recieve and have quickly developed a patern of hostility and unprofessionalism towards their paying customers.  Links taken from this great review, which in turn was taken from another review that got removed by the devs who filed a complaint to steam:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wiawyr/recommended/375230/    ---  ' 'oomanz (dev) calling players whiny and entitled:  https://i.imgur.com/QJ5I9ao.png  nathan (lead dev or something) bullying someone in discord:  https://puu.sh/s7IkD/68bcff716d.png  then nathan complaining about being bullied:  https://puu.sh/s72Wi/45d9fa7a90.png  nathan telling customers to burn in hell:  https://i.imgur.com/ImngIyG.png   These images were posted on another review here, by Valnak. The lead developer, Nathan, flagged this review with Steam to try to hide it, claiming it violated community guidelines, because of the embarrassing content in those images.  This is the lead dev talking about that review in their discord:  https://puu.sh/sL6Oj/5c5019324a.png  And further:  https://puu.sh/sL6Zv/6b77e64993.png  '  ---  I wish I didn't put so much money into this game. The devs bit off way more than they could chew with this project, and even with it being scaled down to a more standard lobby shooter it's still terribly overpriced and totally unfinished."
375250,Pizza Express,"cute game but the pixel art font is horrible, also the tutorial is pretty annoying, main menu is done wrong also.."
375290,Superstatic,It's like Hotline Miami but you can possess people and use them to kill other guards. It's not bad just not as tightly packed or frantic as HM.
375310,Mighty Switch Force! Hose It Down!,"Is it just me or is that last puzzle a fryer?  The Good News: Signature Wayforward art style; cute girls abound, and a plucky lead. Jake Kaufman's pumpin' music score makes for a memorable soundtrack. Some clever mechanical twists in this smart puzzler.  The Bad News: You may be better off purchasing the soundtrack - go ahead, it's on Bandcamp. I got a lot more enjoyment from the music alone, compared to this super short pipeline puzzler. The difficulty is bog standard until the end where it spikes in an absurd manner. Also, what is the point of those silly timers if you're just aiming at your own scores?  Recommendation: The mobile pedigree of this title shows through the veneer of a lazy PC port. It's fun, but you can do better for the asking price. Dissappointing if you're coming from the mainstream Mighty Switch Force series. Look for a sale."
375320,Colortone,"controls are too awkward &amp; doesnt have the option to invert the y axis. what game doesnt have this option anymore? i still want to recommend to people who dont need to invert but i couldnt get past level 2, so i cant say if its actually worth it."
375330,Butsbal,mhhhh alright kinda fun just you cant exit out the game
375420,The Architect,On a mac. Controller doesn't work at all. 100% unplayable. Complete waste of money and time. PROTIP: Don't port a game to mac if you're not going to bother to make it work. AWFUL. DO NOT PLAY.  There is simply no excuse for saying a game works on mac but obviously not bothering to playtest.
375430,The Logomancer,"When the artwork in your game (AND it's Steam cards) is worse than the pictures I draw, then you know something went wrong."

375460,16bit Trader,"Broken and abandoned, for those who read this I suggest filing a report because 4-5 of the achievements are broken and impossible to obtain without using SAM.  As if they thought it would be a good idea to even add an achievement to a game that you can polish off in a couple hours to play it overall for 240 hours...lmao."
375480,Chronicon, Early Access Review
375500,The Deep Paths: Labyrinth Of Andokost,"A few seconds after startup the game goes to a blue screen with a red cursor. Not like a BSOD, just... an uninteractive field of soft blue. Completely unplayable.  I will be seeking a refund and I suggest not buying it. I can run games like Total War: Warhammer on ultra without a hitch, so this is clearly due to lack of proper testing.  Edit: upon further testing from the dev and another customer, it was discovered that Malwarebytes and Windows Defender (and possibly other AV suites?) interfere with the game on some level. Adding an exception got it running nicely, and I can happily change this to a thumbs up now.  Back to kicking bubblegum and chewing ♥♥♥."

375620,CortexGear:AngryDroids,doesn't actually work on mac or linux
375680,Apartment 666,"Played it for ten minutes. They have to literally force hints down your throat so you have a remote idea of what to do. It's a VERY clear PT copy, with the unexplainable repitition of the hallway with different variations every cycle and the 'thing' chasing you and 'scaring' you. Voice acting, obviously, crap. Utter crap. I've heard better English dubbed Russian pornos.  All in all, this indie game is a waste of money and thank GOD I got it at a severe discount through ♥♥♥."
375710,The Adventures of Mr. Bobley,This game is basically Skyrim
375770,Quantum Conscience,"An entertaining visual novel with likable characters, a cool story, and a neat gameplay concept!"
375790,Build 'n Bump,The game itself may be small but it is very fun if you have a friend that plays it
375820,Human Resource Machine,I like logical puzzle games. I kinda liked human resource machine but eventually stopped for only one reason: Everyone who's programming at least a bit knows good code is primarily readable code. This game however doesn't let me write readable code. The way the code is presented is confusing. I feel like spending more time understanding my code than actually solving the puzzle.
375840,Rytmik Ultimate,"This is great! But I have a question. I have ultimate and the chiptune designer, I still don't get the full set of tracks which I'm curious how I can get them. It shows them! but they won't let me use them. It just is like they are unavalible to use. Thanks!"
375850,Island Defense,Simple enough game. Great to widdle away small amounts of time. Good enough challenge at times.
375900,Trackmania Turbo,"ENG.: Why did they done that? I loved Trackmania games, but there is no custom skins in this version...  + Fast gameplay + Relaxing + Map editor + Lots of maps and multiplayer + Car customization + 4 types of maps  - Little boring - NO CUSTOM SKINS!!!!!!  In my personal opinion 7.5/10 if they add custom skins I can give 8.5-9/10  PL.: Dlaczego zrobili to? Kochałem gry TrackMania, ale nie ma niestandardowych skórek w tej wersji ...  + Szybka rozgrywka + Relaksuje + Edytor map + Wiele map i multiplayer + Dostosowanie samochodów + 4 Rodzaje map  - Troche nudzi - NIE MA NIESTANDARDOWYCH SKÓREK!!!!!!  W mojej osobistej opinii 7.5 / 10, jeżeli dodadzą te niestandardowe skórki mogę dać 8,5-9 / 10"
375910,Anno 2205,"*** SUPER UPDATED ***  I liked this game. But then the Tundra DLC released and suddenly I could no longer play it. No big deal, I guess, I was pissy but that didn't make the base game bad.  All my attempts at getting a refund or a fix were ignored, which made me more pissy.  Now they've released a DLC that season pass and Gold Edition buyers will have to purchase.   THIS IS NOT OKAY UBISOFT.   UPDATED  It's hard to give a review for this game.  I'm a big fan of previous Anno games, and I've spent a lot of time with Anno 2070, doing little side missions, replaying the main content, continuous games... I never did multiplayer, admittedly, because I'm not a huge fan of acknowledging other people even exist, let alone let them invade my game.  I reccommend this game... with some stipulations. This is a great game, but it seems Anno fans will have to give it a little time before it gets really great. The complexity is still there, and don't let anyone tell you different. They just haven't played it long enough.  Here's my pros and cons list.  PROS:  +This game is BEAUTIFUL. I mean, absolutely astounding. I played on both low and ultra graphics, and I must say it is spectacular on all counts, little details are so satisfying I don't mind ignoring gameplay for a few moments just to watch the little people move around in the buildings.  +The characters are intriguing. For a city building game, anyway. I'm visiting new areas and I'm seeing people who, admittedly, are cliches. The Lunar faction bad guy might a well wear a Darth Vader costume, and 'Mysterious Woman' is a strange way to hold emissary to the big space station. But I enjoy their presence for the most part, even if they like repeating the same phrases in heavily accented English.  +Accessible, easy to understand gameplay. The moment you begin, you jump right into the game. I was expecting a tutorial of some sort, but it's streamlined easily into the entire system, a rather fantastic setup. I don't mind the lack of other game options, for now, but I'm also not far into the game. There IS that little bothery feeling that the story will end and I'll be left bored, or have to start over to play more.  +Interface. Besides being beautiful, clean, and simple, you get to see exactly what the load balances for your economy are. This means you know exactly what you need to balance the lines, and admittedly, this change might make previous Anno game players feel like it's TOO simple now. Before, you just had to sort of guess: or look up schematics online for high-efficiency building layouts.  CONS:  (This one is no longer valid, as of 10 hours playing the game. It got complicated pretty fast.) -It DOES feel like baby's first city builder. It's simplified, no doubt, and the added interface telling you exactly what you need only makes it easier. Eventually the difficulty ramps up once you colonize new lands and have to balance your needs, but your workforce doesn't seem as demanding, and without any sort of trade ships and storage, it remains a simple act of adding more weight to one side in order to balance things. Only rarely have I really messed up and had to do damage control.  -No multiplayer. As I've said, I don't do multiplayer. But I've seen a large number of people complain about it, and seeing how there's only one game mode, I can see why the value should exist. There should be SOME other option to enjoy, instead of this on-the-rails experience.  -Lack of Lore. In my opinion, this world is very interesting. I like seeing all the little details, and I like hearing a vague idea of how the factions work and fit together. But I want more story, I want to know what it was like 100 years ago, or how exactly my new implants are changing the population of my people.  TL;DR Anno 2205 is a really beautifully constructed koi pond. It's great to look at, maybe even jump into, but if you're looking for depth and power, you won't find it. Everything you see is right on the surface, and jumping in only gets you wet and wishing there were more.  Nonetheless, I give it a thumbs up because... while it's just a kiddie pool, it's a pretty damn fun kiddie pool. But then again, I'm a pretty casual player, so I don't mind the simplicity. If you don't mind a simple, good-looking game, I suggest you jump right in and splash around. But do it somewhere else, there's no multiplayer.  EDIT: I'll update this once I've gotten about 12 hours, as per Shynx's suggestion.  UPDATE: I tried to wait the full 12 hours, but I'll stick with 10.  I take back the con about this being a simple game. At first? Yes. Very simple. But then I colonized the arctic and the moon, and now it's getting fun. There IS a storage system, I just never noticed it until I did a quest relating to it. There's also a rather significant amount of balancing compared to what I originally thought, because with the addition of modules, it can make things VERY dynamic. Plus, I just bought out a weaker company, and man, that feels good.  On a side note, I've barely noticed uPlay is there. It popped up for a few seconds asking for the activation code in the beginning, and now it's almost as if it doesn't exist.  TL;DR The more I play this game, the more I like it. I wouldn't call it a disappointment to the series at all."
375930,Trap Them,"I would like to recommend this puzzle game, but I can't. The difficulty ramps up too quickly and the solutions sometimes depend on poorly defined or explained rules.  I assume the game isn't very popular because I soon as I got stuck on a level, I really got stuck. I couldn't find any useful Youtube videos or walkthroughs. So unless your really good at puzzle games I can't recommend this one. "
375950,Viridi,IRL succulents too hard to maintain? Want an immortal snail pet? This game is for you.  Why do I keep log in every week for a couple minutes to water digital plants?
37600,Windosill,"It's wayyyy too short for the cost. This should be a $.99 game. There are only around seven scenes. Great idea, but not worth the cost. I was really disappointed."
376110,Black Island,"This pnc is quite good considering it's the developers first game. I paid £2, which is a fair price being 1 hour of gamemplay. Helsinki Noir is onto something here. The story is quite compelling, reminds me of the film Memento only darker. The cinematic cut scenes and audio is very well done, clearly the devs forte.  The graphics are ok. I was intrigued by the wavy effect seen throughout the game, although it was not consistent. The tree by the car is not wavy, but every other tree is. It almost feels like a PS liquify filter was applied to cover up what wasnt a good image but overall it makes it a bit surreal. It would have been cool to use the effect to point out hints, like the tree that doesnt look wavy is the one you have to do something with?   The puzzles are a little simple and too obvious (find key and use it in door, find number and type it in the keypad). The only puzzle that made me think a little bit was Peg Solitaire. Hopefully the next chapter will have more clever puzzles."
376120,Assault CorpsII,"♥♥♥♥♥IEST ♥♥♥♥ IN THE WORLD. Really. I normally dont use these Words. But here, Are you kidding me? Did a totally money-sucking 3 year old program this???"
376130,Illuminascii,"I am just wondering how it took 7 days for the developer make a very interesting game from the ground up (On the annual 7 Day FPS Contest), but a year and half later the paid version is, overall, barely superior both in content and quality. I swear that it is like someone hacked the developer's computer, stole the (unfinished) game and launched it on Steam.  If you saw the trailers, what you see is what you get, but to be honest, as much as I like certain aspects of this game, it just feels lazy and ends up being broken. There is absolutely no reason to buy this as there is barely a difference from the free 7DFPS version from where this game came from plus the fact that it featured randomly generated cutscenes that are missing in this version.  What do I mean by broken and lazy:  -The clue finding levels involve you searching containers around the level area for an X number of clues and leave the area when you have them. You interact with the container and there is a (fair) chance that it drops a clue for you to pick up. The problem is that as long as you haven't picked up the clues, you still have the chance to have the containers drop more of them. And NO there is not the excuse of 'it is not broken because that X is the minimum your character needs' because the clues stop dropping once you get all you need.  -Some doors are locked and need a key, but you can kick down all doors. Noticed the problem there?  -On the title screen it says: 'Press f6 to clear data'. What data? There are no savegames and there is not any kind of leaderboard.  -The UI is a mess and don't get me started on the you-can-only-navigate-down-the-item-column inventory.  -Though there are plenty of lovely ASCII based weapon sprites, the reload animation is the same for ALL of the weapon tipes and they end up only being different in the stats.  -The gameplay ends up being boring. As you beat the levels, the enemies get more HP and deal more damage. You find better weapons to deal more damage and level up you character.  -The outdoor levels are shamelessly defined by a black wall of nothing.  -No key rebinding.  -It is badly optimized.  -Strangely enough, what is shown in ASCII is actually neatly detailed: interact with lamps and they turn on/off, interact with shower heads and sinks and they drop ASCII water. touch fireplaces and you get burn damage, etc."
376140,SAGA,fun and you can ern credits for boosters you can find gear for your units they lvl up too its old but i think its a gem
376150,Industry Transporters, Early Access Review
376160,DNO Rasa's Journey,well this game is uh... well different. I like it but i think theres a couple bugs need fixing... but im not sure if they are bugs xD. Its kinda confusing but i think you enjoy it.
376210,The Isle, Early Access Review
376240,Hadean Lands,Would be great if a full-screen option would be offered. Currently the window chrome is a little distracting...
376250,Ground Breakers,"When I first run this... I saw the Unity splash screen. Bad sign.  Next, it kept crashing on exit (tested). Another bad sign.  Then, I saw how horrible the English was.  Not playing this.    So this review got downvoted so much in under 24 hours. Probably friends of the developer... who sucks pretty bad. Don't buy the game, there are a lot better out there. There is a reason nobody bought this. Wait until it's 90% off or more. I regret getting it at 50 off."
376300,GUILTY GEAR Xrd -SIGN-,"After being somewhat disappointed by another recent fighting game purchase, Guilty Gear Xrd was a pleasant surprise. I never played any of the guilty gear series other than in passing before so I am not a long time fan of the series. That said, I love the graphics and the game runs smoothly on my Asus Zenbook (with the 960M). This game is worth the money, and if you pick it up during one of the steam sales, its an even better bargain.   I can tell I am going to be logging a tonne of hours in this as there is quite a bit to learn. If you are a fighting game fan, you will definitely want to check it out."
376310,Otherland,"Otherland is Great, if you play MMO's but like them to be very broken, and pretty much aweful, in every sense of the word.  I had physical, emotional, metaphysical diarraha, from playing this trash-piece of a game.  It sucks, dont but it, I played 6 hours and it was a serious mistake.  RON PAUL 2016"
376350,OVERGRAVITY,It's an ok multiplayer shooter. The gravity aspect awas cool. But the game was pretty laggy and it was hard to find people to play with. Also the constant rotation made me motion sickness. Would have been better I think if the camera didnt' rotate so much.
376450,Last Days of Old Earth,"Much to simple. Especially for $29.99. I was falling asleep while playing, literally."
376480,Ohr,"  אור is hard to pin a genre down on it, just like pretty much every other game made by Railslave.   At a first look it might seem a bit bizarre, you're thrust right into the game with small, yet direct instructions and then left to your own devices to explore. A mix of platforming, bullet hell and a little bit of beat em up mechanics are there to get you through the game. The music is nice and well made (similar style to other railslave stuff, so give those a listen to get an idea of the music here).  I think it's got a good balance of length/explanation, as it takes a while to figure out all the nuances in the game and difficulty to keep you interested but without it feeling tedious. It's harsh in many aspects, but with a little getting used to things you'll be fine :) I'd go as far as to say the replays are needed to pick up parts of the story that you might not understand at first.  Give it a go if you like Railslave stuff, if you're still uncertain and want an idea of what the gameplay is like check out some of the other games made by him, they're just as bizarre :p though game play mechanics aren't always the same.   P.s. The giraffe from Uriels Chasm is back :D"
376520,Kelvin and the Infamous Machine,"Love this game! The plot is enjoyable and the comedy is great. The puzzles get gradually more difficult which is a nice touch. The only thing I can complain about is the slow walking speed of the character, but this is a miniscule detail. I truly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys point and click games!"
376560,Big Fish Legend, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJgmAgvXd2M 
376570,WildStar," http://massivelyop.com/2016/03/10/massively-overthinking-the-state-of-wildstar/  this will explain the state of the game far better then I ever could.  Now lets begin. I am not a level 0 troll account and I have played wildstar off and on since launch and have several high level and maxed characters. I love/loved this game. It was science fiction with humor...silly jokes and a story that was actually pretty deep if you paid attention to it. The housing was and continues to be the reigning champion. Sorry FF14 your housing is ♥♥♥♥. Wildstar housing is perfect.   Gameplay. Now I know it's changed over the years and they've tried to add some content and easier access for casuals, but it took so damn long to do. Most people got impatient and left. I also know theres a lot of bugs, topics about bugs, the skeleton crew running the game, players saying its active, players saying its not. its dying, its on life support...its not. blah blah blah.  ignore all of that if you wish and try for youself. But don't dismiss it as trolling, there are grains of truth in everything said.  I wish and hope steam breaths new life into this game. It was a beautiful game, fun to play. But as ive logged in sporadically through the year,...and yes today on steam(given my low play time here) its empty to me, the game feels so desolate and deserted to what I remember.   Key phrase. How I remember the game.  the game itself, gameplay wise is great...but Im worried about this games future..the lack of content, how NCsoft treats games that don't 'sell well'. I use that term loosely, as again you will find people on both sides. Its doing well, its not doing well.   its free, so try it for yourself. But keep in mind both the article and what others have to say about the game.  Making this review psotive because there is no 'maybe' and because I really want people to see both sides of the game. But yes, it is enjoyable for what it is, its just the state of the game that has me worried."
376680,Splendor,"Enjoyed the game for as long as I was able to play it. Unfortunately, I get a 'Not enough faction for number of players selected (6)' error message and the game will no longer load. Attempted a restart of my system and uninstalled/reinstalled the game on my machine. Nothing thus far has rectified the issue. Was looking forward to providing more of a review of the game itself, but can't really get into it with problems like these existing. It seems as though Days of Wonder threw the Steam version of this game in as something of an afterthought, and the bugginess of the game shows this. I wouldn't bother."
376730,Monument,"Now this game isn't TERRIBLE. But its pretty bad. I got it for 59 cents which I still don't think is a good price. Your frames will drop so low its almost unplayable. The sensitivity is so slow even when the sensitivity is all the way high. No custom choosing your graphics you have to choose from settings like this: Low, Medium, High kinda like that. The game gave me a headache on how loud the menu music is. The game is made from Unity. I would stay away. I don't think the developer supports this game anymore (speculation only)."
376750,World War II GI,"World War 2 GI is a game that was far behind its time back in 1999. Day of Defeat was released in the same year, and it is superior in graphics when compared to WW2 GI. But let us put that aside for a moment.  This game is fustrating, unfair, confusing and incomplete. But it is still one of my favourite retro fp i have ever had the pleasure of playing. The saving every 2 minutes in case you die should not be something you have to do in a game, but i'm ok with that. The enemies are impossible to attack front on and the fight comes down to a 'who can shoot the fastest and hope the gun doesn't miss competition', but again i'm completely ok with that.  The thing that i love most about this game is that it is Doom + Medal of Honour. The computer allies is one of the biggest things i adore about this game, even if they don't actually move on their own and follow a basic programmed scripted. I don't care. The level design is interesting and offers a non-linear map, where you can choose your own path through the level to reach the end.  Overall this game is looked down upon because it is heavily dated, but if you are a classic retro gamer like me, you'll love it."
376760,Big Thinkers Kindergarten, I MADE IT OUT! Once you start this game you're traped! Those a*sholes will lock you up and force you to play with them.  But I'm ready to take on Grade 1!  1/10
376770,Big Thinkers 1st Grade,"Well, I bought this game because I have fond memories of this game from when I was the target audience of Big Thinkers. I'm actually surprised by how well it aged over the years since it first came out. There's no reason to buy it as an adult unless you're like me and just want to relive your childhood. If you have kids, though, this is still a top notch edutainment game."
376780,Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: The Case of the Tin Soldier,"Disappointing and frustrating menu system interrupts the flow of the game. You are given a ridiculous number of locations/people (a whole alphabet of them) to visit before you could possibly conceive a reason to visit any/many of them. All you seem to be able to do is 'visit' locations and generate a video of the characters at that location. I cant see a way of searching locations (even the crime scene) or asking characters questions. There are no hints about what to do next, so the only course of action seems to be to visit location after location from the long list and see more video conversations. The so called 'Clues' in the notebook section of the menu seem to just be a statement of facts you've already witnessed so what is the point of them?! Even for the price, I am dissappointed. It's like a visual novel but without any sort of pathway trhough it or real interactivity."
376790,Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: The Case of the Mystified Murderess,"I bought this game as part of a bundle and, honestly, it wasn't worth it. Too many things are common among the three games, making me think the developer milked three games out of one. With a playtime of about 40 minutes if you're slow (no skipping anything) for each game, I wouldn't recommend it.  Actually, I braved through the other two games, but I couldn't bring myself to endure this one. I uninstalled after 10 minutes or so. I could see where this was going and I wasn't interested.   Spare the 5 bucks for a nice cup of coffee."
376870,Minecraft: Story Mode - A Telltale Games Series,"Very entertaining creation by Telltale! Definitely worth the money paid, even the bonus DLC episodes. The fact that without the DLC the game comes to a rather sudden and unsatisfactory halt is a fair criticism,but the only one I have of this game. I reccommend this game AND the DLC, especially the collaboration bonus episode the DLC starts with actual Minecraft Youtubers. If you enjoy a good story-driven game that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a fair share of fun characters, this game's for you. :)  Personally, I never took to Minecraft because I'm not one for open-world Sandbox games. This game here gave me a way to enjoy 'Minecraft' in my own way. Much appreciated."

377080,Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star,"paying money for this so called 'game' would be huge waste of money .. i only spent less than 10 minutes and i felt like vomiting ... what was that! ... it's a bunch of birds talking and talking .. and talking .. and .. yes .. more talking ... i kept hitting enter rapidly hoping i see something that keeps me from exiting the 'game' .. i don't know what the story about , didn't even have the stomach to read some of the bla bla bla .. even the birds are just a bunch of photographs of birds from the internet .. didn't even have the decency to draw them!"
377120,Chronicle Keepers: The Dreaming Garden,"Do not purchase this game. I was lucky I only paid less than a dollar when it was on a major sale but the game crashes to desktop when you break a wall with a pickaxe. I Googled the error and apparently this has been the same bug the game has had since 2014 and nothing was done to fix it. I don't care how cheap it is, it is a waste of money if you cannot play it past a certain point.   I don't know if anyone else got it to work but I could not. Too bad because I may have given it a better review if the bug was ever fixed."

377190,Pale Echoes,"Asides from having to play in a ridiculously small window, this game is an absolute gem. I'd buy it with or without the discount. Also, I love puzzling around in the battles, it is very unique.  It also happened to help me in a card game called Coup.... WHO SAID THAT GAMES WERE USELESS"
377200,Daemon Detective Gaiden,I was hoping for a fun retro platformer like on NES (famicom to you easterners) but instead this is just tedious and really bad controls.   Music is cool though. Would buy the soundtrack.
377250,Subaeria, Early Access Review
377290,Biodrone Battle,"I like games with a retro feeling, though I do not play originals because I think they were great at their time but fall back compared with modern retro games. Biodrone Battle took my interest because Paradroid was one of my favorite games and I think this is a nice remake. It it faster, got more action (as far as I remember) but also has its moments of tension when you got chased by a droid, escape into another room, hide and watch your confused haunter. Graphics is somewhat basic or retro-like but lights and explosions give a tense ambience."
377310,The Tower Of Elements,"  Hand-Eye coordination simulator, git gud. Has been updated so you can no longer simply spam to win. Achievements DO work now, may need to exit game for them to appear.  Best played on a controller.  Doesn't allow key mapping."
377330,Close Your Eyes,This game was too intense for me. I could not finish it
377360,Western Press,"Fun lil game. Replayability is low for me though... especially without any online matches available. I recommend, on discount, I suppose."
377430,Who Is Mike,"I don't like this game. It has interesting story, but without checking most of endings you have no idea if you did well or not at the end. Also 95% of choices are Tell the truth/Lie, even if you are beeing asked if you are the real one. You can lie. What is the point of it? Both answers are 'Yes, I am Mike'. It's too complicated and not that good."
377450,Lost Lands: Dark Overlord,"I really enjoyed this game while it's story is common the puzzles and hidden object challenges make up for it. A word of advice if you are hunting for achievements it's best to read the achievements before even playing as on some you only get one chance and if you fail you will need to replay the whole story after finishing the game. I got over 10 hours of entertainment and for me that made it worth buying. Also if you get stuck there is a in game guide that you can use to look up the solution to everything, but it's best to try not to use it imo unless you are totally stumped."
377460,Chicken Invaders 3,"I don't really like shoot 'em up games, actually I tend to hate them. But Chicken Invaders is the exception. I love it, I loved it when I played it ten years ago and I still play it enthusiastically today. It actually has a very fun story, really.  My biggest happy factor is that I used to play it on my WinMe, and the Steam game runs on my Win10 like it hasn't aged a day. If someone doesn't know the game they might think it's retro, not actually old.  I recommend this game."
377480,N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure,  Same developers as Adam's Venture: Origins and same problems. Booted up on wrong monitor Had to restart multiple times to get right display &amp; resolution Wasn't able to play because default keybindings were QWERTY while I have an AZERTY keyboard and you can't change the keybindings
377500,Prismatica,spin to win  get frustrated with the spinning controls  wonder why they split normal and challenge into separate modes even though normal is just challenge but with the optional stars for time and moves removed  still have fun  spin to win
377520,Pike and Shot: Campaigns,"This is a brilliant ghame at the tactical level, with realistic attrition, losses and manouevre. However, on the strategic level the game is disappointing. The maps need enlarging and improvement, something along the lines of AGEOD games, although not necessarily quite as detailed. Hopefully future updattes will see this excellent game strategically beefed up. 7/10 so far. With a better strategic map could be 9/10."
377530,侠客风云传(Tale of Wuxia),Steam ! the game crashed on the opening scene ! Resolve this !
377550,Unfair Jousting Fair,This game is the best jousting fair simulator I've played all week!  Please go buy this game!  It's real good.
377570,Space Drifters 2D, Early Access Review
377590,IRFaceRig,"Ok if anyone who wants this on a Lenovo Windows 8.1, DON'T GET IT!!!!! IT DOESNT WORK!!!"
377600,Tcheco in the Castle of Lucio,"Two things I'd like to say before the actual review: I don't usually write reviews. Also, I completely respect the developer's effort to deliver the best possible game. With that said, here it goes...  1) The game has no options. None, whatsoever. You can't change the resolution or the controls. Let me say it again: it has NO options. This is completely unnaceptable for a PC game. 2) Good luck finding out what the jump button is on the keyboard, because the game doesn't tell you anywhere (it's Z, by the way) 3) Same thing room after room: avoid baddies. get key. unlock exit. That's it.  I had high hopes for this game, and was happy when it was bundled. I dig a nice retro platformer. I can not, however, recommend it to anyone."
377660,Blockwick 2,A lovely sliding block game with plenty of content. I particularly liked the way you can keep playing with levels after finishing them so you don't have to replay the levels to go for the harder completion target.
377670,G-senjou no Maou - The Devil on G-String,"   Not sure if anyone's gonna read this but I haven't finished reading G-senjou no Maou, I'm still on chapter 5. I could've sworn there was no doubt that Kyousuke was Maou. I'm on the Haru Route, not sure if I read it during the route or before but I'm sure I read Maou admitting to himself as being Kyousuke. I didn't take any screenshots but I could've sworn he said he had recently became aware of his other half Azai Kyousuke. On multiple occasions the heroines witnessed him start talking like Maou. After Kyousuke would have his headache and supposedly become Maou he'd be in the exact same place Kyousuke just was. IMO it goes way beyond just tricking the reader into thinking Kyousuke was Maou with his forgetfulness and headaches. Example, when Kanon comes to Kyousuke's house to talk about her feelings and you tell her to talk about it later and she goes to take a shower, Kyousuke gets a headache and becomes Maou, Kanon says there's no towel and then Maou replies that he'll get one. So how is his brother secretly alive and is Maou all along?? And what was Kyousuke getting mad about his mother's death and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Haru about and threatening to kill her if he ever saw her again about? He showed absolutely no knowledge of her being the daughter of the man his father killed and even though he says he knew but pretended she was someone else why did he suddenly get angry about it? It was so weird there was no purpose, him being upset about his mother's death had nothing to do with Haru so why'd he get mad at her? And why did Kyousuke's adopted father save him from getting killed by his brother, he wasn't supposed to give a rat's ♥♥♥ about him. And why was Kyousuke suprised about Haru being the daughter of the famous violenist? How did he know that Haru was the daughter of the man his father murdered but not know who her mom was, especially concidering he had no memory of meeting her when they were kids at that point? I know Haru says she loves Kyousuke and was willing to smash but he said he ♥♥♥♥♥ her and said he'd kill her if he saw her again. That being said how on earth does she still like him and much more how does he like her? Literally nothing happened between them between him saying he'd kill her after he'd ♥♥♥♥♥ her and then him coming to rescue her from his brother and calling her his women and now acting like they're in love and smashing repeatedly. And after Kyousuke woke up in his house and was threatened by Gonzou's men and managed to get away with some idk even know questioning their mafia honor or something about robbing and killing him, he gets a call from Tsubaki, talks to her and then immediately says let's go kill Gonzou without a headache. So how is he not Maou?? Idk maybe I misreads somethings or something I just don't know.  I just feel like the story was sooo good until they revealed that Kyousuke wasn't Maou. It was starting to feel like the best visual novel I have ever read. When they revealed how Maou took the stock certificates from the breifcase because he was dressed up like a police man and nobody noticed I was LIKE OMGG that makes sense and is soo cool. I just thought it was pretty funny and thrilling story of how Kyousuke had a split personality who would've been trying to kill Gonzou and Haru and how they would try to find Maou not knowing it was Kyousuke all along, but then I get ♥♥♥♥ed over and everything I thought I knew was a lie. But the lie has so many holes in it it just doesn't make sense. I think I'm going to re:read through the parts I found inconsistent to make sure I haven't misread something.   "
377680,Sakura Beach,"Although the art is unique and well done, this particular Sakura VN is underwhelming, with (imo) a non likable MC, and just overall boring. For as short as it was, I almost wish I hadn't wated my time with it. If you want a good Sakura game, get Fantasy, Swim Club, or Santa."
377690,Starlight Vega,I hope you like having hot demons practically force themselves on you  because this game has quite a bit of that
377710,Idol Magical Girl Chiru Chiru Michiru Part 1,"10/10 chiruchiru best girl.  In all seriousness this is a great spinoff of the Grisaia games. Mostly light hearted humor, lots."
377720,Idol Magical Girl Chiru Chiru Michiru Part 2,"Though there are somethings that didn't go smooth in both scenarios and translations, I think the core story itself is a very fulfilling one for original Grisaia fans. Elements such as events, dialogues and expressions had marvelously emphasized the character without spoiling the original game. Cuteness enhanced to the MAX. ;w;  "
377840,FINAL FANTASY IX,"Disappointing. It's a good port, but the base game wasn't that great to begin with.  Final Fantasy IX, 'goes back to the roots of the Final Fantasy series', which root? The classic Final Fantasy should be about the four Warriors of Light with special power from the mother crystals, going on a journey to save the world. Final Fantasy IX doesn't have the crystal nor the job system. It's more like FFIV and VI where characters have unique job and abilities.  The setting feels more like a Disney cartoon where you have animals pretending to be human. The plot is about a princess who ran away from the castle with a thief. That princess also starts singing out of nowhere just like every Disney's princesses. Not that Disney is bad but it doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game.  The characters are so generic. You have the princess, the monkey thief, the knight, the black mage, and the rest is irrelevant characters who barely have anything to do with the main story.  The battle system is very slow. Even with the new option in this port that allow you to remove the intro before battles but the battle itself is still slow. It also has a huge lag before battles in this port. Trance is the worst 'limit break' system I've ever seen. A finishing move that you cannot choose when to use? really?  The character developmental system is not good. Maybe worse than FFVIII's Junction system. In FFIX you'll be forced to use inferior equipment in order to learn character abilities. It's annoying.  The card game is not as good as Triple Triad from FFVIII, and other minigames are boring.  The soundtracks are fine. I like many of them.  The port is very well done. I worried a bit because they ported it from Android version but it runs perfectly on my system. The graphics look fine, the new battle menu doesn't cause any issue to me so far. The 4:3 ratio with stupid side bars is lame though.  7/10 for the port.  5.5/10 for the base game. A decent JRPG but not that great.  2/10 for the FFIX fans who kept hating on people who don't think FFIX is the best of all-time. You people need to calm down and learn that people can have different opinions."
377860,Mushihimesama,"Absolutely terrible, and I'm a big fan of STGs games. The port is poorly done, and the game itself is awful."
377870,DARIUSBURST Chronicle Saviours,"I'm going to state straight away that this is one of the very best shmups ever and one of the greatest games ever made. And, actually, I don't even think it's quite the best Darius game, so that says a lot about how awesome this series is as a whole. As it stands, however, this is the best shmup on all of Steam (yes, even better than Ikaruga and DoDonPachi), and it will be a tough game to topple in terms of future releases.  It's not simply because of the sheer mass of content the game has, which, even if it's repetitive and the aesthetics are not as colorful and trippy as previous Darius games, equates to being far larger than any other shmup on the market with stages reaching into the thousands. It's because of the game's mechanics. One might say it's easy to make a game where you move a ship and shoot at enemies moving on screen. Whether that is true or not, the real difficulty is making a shmup truly stand out from the pack, and that's a major reason I'm a fan of Darius in general is how the game flows as you progress, particularly the flow of the enemies (they're space fish with fish-like patterns). As per usual with Darius, you can select your own path in this game within the variety of game modes, and the difficulty rises about as appropriately as can be possible in a game such as this. It does become death-heavy somewhat often, but as with the other Darius games, it says a lot when I die and proceed to say, 'I love this game.'  As a huge fan of shmups and especially Darius, I purchased this one straight away and have been in awe ever since, and I've only scratched the surface in terms of content I've delved through. This is one of my very highest recommendations on all of Steam. If the price seems steep, I can assure you it isn't, though I'll understand if you wait for a sale. But even at full price this game is more than well worth the money."
377880,Eternal Destiny,"*- Optimus gpu from laptop. Doesnt support nvidia even after force enabled control panel. Using intel gpu instead. intel crashes the game twice so far. Windows 10 64bit  If yr using a laptop with optimus and in windows 10, there is only support for intel gpu.  - Inconsistent frames rate 25-30 jumping.   - Game is stretch to fit 1080p. Game resolution is originally low"
377970,Void & Meddler,"Episode 1 is definitely a great start to this series. I look forward to the future for this game. It's got such a unique art style, interesting music and locations...and LOVE the dialogue. This game does take me back to old school point and click games where you won't always know what to do, but with a little observation and creativity, the puzzles aren't too hard. The answers to some are actually even kinda funny. All in all, please check this out if you're like me- looking for an off beat treasure in the massive sea of Steam lol"
377980,Mortos, Early Access Review
378030,Cardinal Quest 2,so much fun being a theif and just killing everything in sight 10/10 XD 
378070,Energy Hook,"Backed on kickstarter because it sounded cool, but it's just about unplayable. Nominating for 'game that makes me want to cry' award.   Honestly, I'm not that mad, I just need to review something for a badge. But, I do consider it to have been money attached to a balloon that some little girl down on street level is crying super loudly about having lost."
378080,Rack N Ruin,I recommend this game. It takes a couple hours for awesome gameplay to become apparent.
378100,Nyctophobia,"That moment when you do not know if it's scary or if it's bizarre, but an interresting game."
378110,Hack RUN,"I thought from the fact the game relies solely on a terminal interface that it would be a pretty realistic hackers-on-steroids style hacking game. I thought wrong.  Access account. Read email with 'cryptic' clue to next account's username and password. Repeat ad nauseam.  By the time I realised it wasn't going to get any better, I was 30 levels deep and had to keep going. Lucky it's only an hour and a half.  Buy this if: you're a baby with unusually low IQ for someone your age and are looking for something a little less challenging than your speak and spell you want to make hackers on CSI look realistic by comparison  'the letters you pause on when you sing the alphabet song' is the password hint from a level about two thirds into the game, in case you don't believe me about the whole 'stupid riddles for stupider babies' thing."
378120,Football Manager 2016,"nice game ... hoping to see some update , especially with transfers"
378260,Fortify,Starts well but controls clumsily for how frantic things can get later.
378270,Putrefaction,"This game is a joke. Save your time, and find other FPS games worth playing."
378300,The Knobbly Crook,"Beautiful art style, fantastic humour. Better than some of the paid point-and-clicks; I'd gladly for this one. I hope they continue to flesh out this world. It's character are very original and intriguing. I'm captivated already."
378370,Nomad, Early Access Review
378420,Jurassic Island: The Dinosaur Zoo, Early Access Review
378480,Badland Bandits, Early Access Review
378490,Sunny Hillride, https://youtu.be/J8CeOhTSr1Q   A light and colorful physics based infinite runner charges the player to drive through seemingly endless countryside never quite reaching their destination. Are they running from the past mistakes or simply searching for a cliff to throw themselves off?  The lack of diversity in the mechanics and level design drain the motivation to push through to later levels due to everything being the same as the first.
378510,"Witches, Heroes and Magic","If you don't want to read a lot, here's a resume : Don't, ever, buy this.  I mean... it's a decent RPG, with somewhat good physics and a bunch of good ideas. However... Well, let's just say that the first thing you'll try to find is how to rotate tour camera. And then, you'll find that it's impossible. And then, you'll wander into a sewer, where you don't see what's trying to kill you, because, eh, your camera isn't on the good side!  This game is unfinished at best, probably a homework for some studies. WHile it's not strictly unplayable, it really tries to be.  The lack of tutorial, the crappy time-dilatation system, the almost unmanageable units, the 'what does that spell do exactly?', the mostly incoherent story, ... everything tries to make you feel you wasted your money here."
378530,Nature's Zombie Apocalypse, Early Access Review
378570,Robo Miner,This game is by far one of the best miner games i've played would recommend
378580,Untamed: Life Of A Cougar,"Honestly this is so bad, it could have been a decent 3/5 game for memers but there is just so much wrong with this game. Why even have resolution options higher than 1080p when all the textures are just absolutely horrible. The sounds of this game would have just been so much better if it was just ambient noise or something instead someone thought it would be a good idea to have the same cougar sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥ your ears the whole game. The gameplay isn't very fun at all, the combat in this game is a complete and utter failure because why even strafe at all when the enemies just regenerate their health if you aren't constantly standing still and just attacking. The animation department is all just a mess, if you love seeing baby cougars just breaking every bone in their body while you're carrying them then maybe youll enjoy this games animations. There are little to none redeeming factors about this game. Cougars are my favorite animal but this game really didn't make a unique experience about cougars, if you literally just replaced the models with any other animal it would not change a thing. You could probably make make Untamed:Life of a wolf,buffalo,horse,johncena, by just changing nothing but the model. You're better off just donating $15 to Big Cat rescue or some ♥♥♥♥. IM pretty sure you'd have a better roleplaying experience just using your imagination tbh"
378590,Forest Warrior, Early Access Review
378610,Valley,"Well, id like to give this game a thumbs up. The review videos for it look great.  However, even though I dont have a controller for my PC, this game still thinks I do. It wont let me use my mouse or keyboard properly to navigate even the start menu. Its as if there is a 'right directional button' constantly held down causing the menu to forever loop through the options. This makes the game pretty much unplayable.  Disappointed."
378630,Shadows on the Vatican - Act II: Wrath,Can not reccomend. The game is extremely slow to load and crashed within 20 minutes. I don't get it. The graphics are all static single framed and there should be no burden on your graphics card or CPU based upon the minimum requirements. My system far exceeds in every aspect but It was painfully slow to load from one scene to the next.  Finally that black screen between scenes became permanent after about 20-25 minutes in. DONE. Got my refund.
378660,Blues and Bullets,"Good story, great style (reminds me of Max Payne in some ways, OK gameplay but for this style of game it is ery suited. I would definitely recommend this title."
378700,Neptune Flux,  Some quick gameplay  https://youtu.be/T3IWj0mTU7k 
378720,Thea: The Awakening,"Incredibly fun game, totally has me just wanting to take one more turn, play one more game.  The game has the 4X style hex based movement...however you're not building up new towns, you're more splitting up one set of people to stay back at your town while others go forth to gain material and kill off enemies for loot.  You have a gathering/crafting/building tree that you unlock through gaining research from building stuff.  It's a very nice balance between keeping your home safe, while adventuring forth to get new items to bring back to upgrade your town and your party to defeat stronger and stronger enemies.  And the voice acting is just so good.  Definitely a worthwhile game. Just shy of 100 hours, and I'm not seeing myself stopping any time soon."
378770,ESCHATOS,"Eschatos is probably my favorite shooter.  I've owned it for many years as an Xbox 360 import. This version seems like an excellent port.   The gameplay is fast and frantic, the soundtrack is catchy, and the simple textures still look great at high resolution. The game looks amazing in Tate(vertical monitor orientation). The game features working leaderboards and the ability to save replays, which is great for chasing high-scores.  The only downside to this steam version is that it lacks the enhanced Judgement Silver Sword games that were included on the Xbox disc. The publishers/developers seem to have decided to split these great games off into a seperate steam purchase(also an excellent port now that they've finally added leardboards that were initally missing).  If you like shooters/shmups support this game, it's great!"
378800,Police Tactics: Imperio,"I really wanted to like this game but unfortunately it's just not that fun. I can't really specify exactly where it goes wrong, it just feels pretty monotonous."
378810,Steamroll,"Overall this is an enjoyable puzzle game with an interesting steampunk theme. If you're a fan of physics based puzzle games then this is well worth a look, particuarly if you enjoy the steampunk theme.  The gameplay has an interesting mix of turret based 'pinball' shooting combined with a movement mechanic (I'd call it light platforming without jumping if that makes sense). While the sections focused on movement are not the most enjoyable parts of the games they are integrated into the puzzles in a manner that's more integrated into the puzzle than the simple 'clear a path to the exit' that you get in a lot of puzzle games.  My primary complaint with this is probably the length. I was able to complete the entire game (including achievements) in just 7 hours the first time through. I'm not opposed to short games in general but the problem with short puzzle games (including steamroll) is that a short game means that you don't really get a chance to build up a repetoire of tactics that you can use in future puzzles. That's particuarly noticeable here, each level feels completly different and for the most part strategys and tactics that work on one have very little impact on another.  Now saying 'each level feels different' does sound like an odd complaint but for a puzzle game I like it when later levels build upon skills and tactics that have been taught and used in earlier levels because it generally means that the puzzles have a greater level of depth to them. Steamroll doesn't really have that, each level and to some degree even each turret spot has a single, relatively unique solution to it that probably won't come up again.  Overall though this is still a solid game. The gameplay is fun, the plot is decent and the artwork is solid."
378830,The Princess' Heart,"Let me try to summarize this.... This game is not an rpg. It's more like the story of a selfish and self-centered princess who gives no ♥♥♥♥s about anyone else and just ♥♥♥♥s around with the prince of another country. The spells, though customizeable, literally require you to grind around 5+ levels to get the next one because you need points to learn them, points that you get at a rate of 1 per level. All the 'playable characters' are just a hindrance because you can only have 4 at a time fighting. Music is nice for what could have been a snes game, but nothing to brag about. there is also no open exploration of entire world as claimed. Deluxe version comes with extra skills and items? for a 15 hour game? not worth at all. they do a nice job at trying to sell their game with loaded words, but that's all it is. there are no equipments. All you get is a single weapon and a single accessory per character.   TL;DR this isn't really a game at all as much as it is a sort of anti-hero princess story that you can 'play' at least it only cost me $0.99"
378850,Galagan's Island: Reprymian Rising, Early Access Review
379210,Wayward, Early Access Review
379260,Atlantic Quest Solitaire,very short game disappointing
379290,Sumo Revise,"Fourteen billion years since the big bang, nearly five billion years since the creation of Earth and a good two hundred thousand years of humanity. Centuries of surviving, learning, creating art and everything that is the human expirience cannot justify the load of skunk ♥♥♥♥ that this game is. I'd rather be getting a train of phalluses from diseased pilgrims ran on me while sucking smallpox pus of a native americans ♥♥♥ sores. The physics of this game remind me of sucking paint thinner out of a garbage bag in a truckstop bathroom. I felt like I was never going to touch the ground and when I did I felt the satanic arms of hella and it's monostrosities grabbing at my feet,  because when you jump in this game you're stuck in the ♥♥♥♥ing air due to the floatinesss and when you land you move like a snail with polio   The  Sumo Wrestling  is basically two handicap chinamen playing rock paper scissors, the sprites ltierally have 2 frames. If this game were a person it'd be dragged into the street and beaten mercilessly."
379320,Clandestinity of Elsie,"The story was okay for me, didn't feel like anything overly special. The little cutscenes did keep me interested in where the story went, even if it was pretty predictable. Some of the areas were pretty tricky to get through, and you had great incentives to explore everything. Game has easy to grab achievements, which is always nice.   The combat was not my favorite. I definitely found it tricky to get used to. The gun only shooting once every 2-3 seconds added a little extra challenge. I will admit I had some trouble with certain sections. This was mostly due to the only light source being your flashlight, so enemies can surprise you. Then you have to shoot then run, shoot then run too. It's not a bad thing for most, but I wasn't a fan.   Grabbed it for only $0.50 so I'd say I got my money's worth. I don't think it's a bad game, just not something I would replay or recommend. If there was a neutral option for reviews, I would choose neutral."
379350,Sol Divide,"Great game except for one not-so-small problem. Console Classics couldn't even be bothered to implement Local Co-op, despite the fact that the original game supported it. While playing, you will still see the right side of the screen flashing Press Start for player 2. Sadly, you cannot. Until they address this ridiculous oversight, I cannot give this game a recommend. It's as simple as that."
379370,Mobile Light Force,"I think this would be fun if it were anything like playable. I'm forced to use the sucking ♥♥♥♥ing god damned mother ♥♥♥♥er analog stick, so I can't ♥♥♥♥ing god damned control the stupid god damned mother ♥♥♥♥ing character.  I'd really appreciate it if that weren't the case.  Moreover, I told the settings dialog to use 1080p but instead it used some lower resolution and shut off Aero, so my second monitor got all ♥♥♥♥ed up. I'm tired of constantly dealing with this ♥♥♥♥."
379380,ReLoaded,"Exactly what I saw, wanted and voted for, anyone down-voting this is a complete moron who is too ignorant to know what they're buying, before they buy it. The exact game I loved back in my childhood, now on Steam! what more can I ask for!  Also, people complaining about it being an emulated version, what else did you expect? Worth every single dollar!"
379390,Superstar Dance Club,"tl;dr this game is worth the dollar just so you can marvel at how horrible it is. I have no way to explain the positive reviews. If this game was your childhood, you were seriously starved for video games to play.  From my very first glance at the little cover image when this game popped onto my screen as a Steam gift, my impression of Superstar Dance Club was that it had to be a Dadaist statement, not an actual game. The ridiculous title and hideous art style suggested that the creator was either an utterly talentless 'indie developer' trying to be ironic, or a colorblind virgin with an art style primarily influenced by Astro Boy and Mew Mew Kissy Cutie Black.   To get this out of the way: the gameplay of Superstar Dance Club has two different sequences of buttons at the top of the screen, and the game tells you at the last second which sequence comes next. The two sequences do not change over the duration of the song, and buttons are always pressed rhythmically on the downbeat. So it's a really stupid and boring system, but don't get me wrong, Bust a Groove had an even stupider core mechanic and Bust a Groove was awesome. The difference is that Bust a Groove is full of personality and has great music. Thanks to the simple enjoyment of tactile interaction with catchy songs, rhythm games almost can't help but be entertaining for at least a little while.  As for Superstar Dance Club...  ... well.  The first song in Superstar Dance Club is one sickeningly cheerful measure of blaring synthesizer looped eight times. It's 30 seconds long, tops.  I was a little curious about the rest of the songs--surely some of them would mix it up with different instrument voices or something--but the sync is so far off (and/or the timing is so strict) that I was not equal to the challenge of pressing the X button four times to make the lazily drawn waifu on the screen cycle between her five frames of 'animation.' So I said screw it and uninstalled.  When I say that this game seems like a Dadaist statement, I mean that I could imagine someone creating this game as a way to sneer at people who think that the objective of game development is to create something that players enjoy. Superstar Dance Club is bad in a way that's much more than a lack of good qualities: what we have here is the Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff of rhythm games. It is a nega-game that finds creative ways to be unpleasant.  Go ahead and buy it, I guess. Perhaps you will gain something from the experience."

379520,DELTAZEAL,"Not a SHMUP player, so this is pretty challenging, but it's a lot of fun. Dig the weapon upgrade mechanics, because there are always these fun moments when you need to wind your way through a bunch of bullets to pick up the right upgrade, and it forces you to make a choice - endanger yourself in order to do more damage, or play it safe and live to fight another day."
379530,Fate Tectonics,"Fate Tectonics is a real-time tile-based world-building game where the big twist comes from the watchful eye of a pantheon of gods called 'Fates.' Each one has their own personality, preferences, and opinions on how you should build the world. If you continue to ignore a given Fate's preferences, they'll steadily grow angrier until they unleash natural disasters onto your world, potentially undoing all of your creations. On top of this, you must also manage a special Fate who periodically triggers a doomsday event, destroying your entire world and starting you back from square one. You're graded after each doomsday and given additional time to work on your next world based on certain accomplishments / achievments, until you gather up enough time to unlock all of the Fates and 'complete' your world before doomsday arrives. The whole game is exceptionally charming and has a lot of personaity layered on top of some simple but enjoyable mechanics. It can be a little stressful jumping in, as the Fates require a lot of juggling, but it's overall a very silly and exciting experience that I am happy to recommend."

379640,Bloo Kid 2,Very fun to play 2d platformer game. I'm still playing and haven't completed the game yet. This game at first started out seeming like it would be really easy to play and continualy gets harder as you go along as it should. I especially like the double jump feature of this game.
379670,Technolust,This game is Awesome and should only be played in Vr if you want to get the best experience from it. If your under the age of 20 you probably wont get most of the pop culture references. grab a drink or a bowl and enjoy
379720,DOOM,"Singleplayer: + Rewarding gameplay + Challenging but not too frustrating + Plenty of secrets to find + Focused storyline - Can become repetitive (arena, find a key, next arena, rinse and repeat) - Rather short  Multiplayer: + They are at least trying - Confusing layout - Too COD-ish - Very limited text chat General: + Atmosphere is spectacularly DOOM + Graphics are amazing, but can still run on modest machines + General badassery  I bought this game for $20 on the sale, and that is in honesty what it is worth. The singleplayer is fantastic, even if a bit short for my taste, and there is some replay value with the arcade. Don't expect anything from the multiplayer though. If you're someone who loves doom, you will enjoy the campaign. If you're looking for a great multiplayer experience, here is not the place to find it. The reason I'm giving the game a recommendation is simply because the campaign is too much fun to give it a negative rating."
379760,Gravity Error,"I want to start of just saying this: I'm really bad at plat formers.   And I would like to point out that I 100% this game, it's just a tad too easy, I was struggling more on the 4th planet than the 5th. Would i recommend this game? Full price, no. On sale, yes.  This game would be amazing on mobile, and I would 100% it again if it was on mobile (unless I'm being stupid and it's already on mobile)"
379870,Alteil: Horizons,"Tried to play this game several months ago and had issues with the client. Tried again today and it looks like nothing has changed, the client is unusable, half the time it never loads and the other half of the time it crashes as soon as I try and do anything. The game might be fun to play, but no one on steam has any idea, please fix."
379960,Mahjong Pretty Girls Battle : School Girls Edition,"Have you ever played a game, having no clue what’s going on while everyone else laughs at you for it? That is how I felt while playing this game.  This game is not beginner friendly at all. If you do not know how to play mahjong, then do not even consider buying this game. The game does not provide any tutorials on how to play the game. It doesn’t even tell you what the goal of the game is, you are just expected to know it.  I cannot judge the game any further than this because I do not know how mahjong works. I expected the game to teach me since it was in English, but instead, I wasted my money."
379980,Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator,"I wish I could recommend this, it's pretty funny, with some seriously dark humour in places, and while it lasts it's fun.  It's criminally short through, with about 5-6 decicisions to make and a massively railroaded, rushed ending that makes zero sense. Can wrap it up in under an hour with practically no replay value."
379990,Hush,"What can I say, after going through an endless corridor we arrive at a basement. What goes after that? Two room, and the rest... I really don't know, because for the dozen times I tried to eventually kill all the possessed barrels and briefcases and keep playing the game I failed. The controls are plain bad.. although updated they seem kinda stiff.  Although we swipe 'GoGo', the monsters are only hit on a specific position, and there's no feedback when we hit a monster, why not adding a crash sound? Why the monsters are so hard to kill?  The combat, well, spinning around monsters trying to dodge them and at the same attack them is pretty boring and difficult.  Did not like."

3800,Advent Rising,"There aren't a whole lot of space operas and luckily this is a good one. Along with the scifi aspect it does a pretty good job of making you feel super human. It's not quite as fleshed out as say Infamous or Prey when it comes to that but the pace is far quicker which increases how potent the abilities feel.  All of the powers, guns, and unarmed attacks start a little underwhelming but as they are leveled up their impact is very satisfactory.  Pros: Quick gameplay. Aged relatively well.  Major power trip. Great space opera story.  Cons: Weird, but not difficult controls. Story could use a sequel pretty badly to finish it."

But its not a good game either. the controls are stiff, aiming is bad and game is a bit boring.

380100,Flute Master,"Music Teacher, here. Completed the game in 65 minutes (completely hammered, no less). This will be fantastic for my kids. The kind of thing I will geek out about and they will get excited over. On sale at 5.99, good deal. Watch out for the fingering given for 'low f' (f on the staff), as a lot of recorders (Baroque/English) use a different one for tuning purposes. This game was made for the German soprano recorder, which is a bit out of style- the fingerings are easier for beginners with the German, but it's harder to stay in tune. Just keep that in mind, and the game will be amazing!"
380120,Celia's Quest,"The best part of Celia's Quest is it's comedy. The game world is as strange and weird as the characters who live in it, and at time it reminded my of Terry Pratchett's Discworld.This game is funny and kind of crazy. You can expect puns and jokes around every corner and while the graphics are not exactly pretty, they do work surprisingly well with this kind of comedic setting.  It's basically a interactive comedy (with some difficult RPG combat mixed in). So if that's something you think you'll enjoy I would like to stop here and recommend this game to you right away.   However if you're still not sure let me elaborate a little more. Celia's Quest is an adventure game with an RPG styled combat system. And while the combat system is fairly deep, allowing you to customize your build by choosing skills and allocating stat points to fit your own play style, there are some distinct differences from a typical RPG.   First being that you don't level up, instead you need to find and use power ups. Many of them are well hidden and rewarded to you for completing an optional puzzle or dungeon which means that if you miss or ignore them you'll most likely struggle with the combat. Though, if an area is too difficult you can always go search for more secrets elsewhere and come back again when you've powered up your stats. Also, since enemies are visable on the map you can sometimes outrun them if need be.  Second thing is that equipment and items does not just simply make you stronger (some do), but are instead mostly balanced around being useful in certain situations or in certain locations. Since you can only borrow one equipment of a specific type at any time this means you might have to go back to town to switch them out occasionally.  Also worth noting is that there is no gold for you to spend in shops either. You'll level up merchants supply by trading them precious craft kits to expand their supply of 'borrow-able items'. It's also possible to gamble (to get a random buff or healing item) by spending monster tears that you'll get for clearing an encounter - but that's it.  Do keep in mind that items and opportunities to get them are (kind of) limited since once an area is cleared of enemies they don't come back!  I'll end this review with a list of PRO's and CON's to help you decide.  + Funny story, characters, dialogue etc + Challenging combat (if that's your cup of tea) + Good exploration with many hidden secrets (feels inspired by the Zelda series) + Interesting and challenging puzzles (if that's your cup of tea) + New Game+ feature with additional content   - The graphics are not pretty (enemy sprites look fine) - Some of the maps are too cluttered and passages are narrow making them hard to navigate. - Challenging combat (if that's NOT your cup of tea) - A lot of running back and forth to town to get healed up (especially in the beginning) - In game skill descriptions are not enough to plan a build (READ THE MANUAL!)

380670,Final Approach,"I paid almost 30$ for it, never worked well and now it's 9$. ♥♥♥♥ me."
380690,Don'Yoku,"This game is really, really fun. There are still a few small issues that need to be worked out (mainly relating to the ability to use the analog stick on 360 pads) -- but the developers have been VERY *prompt* AND *active* in the community, responding to bug reports and having patches out within days at most. And, they've assured us that the next patch will address ALL of our control issues!  The game itself is a pixel-art, tate, Japanese style shoot-em-up -- and it really has a lot of character and style. The ONLY negative at all at present is the control issues, but I've found that using my arcade stick (and JoyToKey) has proved to be a working temporary fix.  I really expect to see this one veer into 'Positive' soon -- especially once the control fixes are patched! All in all, I've found it to be a very fun, original, and aesthetically pleasing shoot-'em-up!"
38070,Coconut Queen,"Coconut Queen features the brawniest of gents. Sure, it's a well made simulation that requires decent planning and skill, and it is fun and challenging from start to finish complete with extra areas. But that's all just icing on the cake that is the brawny gents. Worthy title, a shame the sequel never happened, eleven out of five coconuts."
380700,Zombie Killtime,"Yeaaaaa, no thanks. It's a cute game, and it was fun for about 3 minutes, but without an online community its hard to really give this a fair review. By itself, it's not worth it. I got it as part of a bunderstars bundle, and I'm glad that I didn't pay full price.   Not a bad game, but there are others worth spending your money on."
380750,Anima Gate of Memories,Im not too deep into the game but Ive played the tabletops for years and love the universe. This game has many puzzles mixed with combat to dig into the lore of Gaia.
380770,Wind of Luck: Arena,"This game is closed. Do not bother downloading it because you won't be able to play it.   This is the official statement from developers:    'Dear fellow captains!   With greatest sorries we have to inform you that the game servers and the game website will be closed from 1 March 2016.   This is the very difficult and reluctant decision, but we had to face the fact that we can't further develop and improve the project becasue C4 game engine, that we are using, no longer supported by the developer. Many of the technical problems associated with it.   Currently we plan to migrate the game to other game engine. This will require much more resources and we can't support the current project and work on the migration simultaneously. Now we are looking for new partners and investors to help us to make a new version by the end of this year.   We thank everyone who was with us and played Wind of Luck: Arena.   Trazzy Team.'"

3810,BloodRayne,"  I do not recommend this game, if you are playing on a new OS due to tons of crashing, or with a Xbox 360 controller on the computer due to bad controls.   A classic hack and slash game that led to 2 game sequels, some comics, and 2 movies (Don't watch the movies). This game is not for everyone, it's pretty much a cult game. If you enjoy hack and slash and slaying vampires, this game just might be up your alley.  Play as Rayne, a vampire hybrid, as she seeks vengeance against her father."
38100,Build-A-Lot 3,It is an interesting and challenging game... Can't explain it really... I recommend all the Build-A-Lot series! I have played only 2 and 3 but I know 'cause I have seen how Build-A-Lot 4 and Build-A-Lot 1 are. They are as awesome as the others. So I recommend buyng the whole bundle.
381010,Orion: A Sci-Fi Visual Novel,"Review in 100 words or less, go:  The plot of this game is a young boy who learns he has time travel capability and is quickly wrapped up in a government scheme. It's not easy to tell who the good and bad guys are. The plot choices are extremely bland and trope. Unfortunately the story is poorly told which means there is no real intensive to replay the game for all the endings. The 1st ending I found was unsatisfying and confusing. The other endings were not any better. It's a shame as the graphics and sound in the game are above average for a visual novel."

381100,The Men of Yoshiwara: Kikuya,"VERY boring. Dogenzaka Lab basically makes the same game every time, just with different characters, and I'm starting to regret purchasing their entire bundle without testing one of their games first. The stories are boring, the choices are basically pointless as it's generally quite easy to determine what the 'good' choice is supposed to be, and you either get a good ending or a bad one, there are no variations in plot. Maybe it's a 'lost in translation / cultural' sort of thing, I don't know, but I have no interest in a protagonist who faints after being kissed and who blushes / stammers / says 'ungh' (???) every two seconds."
381120,Shoppe Keep,"If you're working in retail this game can help you relax from the stress, because it's much simpler and the best thing is you can flip off customers without any consequences."

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Like many others, I love this game. There's not many other games that can effectively scratch the need to play hide-and-seek like this game does. There's so many things it gets right, and if you're a fan of horror movies like I am, you'll be thrilled at the little moments the game gets right: being chased by an unstoppable killer, desperate for some help or relief (or being the one doing the chasing).  Obviously, this would be a huge, stonking thumbs up if everything else bar the gameplay was in place- which it just isn't.  The matchmaking and lobby system for DBD is absolutely horrendous, and will be the true thing you'll be struggling with constantly, rather than a killer. You'll get into lobbies, only to be unceremoniously kicked or crashed to your desktop. You'll connect into a game and the killer will instantly drop. Sometimes the game won't give you the pleasure of letting you know a queue's failed for some random reason and you'll just be sitting there with your mates twiddling your thumbs in the lobby.  Long loading times abound, endless loading screens as well. This is a well-reported issue to the DBD devs, judging by older reviews from Early Access, and remains unfixed.  It pains me to say don't buy this, but it's the only fair response. Until the networking issues are fixed, this is a flawed gem, with all the caveats that come with it. Keep it on your wishlist, check the discussion forums/Reddit or whatever takes your fancy, and pick it up when it's fixed- if that ever happens.  Alternatively, the Friday 13th game is on the way, and if that isn't a buggy mess on launch it's likely going to kick DBD into the dust, so I'll see you there."
381220,Hydraulic Empire,"This is not a bad game, there are some substance and challenge, but it is a bit rough around the edges for a commercial game, and I think there are a number of better and more polished games in the crowded Tower Defense genre.  The game production is quite ambitious and certainly above many mobile TD ports. but unfortunately it lacks polish in several areas. In particular when there are many enemies on screen the action become confuse and it is sometimes hard to place a tower where you want because there are always an enemy on the tile were you want to built hence the game display an enemy info box instead of the build pop-up just because you can't access the empty tile with your mouse pointer. Here a simple keyboard shorcut for building would have helped.  Then there are occasional fram rate drops or even a few of CTDs (though not during action proper but rather when navigating through menu).  Also annoying is the fact that the game doesn't properly save your highscore and on occasion I also had my progress reset to zero.  The campaign map is not very convenient, either to navigate or to inform you on the exact map #ID and your progress so far, here many TDs do a much better job.  Also the game lack a proper manual and a Towers and Ennemies cyclopedia.  Besides these annoying issues, there is some challenges so it might be worthwhile on sale. Though I would recommend other TDs over this one"
381260,Orion Trail,"Essentially a cross between 'The Oregon Trail', 'FTL', and a dice and card game, Orion Trail is a fun, easy to play game of making decisions. Parody of existing science fiction tropes and series is constant, making the game a more light-hearted tale of survival - or horrible death - in space. Orion Trail plays as a series of decisions, the outcome of which is determined by what amounts to the roll of electric dice the odds of which are affected by the stats of crew, ship, and circumstance.   The decisions the player makes affect the stats that the random component works upon, and results in turn affect not only those same stats, but the resources that define the mission as a whole: crew, food, fuel, bravado, and science. The goal of any game is to survive a trip through a region of the universe. Each path has many alternate routes within it, each possessed of differing levels of danger and problems to solve. The game is different every time, making each adventure unique.  Orion Trail could best be described as a digital board game, though it does draw on early edutainment software for inspiration as well. The entire process of gameplay is decision based - there is no 'action' as such beyond player choice. Although humorous, the choices can have serious consequences. Survival is not guaranteed. The first galaxy is relatively tame, later missions become quite challenging indeed.  It is clear a lot of love went into Orion Trail, and the developers add more content to it from time to time as well."
38130,Farm Frenzy 2,"I hate being timed for all of the tasks I perform. If you like the challenge of beating scores and levels, this game is for you. I personally was just seeking something a lot more casual and laid back."
381320,Bezier,"I'm a lover of all things neon and twin-stick, but this game gets it completely wrong. The presentation is a mess with so much conflicting information and ugly noise you'll never see what hits you. Maybe it's fun once you're fully upgraded, and that is the definition of broken design. Skip it. Spend your money on some burgers."

38150,Farm Frenzy 3,"Out of all the Farm Frenzy games, Farm Frenzy 3 is the one to get. It is, by far, the most comprehensive Farm Frenzy games of the series.  The third iteration of the series still harkens to the classic 'Farm Frenzy' formula where you have to manage your farm's production through varying levels of increasing difficulty as your operation becomes more and more complicated. It's a mini-game fueled 'farm tycoon' game with none of the meta-game, and Popcap-style arcade play.  Farm Frenzy 3 trasnports us to various locations around the globe, managing different farms in different regions. Each location is slightly different, but the mechanics remain the same. There is a light narrative going on top of the game where your character, Scarlett is the girl in charge.  I was a little disappointed that Scarlett represents a white colonialist business model, engaging in questionably clandestine practices in economically less-developed regions, but this game is for 6 year olds."

38160,Farm Frenzy 3 American Pie,"Farm Frenzy is back! And this time, with none of the colonialist trappings of the previous instalments. No longer is the GREAT WHITE helping out the disenfranchised minorities; she's helping herself.  The aptly named 'American Pie' version of Farm Frenzy 3 mimics the success of the earlier games, never straying too far from the tried-and-true formula of growing your farm empire through the application of a li'l ol' fashioned sweat!  If you liked the other Farm Frenzy games, it's obvious that you would probably like this game too, though there isn't a lot of innovation driving this series forward. However, if you were saddled with crippling white guilt for your enjoyment of the decidedly marginalizing and borderline racist past games, you'll be able to enjoy this game nearly guilt free since it plays a little closer to heart &amp; home of the character.  Granted, that doesn't take into account the intensive farming policies that this game encourages...environmentalists BEWARE!"
381610,Dandy: Or a Brief Glimpse into the Life of the Candy Alchemist,"This is a fun shoot em up type of game that can also be quite frustrating because after working really hard learning the patterns of the enemies you get to a different bit and then you get shot in the face and die! and have to go all a back to the beginning again to start again.  But, if this is the type of game for you then it can be quite good fun especially if you need to waste a few minutes while waiting to something else the load, you can have a few goes on this to see how far you get.   gameplay example.   https://youtu.be/eZ_bMQyKaHc "

381800,DRIFT 84, Early Access Review
381850,My Paper Boat,A hidden game gem; thats all one can really say about this relaxing and sometimes annoying (in a good puzzely way).  There is alot of hidden areas to explore and there is always an achivement to strife for (example; collect all coins in a level).  Gameplay wise this is a really good hidden gem.  Id even say it is worth the full price of 5 Euros. (not something I most often feel is the case with other games)
381870,Koala Kids,"A nice platformer thats good for relaxing or killing time, just like how the world is killing our planet with pollution. Did you know: the United States has the highest incarceration rate. The United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth. Yet, somehow, none of them are the Wall Street bankers whose illegal activities caused the global economic collapse and destroyed the lives of millions of Americans. The huge Wall Street banks are ‘too big to fail.’ The leading bankers are ‘too big to jail.  4/5 - The koalas working on the home screen are hard-working citizens with families, yet they live on a starving wage."
381880,Red Rope: Don't Fall Behind,"Interesting concept until your realize how utterly tedious playing a game tethered to someone else is. Being tethered to someone else is limiting and the limitations don't make the gameplay interesting. This is combined with an instant death mechanic that punishes you for any mistake.  Combine that with vague artsy fartsy pixelart ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that leaves you with little direction and you have a recipe for a refund. Pixelart style is overdone and lame. And in this case, it makes things harder to judge. Which is annoying since of mentioned instant death.  And you know what? Don't accuse me of ragequitting your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little game just because I happen to close with alt+F4. The only thing that made me rage was your little accusation. You're not being clever, you're just being a ♥♥♥♥. Ragequitting? No, boredquitting. And then ragereviewing because you wasted my time and money and then insulted me on the way out the door."
38190,Romance of Rome,"Hidden object game where the objects are actually hard to find, although a hint is almost always available if the stress of hunting for those hidden objects is too much for you to bare. The backgrounds are re-used fairly often, which is cheap. There's also this weird between-levels activity where you dress up some flamboyant young man in all sorts of tacky jewelry. It's not terrible if you like the genre (which I don't), but it's hardly a travesty, either. 2 out of 5 stars kinda thing."
381900,Bard's Gold,"This is a very well thought out platformer. I can't think about any cons. It's a bit hard, but you'll get the hang of it. Great style and music as well.  8.5/10"
381910,Xenocide,"Fun alien game but lacks multiplayer. Could be made more complex with more weapons or upgrades, Great way to burn an hour or so as it is a great (co-op) party game. So from a F2P perspective it is fitting but unfortunately most the achievements require P2P elements of more time. But I managed to get some achievements and almost got on the highscores so can't knock it, thumbs up!"
381940,Trials on Tatooine,"I was ♥♥♥♥ing R. A. P. E. D... in these 'trials' . You know what the most 'trial' part about this was? Leaving. I got to leave the emotional and physical turmoil of being ♥♥♥♥♥ behind. Oh wait, NO I DIDN'T. I'm permanentally emotionally scarred from this ♥♥♥♥ing hell hole of a 'trial'. I contemplate every day whether I should go on living or kill myself because of the distress I feel on a day-to-day basis because of this ♥♥♥♥ING 'GAME'. I'M ♥♥♥♥ING DONE."
381990,Dragon Saga,"A great game with an economy that would require some more love seeing how the gold-to-premium-currency rate went up quite a few times up to absurd levels, and some balance changes seeing how a few classes are still way more powerful than the others.  Highly recommended nonetheless (I wouldn't have played over 1,000 hours on my former account had I not enjoyed it) as long as you never visit the forum and have no care in the world for a management team whose members (in particular : a developer who also is a forum mod and a game master) openly insult users, applies terrible sanctions to players who are simply trying to do things right (warning about a real danger is a ban-worthy offence around there), took 6 whole months to get rid of the most toxic abuser of all times because they were putting 1,000+ USD a week into the premium shop, completely disregards the advice of older (and usually wiser) players outside of their occasional poll for this or that tiny change, banned several players that reported game-breaking exploits, and are  of course  always right in everything they do, however many sensible arguments you may have.  If you want to play, just ignore the staff completely and take things as they come. It never got quite old, and customization is a freaking wonderful thing, with tons of different outfits."

382050,Eon Altar, Early Access Review
382090,Dungeon Nightmares II : The Memory,"I was in love with the first Dungeon Nightmare, so I decided to buy the sequel. While I think it's a great horror game, with a great potential (based almost entirely on the creepy and dark atmosphere), I'm also very disappointed for something happened while playing (some minor spoilers ahead).   Basically, on the 4th floor, I was simply walking through the corridors and, from nowhere, something attacked me from behind. I was walking foward and there was nothing in my sight (I also had my candle lit). So, after 1.30h of play, I have been killed by something that I didn't even notice (and, no, the timer was still around 5 minutes). Then, the game put me in front of two doors: 'choose: one will let you continue, the other one will be your end'. Guess what? I choose the wrong one and now I have to play EVERYTHING again from the very beginning. So I have been killed by something without the possibility to escape and then got ****ed by some random 'flip a coin' choice.   What a dumb way to destroy the mood for a great horror game. Now I'm simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. I know that this game is randomly generated but I can't get over the frustration of playing it again for such a stupid thing.  What's the point into this kind of mechanic, besides creating the 'oh, I'm really happy now, I must do it again and wasn't even my fault, I'm going to enjoy it so much and to be so much scared for something I already saw...'.   Next time, please, allow some kind of 'checkpoint' system or, at least, don't punish people for something they couldn't even notice.  EDIT: I restarted the game right now and, as soon as I enter the first dungeon, I get a silent black screen and the game freezes without a reason. This doesn't help at all XD"
38210,Roogoo,this is the best game ever  i have never experienced true bliss until i played this magnificent piece of art i love this game so much omg .
382110,Virtual Desktop,Best player for VRPorn!.. ermmm. I meant... best player for watching home movies!
382120,Journey To The Center Of The Earth,THATS MY GAME :)
382130,Exile's End,good ol' snes frustration. love it.
382140,SKYHILL,"This game fun for a little bit. I think it's the perfect phone app, if you wanted to buy it there instead of on steam, it's a great way to pass time. It's not exactly complete enough for a computer game, but it's enjoyable still."
382160,Dark Years,why couldn't they just make it a regular point and click adventure and hire some decent voice actors?
382180,Devilry,This game is one hot bag of complete and utter failure.
382250,Lightrise,"Can't recommend this title, Why? well for one it took me longer to get it to run and not crash with a exe error. Then when I do get into the game and go to lobby there is Nobody on it.. Really nothing exciting to do by yourself except get bored and jump off the cliff and exit the game. Will adjust my review when this game is worked on more and there is actually players."
382260,8Bit Fiesta,Absolute fun. Anyone with friends or SO should buy this. Paid full price. 10/10 would recommend.
382270,Space Xonix,"This game entertained me for the first 5 miniutes, however, at the price of the game, it wasn't really worth the cost and is trumped by F2P games I have played online. Do NOT buy this game if you want value for money."
38230,Hotel Giant 2,"Does not work on windows vista anymore since the latest update. Did a verify integrity, deleted the entire game and reinstalled, same thing. It really wasn't that great of a game even when it did work years ago. Don't waste your time."
382300,Kidnapped,Story line was hard to follow at first. A few good frights. Forest level and church put my low-end video card through the paces. Overall 3 out of 5
382320,Heart of Ember  ,Such a trash game makes me want to wish they had refund in ap
382350,Devil's Bluff,"A multiplayer game should be playable offline, to protect it from 'Online players: 1' who is only you. Therefore it's unplayable. Also, the practice mode doesn't really tell what game is it. Whole size of the map makes the game look like a chaos."
382380,The Amber Throne,"I played mostly offline so it wasnt recorded but i finished the game in around 17 hours.   Hands down the best (and by far the most beautiful) rpg maker engine game ive ever played.  If you enjoyed games like final fantasy IV,V and VI or the Golden sun series you will probably love this one too.   PROS:  -Charming story and characters, the whole game has a bittersweet tone, wich fits the themes in the story perfectly.  -Beautifully painted parallax backgrounds instead of the outdated tileset system most rpg maker games use. -Animated Battlers in a way reminiscent of the golden sun games, there is some depth to the combat system aswell, with enemies varying their defenses and attacks during the battles.  -Crafting system.  -Excellent OST  CONS:   -the game resolution is locked at 640x480, but since this is a technical limitation from the engine, there is little the devs could have done without breaking the TOS of the software.  -Very little optional content, aside from a secret super boss and some stuff here and there.  -The game is not very difficult, but it never gets so easy that combat becomes trivial either (unless you really grind for it)   In conclusion, this is little hidden gem that every jrpg lover should play, it will remind you when japanese rpgs had interesting worlds to explore, with stories filled with dauting themes and a varied cast of characters instead of waifus and pretty boys with impossible haircuts.  "
382420,E.T. Armies,Pros that uninspired voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. cons  the multiplayer maps are bad (as in there not very finished)  servers are always empty with no one on at alll another abandon indie game  *note for an Indie studio this is actually a pretty good effort
382480,Super Dungeon Run, Early Access Review
382490,Relic Hunters Zero: Remix,"To be honest overall it's a meh game. It's like a cheap, less fun version of Nuclear Throne. Honestly it's waayyy too  SLOW Pacing is slow, (finding the treasures takes a long time) battling is long, AND THE CHARACTERS MOVE SO SLOW! Even with sprint. Honestly with this game, I'm on the fence; but I'm siding more on the negative. Solid 4.5/10"
382880,Feudalism,  Really good Strategic Game
382920,RETSNOM,"It’s the digital manifestation of pretentiousness: a theoretically enticing convergence of deep gameplay and metaphorical storytelling, all of which utterly fails to connect on any level.  Full review:  http://www.darkstation.com/reviews/retsnom/ "
3830,Psychonauts,"'My Name-' -Raz 'STARTS WITH A D!' -Oleander '-Is Razputin.' -Raz 'Hmmpph.' -Oleander  Probably my favorite platformer of all time. Writers have a great sense of humor and the characters are some of the most intruiging I've seen in a while, and this was made in 2005.  Playtime: 10-18 hours (depending on if you collect all the collectibles and such)  Gameplay: Great Parkouring system and the Psychic abilities really add to the fun  Humor: Great, and bounding to make you at least smile  Difficulty: Mostly ok until end where if you don't know what you're doing it can be a bit hard."

DIDN'T EVEN CRASH AT PART 7 THOSE IDIOTS ARE LYING TO GET THE GAME DEAD OR FREE, do not listen to them if you have the right stuff you'll be able to play, if anything does not work send me a broadcast i'll help ya out because in 2 days i've already beaten the campain"
383190,SUMICO - The Numbers Game,Fun little puzzle game. Easy to get into but with a lot of depth. Can't recommend at full price but under a couple bucks or in a bundle like I got it it's definitely a winner.
383230,Dungeon Souls,great game fantastic design but 2 major problems of this game are that the resolution doesnt matter and black bars will appear on the sid of your screen no matter what and that the game runs 60 but at times may require many restarts because the game sets at 45 instead of 60
383240,Angels That Kill - The Final Cut,"DISCLAIMER: Review was written PRE-1.1, judging by the update list I am considering giving the game another shot. I have a lot of respect for developers who listen to feedback and will be considering replaying this game.   This will be a summary of all the major points in my full review (linked below):  Story: The story seems fairly decent but the limited dialouges and frustrating gameplay elements make it difficult to desire more.  Gameplay: Easily the most frustrating part of the game. Unfortunately the game revolves around walking around a big, empty, boring city with absolutely no navigations. I found it extremeley frustrating and essentially took away all fun the game had.  Sound: I liked the music, sound effects were lacking however.  Design: I see a style I really like here, however with a simplistic design (little color, simple models, and no textures or lighting) you'd think the game would make up for it in other elements, it doesn't. Unfortunately the design feels extremely lazy.  Read my full review or watch my playthrough here:  http://www.keengamer.com/article/12231_angels-that-kill-review "
383270,Hue,Good puzzle game  Gets harder towards the end
383330,Star Chronicles: Delta Quadrant,"Step 1 Get thrusters. Step 2 Swap weapons for thrusters Step 3 Use thrusters Step 4 Zoom pass enemy Step 5 Exit through portal Repeat -Reached halfway or more before getting blown up, but interesting run. Probably can build up a destoryer. However, if you're patient to take the time to play the game as finding better gear is based on luck and levelling up the skills means grinding the game. Sadly there is no upgrade for more slots, or bigger ships... not that I know of. It was okay, but after awhile, it's just the same old thing, just curiosity of what happens at the end."
383460,Sound of Drop - fall into poison -,"Solid and gripping plot, with just enough mystery left unsolved to draw you in. Have been playing this game for a few weeks, and it's really good aside from a few immersion breaking grammar and spelling errors. Beautiful graphics in many scenes, and terrifying scenarios."
383520,Lilly and Sasha: Guardian Angels,This game I understand in a series. I go tthis game for free when I bought a bundle pack of random games. THIS GAME COSTS TO MUCH Congrats you made a game with rpg maker then you go and sell it for 8.99?!??!?! Storyline is intresting but I could care less.  3/10 - Dont buy unless you like reading more than playing games 
383530,Vortex,"This game has a huge learning curve, one that you most-likely won't ever get over. The control scheme is meant to be a bit disorienting to make the game much more difficult, whilst easily playable, for the player. Don't lead this disuade you though, this game is incredibly unique, and a brilliant concept.   The premise of the game is that you must shoot powerups at the colored circles located in the middle of your quadrant. Once you shoot one with a powerup, the powerup will move to the quadrant corresponding with the color of the circle that you had shot. You may not regularly shoot at other players, as you must use the portals in the middle of your area. Other players also have the ability to halt your powerups, for example... one powerup spawns some enemies within the area that you should it to. The player in that area may shoot and kill the enemies of course, so that they will not remain taunting the other player for the remainder of the game. As I stated previously, and you most likely could already tell... I would highly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys local, splitscreen party-like games."
383540,Metro Warp,"if you like game that dont have any tutorials and require you to go online and look up guides just to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ you are supposed to do or how, then this is the game for you. lets support more developers who are too ♥♥♥♥ing lazy to put even basic instructions or gameplay concepts into their games!!!!!!!!!"
383560,Squarelands,"This game gets boring in like 5 min. If you want a not-boring game, GET TERRARIA!"
383580,Flesh Eaters, Early Access Review
383590,Expert Rifleman - Reloaded,"I've never been a shooter (or wanted to be, with a real rifle) but I enjoy games that offer shooting as a sniper. Thus, I expected something significant from 'Expert Rifleman - Reloaded'. It claims to be the first of its kind for the consumer market, yet offers ZERO instructions or information, but TONS of options to be selected. This should be a plus, but what they mean is largely anyone's guess.   I'm having so much trouble that I've yet to find a target to shoot at, though I'm tried every mode. The movement is horrible, the wind effect in the trees is 20 years out of date. The effect of a bullet hitting is even worse. There is very little good about this game, and this will be my first refund in nearly 600 games (other than 'Journey of the Light'.)  Consider what is at the bottom of each screen 'EXC to exit'. Read it again, please."
383620,Flight Unlimited Las Vegas,Unplayable. Terrible game. I tried using a joystick and crashed before even getting off the ground!! I've spent $2.99 on better things like crappy coffee.
383630,SEEP Universe,"This game is really impressive - if it's 1985. But it's 2016. This is a poorly implemented, clunky 2D retro super mario ripoff, without the same level of endearing gameplay.  The Engrish is strong: 'This game support the xinput controller' is the first thing the developers smack you in the face with. Telling you that it's not really aimed at the English market, and it's not aimed at the PC gaming market. Who's it for then? Confused Italians, is my best guess.  Graphics are terrible (it's been a long time since the NES came out - 30 years, in fact). So when your highest technological achievement is something that was surpassed 30 years ago, some introspection is badly needed.   Gameplay is weak - the only positive is the addition of co-op gaming on a single system (because apparently it's 1985 and networking protocols haven't been invented yet). It's a super mario ripoff with a push mechanic instead of a jump on head mechanic.   No reason to buy this. Better examples of this dead genre are out there, if you're that way inclined."
383670,That Old Time Religion,"The story is too short with no substantial gameplay. If you're expecting a virtual novel which you can get into and play for hours as a complex story unravels, this is not what you're looking for. It's quite cheap, but somehow still manages to deliver below its value. The mechanics are simple, and although I don't get too hung up on that in a visual novel, the story hardly compensates for it. Overall, it feels like one of those toys you get out of Kinder Surprise eggs, you know? Very underwhelming."
383690,Mu Complex,"Good command-line based gameplay. The learning curve for the puzzles is fairly reasonable for the intended audience for these kinds of games. I played this as a flash game for free before and it introduced me to command-line based games. I bought this because I wanted to support the developers and personally found    The Resistance message after you get the inverted Konami code-style secret code intriguing.     Overall a reasonably enjoyable experience for its price.  Get this game if:  -you like solving interesting puzzles -you enjoy figuring out a story for yourself, instead of it simply being spoonfed to you -you like command-line based gameplay (or typing games in general) -you previously enjoyed the free version of it and want to help support the developers make future games"
383700,Boneless Zombie,"Boneless Zombie has potential, but it fails to reach it (no pun intended - you'll understand if you've played the game).  The cartoon graphics are quite nice, and the basic idea is fine, but the game is let down by its other elements.  If you play the game for a few minutes, it is fine, but as you start to level up, it just becomes annoying, due to the key mapping. I found the controls to be terrible, especially the use of I and P as main keys; I think that it would have been better if it was designed with the two keys chosen to have been right beside each other. In any event, that problem could have been overcome if the game allowed players to change the key configuration, but it doesn't - so it fails miserably on that score.  As a minor point, the Help screen informs players that Esc is the self-destruct key, but it actually is the Space key that is used for self-destruction. As it is one of the few controls for the game, it was a bit slipshod to have got it wrong on the Help screen. Luckily, one of the tips you receive when you first play the game tells you that you can use the Space key for self-destruct, but if you miss that or gloss over it, then the Help screen will be of no use (I only discovered it because the tip appears in a screenshot that I took).  If the controls for this game were improved, or - better yet - if players could change the configuration of the keys used, then that could make all the difference. But, as it stands, I could not recommend this game.  It's fun for a short while, but overall it's a thumbs down for this game."
383710,Princess KAGUYA,Just to fit my collection. Nice first level badge.
383720,Swords & Crossbones: An Epic Pirate Story,The worst game ever!
383730,RPG Maker 2000,I would buy this again if I was stupid (26/7&gt;&gt;hhj$h(&gt;^€]€€\*\€ 10/10
383750,Funk of Titans,"I did come very close to giving this game a thumbs down, if only on the basis that the storefront (in fact, all the storefronts, also on Android, Xbox, PS4) is deliberately misleading about what Funk of Titans actually is. The short and narrow of the issue: if you're looking for a traditional 2.5D platformer that lets you explore levels, this isn't it. Funk of Titans is an autorunner, of the same ilk as games like Bit.Trip Runner and Rayman Jungle Run.  That means that your character follows a pre-determined path and you are given the opportunity to perform actions at the right moments. The simplistic nature of the controls for such games makes them ideal fodder for mobile stores, and indeed, FoT started out as a mobile game whose premise - taking the myth of Perseus and turning it into a Blaxpoitation parody, complete with a version of Zeus that has a little more than a passing resemblance to Samuel L. Jackson. It doesn't take itself particularly seriously - the game is littered with nerd gags in the form of collectables and unlockables.  So, with that being out of the way now, what are we looking at. Three worlds, 42 levels in total, you're looking at around 2-3 hours of playtime if you breeze through without trying to get all three medals, around 6 hours of playtime if you're a completionist and call for all three medals on each level, try to level up to the maximum and get all 21 achievements. It isn't a challenging game, even for the most casual gamer, and relies a lot more on blunt memory recall than skill. The secrets (in each case a Pegasus statue that gives you one of the requisite medals and grants you access to an end-of-level minigame) are pretty much signposted - you might miss them on the first run, but you'll know where it is by the time you come to your second run-through. Said minigame, which involves Perseus riding the game's version of Pegasus (a jet engine with a horse's head mounted on it) is funny the first time, fun the next few times, and teeth-gnashingly tedious and monotonous once you've had to go through it the 50th time.  Controls are responsive enough, although combat doesn't require a great deal of skill, with some very generous collision detection.  Graphically, it's a straight mobile port of a Unity Engine game, so you're looking that's par for the course with this type of game - PS2-level geometry, texture and shadow effects combined with some very in-your-face lighting effects. The music, which appears to have been licensed from an external composer, is top-notch, and it's a pity that there's no separate soundtrack available.  Knowing what you're getting, Funk of Titans is a fun, functional little casual time-waster that'll give you a few hours of entertainment. But it's also painful to witness the potential of such an imaginative principle being wasted on such a banal principle, and I hope Crowd of Monsters revives Funky Perseus at some point to give us a fully-fledged platformer one day, because goodness knows, the imaginative story and style deserves better than this."
383780,Judgement,"It's an hour long at best (pending if you bother to read the notes and explore, 20 minutes if you just plow through the 3 areas in the game. Abandoned as well, so no Part 2. Several bugs, the worst being the commentary tracks aren't loaded properly, so I can't hear what they had to say about each pretentious scene.  The three areas you explore determine three checklists that are explained at the end, with two of them being reports you can't change even if you wanted to. Combat is okay, too simple to recommend over the weak story they wanted to make as of Part 1. They gave an example of Part 2 and so far it was the exact same scene in one of the areas that you have to repeat, but this time the 'wrong' decision is the right one for that character. It's a lame attempt at a joke they even mention in one of the notes...the butterfly effect.  I would not recommend buying this, but if free via a flash site, it's a decent time waster."
383790,The Ship: Remasted, Early Access Review
383800,Close Order,"It's quite fun, very very simple but fun to play which is the important bit."
383810,Doomed'n Damned,"Doomed n Damned is an old school action platformer which takes a great deal of its inspiration from ghosts n goblins.   Control: Control in this game is simple, but very responsive. You have a jump/double jump, alongside an attack button. If you press up + attack you use your sub weapon(like castlevania or ninja gaiden) It is simple but it works very well and I never ran into a scenario where I was killed due to unresponsive controls.  Level design: When you load up the game you are greeted to a map, you start at the first level on the map and then the map branches off into 3 paths. Each path has 3 levels and then the map converges at the end. The first level has 3 different exits and each exit takes you to a different branching path. In order to beat the game you need to beat every level.  Level design in this game is very good. The levels are pretty long, and most levels have different paths you can take to get to the end, the paths typically converge at the end but the different paths leave the player with room to explore and give you options on how you want to tackle the levels.  There is also a nice variety of things to do in the levels, of course you have a few standard platformy levels, but you also get levels that have you riding a horse drawn carriage, riding an elevator while avoiding spikes, running from a huge unkillable monster and other things to keep it fresh.  The challenge in this game is just right. You have 3 lives to beat each level, if you die all your lives, its back to the beginning. The game is not easy but it is not rage inducing hard either. You can't expect to beat every live on your first run but with a bit of practice nothing is insurmountable.  Some levels end with a boss fight, the boss fights are probably the low point of the game for me. Some bosses have annoying unskippable, pre fight dialogue. Not bad the first time you fight but after you die you have to watch the dialogue every time which is incredibly frustrating. The bosses themselves range from fun to fight to incredibly stupid and boring, for the most part they are okay but a handful of bosses almost put me to sleep while fighting them.  Overall, this is a very fun game, it took me 3 hrs to finish and for it's current price I feel you will get your moneys worth. If you are into retro games give this game a shot, the level design, control, and challenge are all just right."
383870,Firewatch,"A beautiful game with a very unique method of story telling. The characters are the best I've ever experienced in a game, and the writing is so realistic that sometimes I forget that I'm not playing through a true story. Well worth it for the price, and the replayability is definitely pretty good."
383930,Doorways: Holy Mountains of Flesh,"This game caters to a specific type of gamer. It is certainly not for everyone.  If you pay good attention to detail, enjoy puzzles, appreciate well-written stories, but also like some creepiness and the occasional (very occasional) jump scare, this game is for you.  This game also carries an element of mystery, you're essentaily a detective with a psychological gift, who is attempting to solve the mystery of a lost city. For spoilers sake, I won't say more. I will only say that the story is quite original and well-thought out.  The atrocities that take place in this forsaken city are grotesque to say the least. If you've got a dark side and appreciate some great atmosphere and a solid story, this game is for you. The score is also great. Voice acting is good. Visuals are done well.  Only complaint is that the ending seemed a little bit rushed. Other than that, one of the best horror-mystery-indies I've yet to experience.  8/10, would solve bloody skin-crawling mystery again."
383950,League of Mermaids,"This physics-based match-3 game seems like a good concept initially- it's a rather unique twist on the formula, and is easy to learn. However, there's a LOT of unpredictablility at play and you don't have enough control over the balls to get matches reliably. Furthermore, many of the levels are too gimmicky, and I found myself wondering if the game was playtested properly.   Also, I know that plot isn't really important in games like this, but the story in League of Mermaids was shallow(no pun intended) even by casual game standards, and it didn't seem to tie in with the gameplay very well.   All in all, it's functional, but not a stellar example of the genre. If you're really into casual games, it's probably worth a sale buy for a buck or so, but if you just want something relaxing to kill time with, there are better options out there."
383960,Machina of the Planet Tree -Planet Ruler-,"This game is amazing. I like how the creators thought of making a combo system for and RPG, not many have one, if any. out of 10 i give this game a 10"
383980,Rivals of Aether, Early Access Review
38400,Fallout,"I'm sure that when it was released, this game was really something, but I just gave it a shot last week, having heard a lot about the series, and found that it was extremely tedious and boring. I played Baldur's Gate through all it's slogging lowbie drudgery with a smile on my face, but an hour of this game is all I find I can muster. I don't know that I'll ever boot it up again."
384000,Cross of the Dutchman,"This was pleasure to play. The art style was very nice and the humor of this game was great. Combat animations were also very cool, it was very satisfying to hit things. The combat was pretty simple, alhough you had some sneaky missions. The main thing of this game was the story, which was very nice even if it's story we kinda already heard, but still it was nicely put.  It's not very long game but that is what I liked also about it. You enjoy every moment of it and you don't get overwhelmed. Yes, there were some things which very little bit annoying like reappearing destructibles, running certain path, no option to check your abilities and more), but this game is more about the story then the combat. I definitely suggest this game if you wanna have spend some good time with nice humor and chill gameplay.  7/10"
384010,Castles,"Didn't like the gameplay, liked the idea though, I found the gamepad configuration a little buggy and complicated, remapping doesnt work on gamepad."
384030,Florensia,"Well that was pretty terrible.  Pros: ......  Cons: Terrible graphics Annoying music No full screen mode Poor controls Cannot jump (seriously) Max settings is called 'hi' LOL  Save your time people, go get your kidney stones out, go to the dentist..Hey, how long has it been since you've gone to the ER?"
384080,Industry Manager: Future Technologies,"the game seems decent however, i am having a hard time playing it... i have a fairly huge setup (i have 6x 23 inch monitors) and it always goes to my top left monitor to play the game, i have to disable all except the one in center which is for some odd reason, is my primary monitor all my other games are going to the center monitor except this one  wish they could fix it like some other games that allow you to pick the monitor you want to play with  except that, looks OK"
384090,Sketch Tales, Early Access Review
38410,Fallout 2,"Best game of all time! The pop culture is amazing with massive horror in some areas as saving the whole human race from the United States and saving your villiage, but also the pop culture like finding a crashed Federation shuttle and becoming a porn star. Your decisons affect everything. For some cities there are over 8 endings. Ever wanted to shoot a mob boss with a phaser in the same city that you can box Mike Tyson, then moving on to getting a car. A CAR!!! But it will get stolen, pick up this game."
384100,Slybots: Frantic Zone,"This gets stale super quickly, even to my group of friends who enjoy hectic and silly local-coop games.  Maps and modes aren't super varied and are fun for the first few rounds, but grow tiresome rather quickly.  Fixed spawn points mean spawn-camping is super easy.  Could potentially be fun, just not for very long right now."
384110,Pathologic Classic HD,"In Pathologic, you play as one of three amateur and probably rather unqualified medical professionals who is visiting what appears to be an isolated post-WWII Russian factory town. You become trapped in the town when a sudden plague outbreak forces a quarantine, and you end up spending several days making necessary sacrifices so you can hopefully save the town (and yourself) from extinction. At its core, this is an adventure game, but you play it like a first-person shooter. There's a strong survival simulation element, as well. I'll break it down with a few pros and cons.   Pros"
384120,WonderCat Adventures,[ Fun: 2 | CTRL: 6 | GFX: 8 | SFX: 8 | Stable: Y | Replay: 2 ] [ Total : 3/10 ]  One of the best looking and sounding games I cant recommend on the PC.  + Looks and sounds amazing + Jump mechanic is simple and works + Bosses make surprisingly clever use of the limited mechanics  ~ Level design is ok ~ Gameplay is just too simple to enguage for long  - Gameplay is just too simple to be enguaging for long - Low res and simple play indicate a phone port for which it is perfectly suited
384150,TeraBlaster,"It is a very fun 2d game, besides it being very simple! Would give it a go, if I were bored."
384190,ABZÛ," Journey. Abzu.  Two games developed by the same director and has very similar design philosophies: a short, simple, semi-casual adventure displaying top-tier artistic vision and easy to grasp gameplay. You will see some of the best artistic design and hear some of the best soundtrack to accompany adventure. Also like Journey, I unsure of exactly what I was doing and why I was doing it."
38420,Fallout Tactics,A Post Nuclear  Tactical Combat  Game. Not A Post Nuclear  Role Playing  Game.
384210,Quadle,"Got this in a humble bundle.  Controls are kind of awkward, but if you tilt your keyboard it makes a lot more sense. level editor is an awesome touch, but as far as i can tell the user-upload feature is broken so it's missing out on a lot of free content. The worst part is how I get to the fifth level, pumped to cruise through this game, and it is crazily bugged (no cubes on screen, character not on screen, only shows the 'exit' cube highlight) and it instantly tells me game over everytime i try to play it. Super lame."
384280,Mute Crimson+,"Mute Crimson. Old school themed ♥♥♥ kicking platformer that will challenge you. This game has two parts, platformers and boss battle and they both be very hard. Thats what i love about the game and how its stands from other platformers, its difficultiy that will have you shouting at the screen or screaming in joy when beating that final boss battle. You will die a lot and thats the point, finding out where to jump and when to jump similar to Meatboy. It is a pixel game with a old school black and white theme and has some pretty cool blood effects that look amazing against the background. 9/10 would highly reccomend this diffuicult platformer that has a strong feel of megaman."
38430,Kingpin,This game has a sweet flamethrower.
384300,CPUCores :: Maximize Your FPS,Haven't a ♥♥♥♥in clue if this works or not so I just bought it on a whim anyway to see if I noticed a change (couldn't be arsed to verify it); I didn't notice any change in my games tbh.   I'll give this a thumbs up anyway because I don't really care about Steam reviews that much. Why not like.
384310,Dead In Bermuda,"I was excited about a micromanagment, survival game and wasn't disappointed. The art is very colourful and looks nice to me. Gameplay is fun. It was too easy around the end. Overall a worth-while game nontheless."
38440,Sacrifice,BF4 had better graphics 0/10
384480,Six Sides of the World,Amazing graphics for what could have been a very basic looking puzzle game. Great atmosphere and music too. In the end though by breaking the puzzle up into cubes it just makes the game harder to play without any real benefit. It might as well all be on a flat surface when you get right down to it. The fact that its cubes just makes it so you cant see what you need to see all at once. Still a good puzzle game but would be better fit on mobile for cheap with or without 3d.
38450,MDK,"Super fun to play and replay. Atmospheric and creepy. Requires a graphics patch, which can be found in the community discussion section."

384570,ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal,"Played this game offline a lot seems slightly buggy on Steam and the controls take a while to get used to. Nontheless, great game!"
384590,Polychromatic,A good relaxation arcade game ! (plus I handle it well!)
38460,MDK 2,the sa2 of third person shooters
384630,Aviary Attorney,"A delightful, witty game with:  - wonderful artwork (based on and taken from the work of J. J. Grandville) - a great story with some basic insight into court proceedings and principles - loveable and lovingly-loathable characters - classic music that fits perfectly - puns a-plenty!  Even though there is no audio for the dialogue, it's fun to read out loud with a friend and create voices for each character. If you have no friends this game will make you feel like you do, and you can still speak the screenplay in your head! Basic sound effects are used to enhance feelings or add to the punnery!  Albeit a short game, it's time and money well spent. Just looking at the artwork while listening to the music (and acquiring the occasional ticklish chuckle) is worth it for me!"
384660,RED Fuse: Rolling Explosive Device,A pretty unique game about causing lots of explosions and getting money for it.
384680,MechaNika,Best Game. Good Story. Gr8 Memes.
384690,Umihara Kawase,"This is a physics based platformer where your goal is to get to the end of the level. You are armed with a fishing hook and use this to swing around and about and defeat enemies or evade them. This game makes great use of it's complex physics and creates challenging puzzles based on your abilities. There is much content hidden behind movement mechanics, and there are many difficult bosses. That said there is a lot to do, I have played over 50 hours at least and still have not found everything, and still finding things and figuring things out. The Steam version has workshop support, leaderboards, and a level select option once you have found a level. The game has always featured a demo playback function, but for this release you can save your replay and upload it to the workshop for other people to see.  I dislike many of the bosses. Some are just boring and long, for example the first tadpole boss. And others are just unfair and frustrating, like the second tadpole boss and the crab. From what I have played, I think the sequel Umihara Kawase Shun handled bosses better, making them shorter, though not necessarily easier as that TWIN TADPOLE BOSS EXISTS. Needless to say, I don't play this game for the boss battles, though I do really like the two school of fish bosses and the seahorse boss is creative and adds even more variety as it's solution is neither combat nor evasion. I also dislike enemies randomly spawning, though if you play long enough you figure out how it works and it is pretty fair, they spawn in specific zones and it isn't like they will spawn under you or anything but will spawn ahead of you. If this is a dealbreaker for you, they have changed this behavior for the third game, Sayonara Umihara Kawase, which is also a great game which would function well as an entrypoint in the series.  I love this game, it is easily my favorite platforming series, you cannot go wrong with it but make sure you use a controller with a good dpad like the Buffalo Classic USB pad"
384700,Umihara Kawase Shun,"I've known and loved this game for years, but unfortunately this is a lazy port. This 'Steam Edition' doesn't have changes in graphics or interface. No mouse support, no key mapping. In the options you can assign commands to said buttons A B X Y R1/R2 L1/L2, even though you're not informed of what joypad you're supposed to use to play this game. If you don't use a joypad, you eventually find out you are stuck with the keyboard arrows and the keys A and Z. If you want a different mapping, you'll have to download a virtual joystick driver."
384740,CAT Interstellar, Early Access Review
384750,Everest VR,i6700 gtx1070 16gb ram htc vive all software upto date  loved it right up to the point where it just kept on crashing when it loaded the interactive part of the last two stages.... then the sound cut out... restart steam/game/pc doesn't help. if it worked it would be great if you are into mountain climbing
384840,Dead But Alive! Southern England,"Well, for sure that not best game ever, but it's good enough, with a lot of choices to make and an intriguing story. On the other hand it doesn't have a logical ending and that's really unfortunate. Waiting for the 2nd part, I guess."
384890,Hack Run ZERO,"If you've played Hack Run then this is more of the same but better. The clues are more subtle so there's a sense of achievement for working them out, the story is engaging and there's more of the same unique gameplay elements that made Hack Run a good game.  For those that haven't played Hack Run then I'll just say if you liked uplink and Hacknet then play Hack Run first and then this one, it's not essential to understanding the plot but some things may not make sense and you won't get some in jokes otherwise."
38490,Earthworm Jim 2,"runs much better than EWJ1, denetely a better Port, controlls are good and the graphics look good too (after some additional configuration)"

384950,Macabre,"oh blessed day! the stork has brought me down another bundle key from heaven, hand-picked by the sweet baby jesus himself. what have we got today? ruin! sounds good, as long as it doesn't ruin my relationship with the good lord! let us pray and give it a try.  oh no, is this one of those rpgmaker games?!? you see, i made a deal with jesus. i swore never to play any rpgmaker game ever in my life, and in exchange, jesus would bless me with the power to no longer wet the bed, and by that i mean i used to pee in the bed while i was sleeping. this seems even worse than an rpgmaker game, so i suppose i am not breaking my pact with god.  let me get this out of the way now. the only thing i plan on reading anytime soon is the holy bible. the bible has stories like the one where the puppet comes to life and gets eaten by the whale, while this game's story has some guy named fred. i know some of you think this isn't fair because the bible is non-fiction, but let us all face the fact that the bible is the best thing written. i just don't have time to waste reading anything as uninspiring as the text from a sub-rpgmaker game.  anyway, this game makes itself easy to quit. the best part occurs in the opening scene, when you get to see a giant asian guy that is sleeping in a hole in the ground.         Macabre&nbsp;"
384980,Battle for Blood - Epic battles within 30 seconds!,great game and nice merging puzzles and battles.   But  Screen size problems on systems. I have to make it super tiny when I want to upgrade troops or make it large for my actual battles.
384990,Gon' E-Choo!,"I played it..but why the first person? And this game you need a VR or something, since it's very hard to control and not sure if it's me but my game was VERY slow and had a delay. I can remcommend this to anyone who can play it normally, but as for me sorry I like this but can't even play it.. but it was nice to play it as it was a real arcade game tho. 3/5"
385020,AoF Chess Club 2.0,"Hey everyone,  &lt;edit&gt; I change the rating - because of two things which really brother me. 1. If you get a pawn throught it becomes automatically a queen. But sometimes this could lead to a stalemate. 2. There is still no clock. As well the community is still small and the game doesn't do enough imo to seperate itself from other chess games. &lt;/edit&gt;  in my opinion chess is a great game, I've been playing it for many years, in real life as well.  If you are interested in chess in general check out my guide:        Chess: A Beginner's Guide&nbsp;"
385030,C. Kane,didn't think it was funny
385060,The Last Warlock,"Do you love unoriginal, unfinished, and agonizingly slow-paced strategy games? Me neither.  Visuals style and sounds effects taken from straight from Minecraft. There is sooo much royalty free music from the moment you open the game to the victory sound. It makes the game sound and therefore feel unprofessional, unpolished and just thrown together. The audio can make or break a game. Furthermore, using Minecraft’s visual style makes the game seem even less developed. It’s just pandering. Instead of being creative or trying to create any sort of original style you put yourself in a position where you can’t succeed because people know how to spot knock-offs.  I don’t need to play anymore of this game to know I am not going to enjoy it, at all. In fact I regret even opening this game as now my average achievement score, which I work pretty hard, is lower.   I got this games as a part of a bundle and that is the only reason it’s in my inventory, there is no way I would’ve convinced myself to get this game. So many of its short comings are apparent from just the trailers that are available on the Steam store.   Go play any other top-down, turn-based strategy game, please."

385190,Celestial Tear: Demon's Revenge," http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/celestial-tear-demons-revenge-review/  - Full Review  Celestial Tear: Demon’s Revenge is a fantastic JRPG that’s marred down by technical problems. Built on the RPG Maker engine, the game has so many limitations, hardly any customization, and crashes too often to ignore. If you’re willing to wade through it though, and you should, the game offers an engaging and yet familiar storyline, a nice blend of battle systems and some stellar ideas. I felt like I had discovered a lost gem from the fourth generation, and I enjoyed all of the moments that worked. It’s clear that there’s some real passion behind this project, but the technical know-how may not be as strong as their creative drive. Hopefully they’ll get this all ironed out, and possibly consider a more modern engine and a VO director for their next outing."
385220,Pulut Adventure,Its a ♥♥♥♥ game bet it in ♥♥♥♥ing less than 5 minutes and then never played it again
385230,Ninjahtic,Very simple and casual game. Perfect for me
385240,Ultimate Arena,"Solid timewaster, developers even added a way to edit every piece of text in-game"
385250,Paint it Back,"I couldn't stop playing this game until I had finished it, I have no idea how or why it drew me in so much, but I enjoyed every second!"
385260,Lamia Must Die,"  TL;DR : creative but lacks polish 6.5/10 Single-battle rpg for free! Despite the fact that the game literally throws the player into the action with a complex UI (especially, for those who never touched RPG Maker in their lives), and no explanation of the items; this short game has quality voice-acting, creative skills and cutscenes, and creative ways of using the default engine. Overall, you'll probably won't like the game, but I'd still suggest you give it a go. If you use any RPG Maker, this is a must-play game for it's sheer creativity alone, I give it a 6.5/10."
385270,Jet Racing Extreme, Early Access Review
385310,The Land Of Lamia,"Confusing, annoying and short. Sorry, but this should dwell in mixed zone."
385330,Stray Cat Crossing,"I loved this game so much. Everything about it is great; the art, the music, the story, everything! I wish the game was a little longer."
385350,Deadweight,"It is somewhat fun, it gets a little repetetive after a while. I reccomend picking it up and waiting for more content to be added."
385370,Radiator 2: Anniversary Edition,This game....it's really funny and better than I expected. That's all I have to say XD Just play it.
385380,Planet Centauri, Early Access Review
385390,Hidden Mysteries: Civil War,"while playing i was thinking that maybe the game was made in like 1995 or somthing, when photoshop and game making programs were not readily avalible but considering this game was made like a year ago... i mean this is a failed high school computer science project for sure."
385400,Weapons Genius,controls are wonky and stupid. You buy a magazine and it doesn't even function when installed on a gun. only one body type which is stupid. this should be like .45 Cents. not 5 bucks. I bet Cr1tical AKA Penguinz1 would give a better review of this than I did. last beta was apparently 2015. Either this game is deader than most things or there is no support. save your money until a developer either fixes this or something with the same idea comes along and actually has more freedom.
385440,Buff Knight Advanced,"Seriously fun, and deeper than a lot of other infinite runners you will find on any platform. The graphics have a cool charm and the ps4 controller support is frankly amazing. One heck of a game."
385460,ATV GP,"abslotly ♥♥♥♥ w,s to move forward arow keys to go left/right"
385470,Railroad Lines,"The discription has a jack-ton of lies. I downloaded this game, because it said that I could build my own railroad. Of coarse this is a total fake. Worst yet, the company is getting money by telling us lies:  You cannot build or model a railroad.  All you have control of over the train, is going forward, backward, and stopping.  The only thing you can do in this game, is go in circles stopping at stations.   Worst yet you cant get past the first level, because whenever you do something that it wants you to do, you get penalized for letting stations overfill.   And still, the company get $3 for this freaking game. Whatever you do, dont make the mistake i did. Dont pay the money for this jack-ton of lies."
385490,MiniDrivers,Said that it was fun for the in game money but the game is just not fun on pc
385530,Astro Lords,Waste of time its all in russian.
385560,Shadow Complex Remastered,"The overall game design and gameplay is pretty fun, but it is way too buggy with relation to the movement of your character. Got stuck in so many places."
385590,Lethal RPG: War,its a nice little game :)
385600,Heavy Fire: Shattered Spear,"This is not good. Dated graphics, couple of crashes, very short and quite bad gameplay really. Heavy Fire: Afghanistan was better and was actually quite fun, if I remember correctly. It almost feels like this was made before that one, maybe it was, who knows."
385690,Wave Mechanics,Really nice puzzle game. It's challenging too. The puzzles are random for each user and if you get stuck you can start from the beginning. I stuck at level 21 so had to start over but after that I beat all   49   puzzles. c:
385700,Battle For The Sun,"Fairly good game for how much it costs, would say it was worth the money and was fairly fun."
385710,INK,Had a lot of fun playing this game. Got this game in a humble bundle and it gave me a good idea for a game that I now want to create. Thank you for the inspiration!
385730,WWE 2K16,"Fun if you are a wrestling fan, it goes for real cheap during steam sales, it's worth it."
385770,Time Clickers,"Just don't. I played multiple clicker/idle games over the years, and every time it's the same story. Before you know it, you have sunk countless hours in it without the smallest feeling of accomplishment. I could have played a real game, or several ones for that matter, in those 132 hours I lost with Time Clickers. I could have done something that made me happy instead. I should have."
385800,NEKOPARA Vol. 0,"Don't get fooled by the minutes I played this game. I mostly play it offline. Also, if your a type of person that likes girls, cats, and visual novel games then this game is for you."
385810,Retaliation: Enemy Mine,"So I got this thinking it would be a decent strategy game. And it is ok. The controls work well, the rules function as a concept, the layout simple. However, this game is boring. It is not any fun. A game can work well, but still suck. The point is to be entertained. Probably won't ever play it again after about 1.5 hours of giving it my honest effort."
385830,Burgers,Pretty terrible all in all. Would not recommend even for 65 cents
385840,The Beard in the Mirror,I LIKE this Kinda strange 'guy out of his element game' that plays and feels very old skool...some decent humor so far -hoping for more comedy ... I am not very far yet but Ill stick with it for a bit and update my review-  I am still having issues with FULLSCREEN--  I get an error when trying to go to full screen mode REGARDLESS of my selections in the AGS tool... I even installed AGS and no... the best I can do is get it to run at 1280 x 800 in a window- unchecking the window box simply causes an error message to display-    https://s17.postimg.org/ke6abf9i7/issues.png    https://s17.postimg.org/7y9khog67/ags.png 
385860,Tachyon Project,The whole 'hacking the server' thing is lame. The game feels slow paced and boring. The enemies are kind of lame too as are the power ups.
385890,Golden Rush,   Early Access Review
385900,Arevan,"I normally try to play RPGs longer before writing a review, but this has a lot going badly:  1) the walking around animation is jerky, which is really frustrating 2) even with battle animations off it takes too long to do anything in battle, and it's horrible with animations on 3) sound is in really short clips, that have jarring seams where they loop 4) poorly translated from another language 5) I only saw a few areas, but everything I saw was overly spread out. the first combat area was a huge complicated maze with only a few battles (no random encounters), so I just spent a long time following the right hand rule until I eventually found the other exit. 6) many visible seams in textures make areas somewhat confusing to navigate, and make them look very bad, even for RPG maker games"
385950,Infection: Humanity's Last Gasp,  Its very fun
385960,Russian Front,"Game needs hotseat mode. AI plays dumb: in 1941 a German AI will march AWAY from the border and will be slugging it out on the frontier until winter, even at the hard setting. There should also be some railroad movement in the game. Good basic design that plays slow and stupid. Better AI a must. Some tweeking to make the game more exciting would be nice too. Basic design is good and no bugs."
385980,Scott in Space,Typical 2d platformer Jump on head to kill and collect apples Repetitive background music 3 lines of story introduction  6/10 somewhat enjoyable
38600,Faerie Solitaire,Extremely repetitive gameplay and a generic story.
386050,Proto Raider,"Great, challenging game. 10/10 the best part is that it is made out of text"
386070,Planetary Annihilation: TITANS,"Planetar Annihilation -  Is it good? -yes  Is it bad? -yes  Why?  PROS: The game is unique, it has spherical maps in a interplanetary scale warzone you have multiple ways to destroy your target, from the conventional unit  swarming, to nuclear missiles, planetary lasers, planetary collisions, and a new way to destroy your enemies... Titans  Now not to say this game itself just adds Titan units, it also adds new units, and  more mod capabilities, the titans themselves are great fun to play around with from  the rolling terror that is Ares, to the armageddon itself, Ragnarok.  The game is interesting in its own way, the thought of a rts in a new map style is already ground breaking, but there are cons and those are...    CONS : Servers - now we all suffer problems like these sometimes, but the servers are a major  issue for everyone, its laggy unless you have like 2gbps internet, then i envy you. But this game is really laggy at times that you see your troops in one area, and  obliterated in the other.  Another problem is optimisation, now this game looks simple, yet pretty, but for some reason even with around low units, it can get really problematic, you need a decent graphics card to just  avoid crashes, and a better one to handle the unlimited units, and you need alot of ram just to keep the game from dropping when the armies start rolling.  The game doesnt do anything to the units textures when zooming to orbital view, or even when viewing other planets.   So do i recommend this game? Yes. Absolutely  But i recommend getting it on sale and having a beefy computer when playing."
386080,Pharaonic,"I wanted to like this game; I really did. It had a lot of promise, but it just felt bad to play, at least for me. It wasn't very fluid and, honestly, thought it felt rather clunky and unresponsive. It's not a bad game, but also not something I would tell other people to buy."
386090,Nandeyanen!? - The 1st Sûtra,"In a shmup, I take three things into account: theme, sound design, and art. Nandeyanen!? hs=as an interesting, well fleshed out theme, that theme being Japanese folklore, specifically, yokai.  The art is... decent. The sprites, both of you and your enemies, are nice looking, but far from amazing. They do, however, complement the theme pretty well. The backgrounds are stunning, though. The only plae the game really falls behind is sound design. The music's great, but the sound effects kind of f-cking suck. There's no real audio feedback when yout hit an enemy other than a faint, unsatisying beep. It's not enough to ruin the game, but it doesn significntly lessen the experience. All in all, buy it if you like shmups because it's real cheap and worth your time for the most part."

386290,Kumoon : Ballistic Physics Puzzle,"VR Review. It may be ok as a game on the Monitor, but in my opinion it's not really working as a VR Experience."
386320,Naninights,"A game trying to ride on the success of Five Nights at Freddy's, but just comes out short at everything.   1. Stuck at windowed mode 2. Crap graphics 3. Poor explanation of the game mechanics 4. Poor presentation 5. Feels rushed  Is this an early access game, a flash game, or was it simply made to insult players' taste?"
386330,HoD: On open seas,"I managed to play the first level of this game. When I walked to the doorway to go to the next area, I received the message 'Unfortunately, this is how far you'll get for now.. However, you are now a part of something that we believe in and we won't stop until this game has reached it's full potential. We are going to release a new chapter every Sunday'. I've owned this game for sometime but just barely got around to playing it. Are they in the process of updating it? Apparently, it was so bad that they are re-releasing it under a different title...I'm not quite sure. I guess I'll have to see what happens next but so far, I would not spend any money on this game."
386340,MegaSphere, Early Access Review
386350,Rise: Battle Lines,"Ive played my fair share of difficult and hard to learn games. Ive grown up with the mean games you could find on the NES/SNES and similar ones. But Ive seldomly felt as lost as when Ive clicked 'issue orders' in this game. This game is just really really random and it makes you feel really bad about the choices you make because theres very little to know about what happens at what time and why. What the game taught me that I couldn't have explained to myself: - all of your units lose 1 hitpoint if your general dies - Attacking units deal more damage than defending units  What the game taught me that I couldve explained to myself: - units have different place in the row (something like initiative) - units have hitpoints - units have more initiative closer to the general  What it didnt tell me: - how close to the general do they have to be? - can you tell units to walk here and attack there? If not why do the crossbowmen say cannot attack after moving and the bowmen say cannot move after attacking? Like what the hell? Is that a joke? - how do you know whether your archer can do something before his archer? Is it just random? Sounds fun.  And the biggest question of all - Why cant I give my units orders after one another? I cannot react to anything. Its the second unity made game with this weird restriction of giving orders pre-everything and I have no idea why. Its not fun all it does is make it random. Sure you can try to read what your opponent will do but he can counteract it by doing something differently. It all ends up being random.  Especially if you add in the fact that units of the same type seemingly randomly attack after one another, which can easily determine win and loss seeing that attackers deal more damage.  Overall I wanted some strategic game to play every once in a while but it looks like a mess to me. Sure if you can chew through it, maybe theres depth that will forever be lost on me. But Id rather get my refund through while I still can. It wasn't worth my 1.50 €."
386420,Job the Leprechaun,It's a really simple and short game that gets a vote UP due to a simple fact - there's really nothing wrong with it.   You control a Leprichaun and you need to collect all the clovers in each level (~35 of them) for the exit door to appear. You have 60 seconds to do that on each level and it's usually more than enough. And that's it.  Short and easy. With two easy achievements.
386480,Blood Code,"The art and music in this game are super pretty, and I really like the character designs. It's just a shame that the translation quality is so bad. It's really hard to get into the story or get much of a read on any of the characters' personalities when it's a struggle to even figure out what the characters are trying to say. The script is in dire need of some editing/localisation to make it less dry and literal, and to iron out the many spelling/grammar mistakes.  The translation is really my main nitpick, but obviously that's a key point when it comes to a visual novel. Hopefully that could be improved in later updates, in which case I might actually recommend this game."
386490,Wanda,"  It's with a heavy heart, I do not recommend this title, as my gameplay experiences were negatively affected by the lack of a resolution option. Which was a real shame because this title has a really good emotionally driven story, with an amazing musical score. I also believe the title is a bit expensive for 3 hours (at a stretch) worth of gameplay. I did enjoy the game, but unfortunately these two factors make me advise against picking up this title.   Please watch my video below for alot more information.         YouTube™ Video:  Wanda - A Beautiful Apocalypse | First Look Review!!&nbsp;"
386510,Pyramid Raid,I got this game for free :D  
386520,Champion of the Gods,"Must mention I am very dissapointed with the game, as it's not quite fair to call it a game. While the story was interesting and worth the price if you're looking for a good read, it has no replay value as a game. The choices are meaningless as a choice-of game, and instead are more like a puzzle (the correct, winning choice depends on your power). The rest of the choices are just filler with no real impact. I recomend the game as a good story, but going through again and again to get acheivements was mostly a chore, seeing that it's the same thing, to the point I only read the choices in most other playthroughs to get the right acheivement. The ending was the biggest dissapointment. Falls short of having any real impact, would have had a higher score if there was more freedom or variation in the ending if nothing else.  Again, written well for a good story once through, but not a choice-of game, no replay value (especially if acheivement hunting). Do not recommend if your looking for impact on a story or as a game, but if you want a cheap good book grab it if it's cheap enough."

386560,Psycho Starship Rampage,"Underrated gem, with great customization to allow for different playthroughs, randomized by what items you get in the after-level RNG, and in what items you choose to aim for on the map.

386650,Dungeons & Robots, Early Access Review
386690,Fantastic Contraption,"Similar to 'Bad Piggies' on IOS in principle, but in VR. I thought it'd be a hoot, but I'm just glad that game came for free with my headset. The gameplay is frustrating - you're supposed to assemble contraptions from a (very) limited set of objects (stick, balloon, wheel) and hit a target located approximately 10 yards away.   9 times out of 10 your vehicle fails not because you didn't build it correctly, but because VR counter-intuitively makes it hard to assemble the thing. It fails because a wheel is 5 degree misaligned, and the whole thing falls apart. You'd thing there would be some hilarious moments in there because of the wonkyness of it all, but unfortunately not because the designs possible are so basic.   PS: disregard time spent in game, I had trouble with my steam account at the time."

386880,Rake,"Good game for those who love creepy pastas. This game have not been updated since 2015 so I guess they have stopped working on it. I just bought it, but I refunded it again becuase it´s really no fun just walking around trying to shoot something that sometimes scare u a little bit. The graphics are not horrible but neither great. The rake is not scary at all, the things that scare you are the pop-ups and jumpscares.(and there are not a lot of them) The game itself is a good idea but it is not.... enough... I don´t want to say it is not worth 5 bucks (because it is if you like these kinda games) but the rake is just stupid. The AI of the rake needs to be updated. It just walks around randomly in the forest and sometimes he sees you and tries to kill you, then he runs away. 30 seec later the same thing happens again.A After 15 mins just walking around in the forest it is just not fun."
386900,The Cat Machine,"The cats are cute but the puzzles are just so unsatisfying and repetitive since all the levels are based around the same idea, just on larger and larger scales... The conveyor belts are also annoying to use and provide little to no value in the puzzle itself - all that matters is which junctions connect to each other... I've played Flash games that had more variety than this"

387060,Earth Overclocked,"2 hours deep:  Couldn't get out of the first stage. The dungeon levels are too difficult. End up fighting just with fists becuase the weapons degrade too quickly and there are either too many chests or too few.

387090,Revolution : Virtual Playspace,"When I first bought this product on early access, I thought it had a lot of things going for it. I spoke with the developer and offered my assistance to working on a wiki and helping to update guides. However I started to notice that less and less interaction, interest and response was taking place. Bug reports and suggestions started to build up and responses turned from we are working on it to simply being ignored. Sadly my time spend on the game was helping to report bugs and work on the projects i listed above. Sadly I was to late to realise that this project was a gimmick. The developer started a second project that as it seems to have also became the same thing. A WASTE OF MONEY!  I would strongly urge anyone looking at this or the developers other projects to stay away and do not give your money to him. I would hate to see anyone spend the cash and not be eligible for a refund, such as the case with me on this program. I have fought with steam for a refund and sadly they side with the developer and their refund policy."
387130,"Zombie Hunter, Inc.", Early Access Review
38720,RUSH,"My concise review: A clean, well-done puzzle game that is exactly what you would think of when you think of a puzzle game. Has challenging levels with complicated mechanics, and simple levels to get you going, and hints to help you when you honestly have no idea where to go. Little to no replay value (after 100%). All in all a good game!"

387270,Mystical,"dont buy this, its a crappy game with a really dumb puzzle idea. hard to understand at first, but once you get it you realalize its designed to prevent you from wining alot. your at the mercy of the ai dropping things you need, but instead will drop everything but what you need until the timer is almost ran out. i must of been the only sucker who bought this, so i warn everyone else to stay away."
387280,Inferno 2,"I love this game. It's as if someone took a bunch of the best classic arcade games, like Gauntlet, R-Type, Berzerk and Tempest, and stuck them in a blender.  The most hopelessly addictive game I've played in a very, very long time. If you're a fan of arcade style shoot 'em ups then I can't recommend it enough.  Buy it, launch it, and kiss the next few hours goodbye."

387370,Sol 0: Mars Colonization,"Sol 0: Mars Colonization is a fair little colony management game, especially given its price point. You start out with the basics; sending robot rovers ahead to chart the lands, then a cache of food and water, and if your rovers have struck water, it's time to send an actual astronaut and start building.  From then on, you'll constantly fight to maintain sufficient staff and power and to keep your colonists housed, fed, watered and breathing, all the while battling the worst that Martian weather can throw at you. If you're suffering from overcrowding or feel your colonists deserve it, the airlock is right there. :-p  The build order is largely the same on all the maps, but each map has different levels of resources available, and some lack certain resources entirely - this poses a fair challenge. This is also one of the flaws of the game; some resources are virtually endless (water, methane, ore), but others are completely finite based on the map (clay, gypsum). As the latter two are vital for your sophisticated food supply, the various climate disasters will eventually ensure that your colony will starve as you won't have the resources to develop new food strains to replace what you lose. Still, by then you'll likely have played for ages.  All in all, good value for your money, and a decent pass-time sorta game."

387850,Airport Madness 4,"Simple mechanics, but complex patterns. I find myself playing this every night.  You need to pay attention to the each aircraft's performance characteristics to time departures and modify the speed of landing aircraft. You can also send craft into a holding pattern, where you can control their direction and send them to a new runway choice, or you can send them off the screen to ease the pressure for a small monatary loss.  I wish you could modify the speed or direction of the departing helicopters.  The game play doesn't have enough depth to interest me in purchasing other games of the series, but I am happy I purchased this game.             "

There were some genuinely creepy elements to it, though, so it gets a little credit for that.  I give this game 2 grayscales out of 10 camera effects          YouTube™ Video:  vert tries...

388010,Tick: The Time Based Puzzle Game,"It doens't work at all, so many bugs."
388050,Snik,"Insanity is sometimes said to be doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Insanity, with minor adjustments, is the entire game mechanic for Snik.  Each stage in Snik requires execution of a series of moves thorough observation and careful timing. The component of the game in plotting the moves to obtain full credit on each stage is moderately easy, however carrying out moves involves excessive time, effort, and repetition. The likelihood of any move failing due to timing/execution errors is reasonable and the number of moves per stage is high - put together, tens or hundreds of attempts on a stage can be common and upon each failure only oneself is to blame as rarely are the planned moves impossible, they're just difficult to execute.  I enjoy games where most of the game time is spent strategizing, Snik isn't a game with that quality, it is &gt;95% game time towards skillful repetition, &lt;5% game time towards the initial planning of moves and adjustments. Some have the patience and obsessive nature to enjoy skillful repetition; do not buy Snik if seeking other types of challenges."

388080,Borderless Gaming,"Some games may crash on start-up when the app is active, but in general this piece of software is amazing.  Easy to use, hides itself automaticaly, custom resolutions and it may give you a performance boost as the games do not run in fullscreen. It also helps a lot with alt-tabbing in between apps without having to wait 1-2 seconds to switch from fullscreen to normal.  "

388160,Project Druid - 2D Labyrinth Explorer-,"I had hoped, when the game began with a paragraph of garbled English, that I would be in for a bit of unintentionally humorous gameplay. Unfortunately, the main character moves at a snail's pace (in contrast with his feet, which appear to be shuffling at somewhere in the neighborhood of the speed of sound), and the enemies consist entirely of Scooby Doo-style Halloween ghosts, each with their own bedsheet. I couldn't see the point of playing on past the five minute mark."

388270,Baseball Mogul 2015,"I was a bit skeptic regarding BBM15, but it turned out to be alright. It's an alright price/value, especially if you buy it on sale. As you can imagine, graphics are not that great, but it gives you a lot of in-game choices and it's a lot of fun playing it; I just wish I'd have more time to dig into it."
38830,CrimeCraft GangWars,Absolutely horrible. Not even really worth the tf2 hat or my time. Hat's nice I guess. All this game is worth. The game called me a hacker around 50 times and kicked me from the singleplayer mode. Took my way too long to get the hat when I should have gotten the hat in 10 minutes. But the anti-cheat system apparently absolutely hates me.
388300,Just Alone,"Woke up in a crashed spaceship, found a shotgun, seen a overpopulated amount of ducks and goats, killed as many as I could before I ran out of ammo just to find out they instantly started respawning. 420/666 would 360 noscope more ducks and goats."
388320,1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"An interesting informative and historical 'experience' which comes across as a sort of documentry- game. 1979 Revolution: Black Friday has adopted Telltales successful storytelling methods as well as some quick time events, but at a mediocre level.  You play as a photographer in Iran, documenting the 1979 revolution through his camera, but he gets caught up in both sides and finds himself in trouble. Based on real historical events, this game proved most interesting for learning about the past and hearing from both sides. Although, it stopped impressing me shortly after I became happily accustomed to this 'new' documentry-game mechanics.   Now for the bad:  The quick time events matched with clunky controls and an extremely short amount of time to contemplate pivotal decisions lets it down and almost seemed silly, they didnt really need to even be in the game. Sometimes there is not enough time to read all of the options, let alone to make an educated decision.  As many other reviewers said, the ending is beyond disappointing, it reaches the climatic moment and THE END.   And lastly, the game was over in 2-3 hours.  Although I do recommend this game, the graphics are nice, voice acting is great, story line is thrilling, choices matter and you can see the consequences of these choices. However, with the short game length, irrelevant quick time events, and clunky controls I could only recommend to buy this on a sale, especially if you'd like to learn a bit of history from a different perspective, in an interactive manner."
388340,Super Hipster Lumberjack,"Best Game 10/10. But for real its pretty good for someones first attempt at making a game. Cool gameplay mechanics and has decent graphics. Music needs a bit of work. The music in the pumpkin level is by far the worst, most ear-rapey thing ive ever heard. The rest was ok though. It seemed kind of out of place. Collision was also weird during some parts but didnt get in the way too much. I was also impressed when i discovered an easter egg (not telling where) although it was not yet complete and impossible to do anything with. The overall game was not too hard and well worth my 50 cents. :D"
388360,Shoppy Mart: Steam Edition,"Nice litte fair priced casual game with good support. I first gave a negative review because of a 'feature' that turned out to be an assumed bug. (see below)  -------- This game could be funny if bagging wasn't so stupid. Heavy products have to be packed under lighter products, but as soon as an item is dragged to one of the 5 possible places inside the bag it's stucked there and cannot be moved. You put two medium weights in the middle of the bag (to leave place for lighter ones) and then you get three heavy products. Well, too bad! Your products will be crushed. It doesn't help that I can switch products AFTER they've been crushed. The customer is complaining anyway.   It could have been coded better very easily: - stick products to their place not before releasing the mouse button - let me switch them inside the bag BEFORE I have to put in a heavy one - show the cart with all products, so bagging can be planned - let me leave products on the desk so I can pack them at the end --------  *edit Thank you for answering my review. I think it is a bug that happens only with seasonal products. In addition to that the customer says: 'It's ok. I'm not in a rush.', but I'm playing on easy so time should not be a reason. I'm hoping that this will be fixed soon. Or maybe disappears after christmas season?  Anyway... alone for the quick and pleasant reply I changed my review to positiv."

When I found out it was a game about reading by opening up the game (oh boy! so much work!) I stopped playing. This game might as well be an rpg with no animations or graphics. I am not saying this game is bad by any means, however, it doesn't grab my attention immediately as something I want to play. Maybe this game has an audience, but steam is the wrong place for this game. It is very interesting and has creative plot scenarios, and that about it... no jump scares, nothing. If you like to read, play this game. If you like to play games, don't get this one. I personally would not reccomend this game to most of my friends, but there may be like one or two that would be interested. How to make this game successful! Tip: Hire and animator"

388660,Project Tarvotan,"I've rewritten this review a few times. Each time, I'd go back to the game, thinking I should give it another chance before I asked for a refund. Each time my experience was worse than the last. The more I learned, the more I disliked what I saw.  Then I realized that I've spent too much time both on this review and on the game. Time I'll never get back.  It's simply a bad game. Move along; nothing to see here.  Barely worthy of Early Access, let alone a full launch.  There are some interesting ideas at play (which is why I bought it in the first place), but after playing nearly an hour, all I can think of is 'that's an hour of my life I'll never get back'.  I wanted to like it, the concept is definitely interesting, but the execution is simply terrible. Tutorial barely worthy of the name, horrid combat, unresponsive UI. Just bad design overall.  From someone who loves strategy and simulation games: stay away.  I feel a game should grip you/capture your attention straight from the beginning, and Project Tarvotan does the exact opposite of that. Maybe it gets better? Perhaps this would be my GOTY of 2015 if I gave it more of a chance, but I guess I'll never find out.  Time to go ask for that refund."
388680,Unfinished - An Artist's Lament,As someone who frequently suffers creative blocks I thoroughly enjoyed this short but beautiful and sincere game of artistic struggle.
388720,Link: The Unleashed Nexus,It is a little difficult for me to play it and my screen is not good.My fps is low. But the background music is very exciting!
388730,Brighter Day,"I can tell you why this is the best game ever created. You can collect drugs,u can throw drugs to distract big eye balls,there is funny music following u around. This game is not scary. Unless u got scopophobia,then just dont play this game. Trust me. Iam not lying to u."
388750,BlazBlue: Chronophantasma Extend,Good Game. I'd recommend it to anyone that has a soul.  But more importantly...  ARCSYS!!!  CENTRAL FICTION WHEN??????
388800,Azure Striker Gunvolt,"a Good Game, and good example that the side scroller akin with megaman x and megaman zero, can still be good games, yet the port is awful, and destroys this overall good game."
388830,TribeQuest: Red Killer, Early Access Review
388880,Oxenfree,"MUST.GET.IF.YOU.LOVE.LIFE.IS.STRANGE.AND.UNTIL.DAWN.  It's been awhile since i've properly went out of my way to find all the secrets and get glued to the screen. Oxenfree is a game that has time travel, scread teenagres, complicated relationships and TONS of mysteries which is always a plus in my book.  If you get pass slowpaced start and dig under the surface you uncover the actual gorey story. While the characters are a bit cliche they still are lovable.   10/10 would loop again &lt;3"
388900,Fracture the Flag,"Fracture the flag is an RTS game that has a different start than most other RTS games. That difference is the fact that you have to gather 4 main resources which makes the early game a bit more challenging. That's it. That's literally all they did. There is currently about 5 different troops and ways to attack bases. They are all equally unefficient and will eat up a ♥♥♥♥ ton of wood and build points. For some reason wood is the most annoying resource to get and you will always seem to run out of it. Build points are points that regenerate over time and are used in literally everything. You can go through 400 build points in a matter of seconds so most of the game is just sitting there and watching your guys do things while your points build up. This game has limited physics and not in the ways you think they'd be used. The only physics I've seen were on the stone walls that you can build in the game and when the buildings and artillery are destroyed. That's it. There aren't any random death physics for the 1 type of ground troop you can make. Oh did I mention the horrible lack of ground troops. You have a soldier, a ballista and a catapult. For some reason the catapult cannot move which means that if you make it somewhere far away from action, it will just sit there until it accidentally blows up. (which has happened to me multiple times and is very frustrating) I really do not hate this game because I adore the beautiful art style and huge potential. The problem is that they're selling it for $5.00. This game has no replayability and is just annoying. Until they add onto the basic fundamentals and stop working on the horrible skill tree, (the uses a ♥♥♥♥ ton of build points) they should not be selling this empty shell of a game."
388970,iZBOT,"Honestly I thought this game looked pretty good, like some super meat boy game that might be fun.  Unfortunately what I got instead was the kind of frustrating that isn't fun. Normally I like games that are very hard that I suck at (I wanna be the guy fangames), but this just made me sigh in mild frustration at every turn.  Its controls are reminiscent of Super Meat Boy, sure, but the thing it that it goes too far in both directions. You have 2 modes of horizontal transportation. A snails pace that cannot get you over the tiniest jump, and something that is too hard for any perosn to logically control.  Its level design is... well... it seems like the game encourages you to go fast. There's a timer, and the only other speed is unbearably slow, so go fast right? Well then why do they design the levels to punish going fast? I can't see what's in front of me until it's too late. And then the vertical sections, they make you use wall jump which makes you go way too far out and can't be controlled to try to avoid some pixel perfect traps. Okay, not pixel perfect, but they feel like pixel perfect traps in IWBTG fangames do, where I die to them for no particular reason, except it's not satisfying to get past them because I just felt annoyed when I didn't originally.  Am I the only one who thinks that the hitboxes were awful? I could be directly on top of something and die to it. The triceretops boss and the slime boss I would die when I jump on them and I can't tell why. I would often die to something I never touched, so I just don't understand what happened there.  The boss design was just bad. When the triceretops charges to one side then back to the other, his placing isn't even consistent. Did they not even take the time to make it so that he ends up the same place he starts? And if not why not&gt;  The music. Did it have one track or are they all just that similar and forgettable?  I stopped playing at leel 3-52 (which should be called 3-12, but they didn't reset the level numbers each world) because it just got boring. I died to things that I know I shouldn't have, and got sent back to the start of the level. I then died again. Those last two sentences are usually in games I find the most fun, but this game the dying was just lame. It means that I was basically speedrunning the level (the only thing close to fun, which is unfortunately discouraged by most levels' design) and then died to something before I could react.  I bought this game on sale for $1.99 and I don't feel like it was worth that. So I do not recommend this game, as $9.99 is then 5 times *less* worth it."

389050,Pocket Rumble, Early Access Review
389120,10 Minute Barbarian,"Enormous fun. One of the best casual games I've played in ages. In a time when games are multimillion dollar affairs that take hours to get into, this game is a breath of fresh air.  This game harkens back to simpler days -- 8 or 16 bit games that were simple, effective, and addictive.   Love it to (8) bits."
389160,Shadow Ninja: Apocalypse,"So, I wanted a little more info on this game and after some digging I got a to a review cite that reviews games that don't get the credit they deserve. It was harsh on it, but after playing I think it was honest and a generally fun read. The opening line was HILARIOUS!!!   http://samplebloggerbrothers.blogspot.com/2015/09/game-review-shadow-ninja-apocalypse.html "
389170,Songs for a Hero - Definitive Edition,"good musical, bad game worst boss fightes i\'ve seen"
389190,Goblins and Grottos,"I tried to like this game , I really did. But i cannot recommend it.  At its core it is a platformer with push puzzles , traps and physics. Problem is , the difficulty stems not from the game design but rather from the lack of it. Some puzzles require you to jump on chains but the chains move without logic , sometimes catapultig you randomly around the room , into spikes. There are purple mushrooms that act like springs , but they seem to ignore gravity and intertia and just catapult you as they will into spikes. The final straw was a room of cannon enemies , their shots bounce like a pool ball , completely unpredictable , and explode on top of that.  I've had the broken mechanics work in my favor at times when i tried to push a treasure chest up a lift to distract some knights , it got stuck , bounced off a wall and crushed both of them. Another time a cannonball took out three enemies for no reason , they all just bounced into one another and died without taking any fall damage.  If you can forgive frustrating mechanics the concept is unique enough to check out , but right now , as far as I am concerned , the challenge is not designed as much as a chaotic physics engine that doesn't know whether it's coming or going."

389460,Robot vs Birds Zombies,"Picked it up for 25 cents to collect and sell the trading cards, not even worth playing for the lil profit"
389470,Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet,"HOLY ♥♥♥♥ this game sucks!!!!! I grew up in the 80's and 90's, I played all the Sierra games, King's Quest, Space Quest, Quest for glory, Black Cauldron, you name it. This game has all of the bad aspects of those games and none of the good ones. The bad aspects are: you can't progress in the game until you have done certain things. That means you walk around forever looking for things to do. If you didn't talk to someone, you have to go do it. And you just can't move on. In the old sierra games, you might have to backtrack in the game to get a certain item or do a certain action. Here, the game does not progress until you are current with the plot. Here's an example: You go into the woods with your guide. He's carrying your camera tripod. He runs away. You use 3 branches and a vine to make a tripod. The problem is, if you don't have those items, the guide never meets you. So you wander around the game with a tripod, wondering why the hell you can't move on. It was this kind of crap that caused the death of the point and click adventure games. The great thing about the Sierra games was you knew to go back to an earlier save point and look for what you needed (I can't get by this laser. Wow, it would be great to have a mirror to blow up the laser. Aw ♥♥♥♥, I need to back up and find something mirrored). Now let's talk about the controls. In the sierra games you direct your mouse at the top of the screen and select an icon to do what you want. In this game, you have to press [TAB] to access those icons, and you can't even point and select like in the classic adventure games. You have to cheat! You have to go on the internet and find out the keys that correspond to each action. And on top of that, the keys are SLOW!!!! You have to hit (L) to see anything, and then walk around it and hit (G) over and over and over, to pick it up. Every action in this game takes FOREVER. Just picking up a branch takes MINUTES. The logic puzzles are fairly straightforward, but because they take so long to carry out, you're frustrated. You know you need to talk to the dying man, but you have to be standing in exactly the right position, hit (L), to look at him, then (T) to talk to him. By that time you're so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you don't even want to listen to what he's saying, you just want the game to PROGRESS!!! What would be fun adventure puzzles in an old Sierra game just enrage you in this game, because everything is so damn slow. It's a badly made game and you shouldn't get it. Shame on Steam for selling this POS. That's 6 bucks I'll never have again."

389700,My Bones,really short i mean REALLY short horror game i didnt see a monster in the game once and it took me 20 min to finish it
389740,D/Generation HD,Just a blast to play especially if you have played the original back in the day.
389810,Rubber and Lead,Awful controls. Vehicles don't even turn the way a vehicle turns. Just a cheap crappy game overall.
389840,Deserter Simulator,"this truly is one of the greatest game's of all time, to be remembered forever"
389870,Mugen Souls,"Another average game. Nothing exciting about it. There are a lot of things you can upgrade, but after finishing the normal ending I have found no use for most of the game. Why level a weapon if you can find another one that's better for free. You can level your character over 1000 levels if you spend enough time. I got my characters to about level 400. I don't see much reason for the excessive leveling. The game has a lot of story. Some with no voices, some with, and some story just runs automatically. I started a second time through the game, but it was exatly the same. Keep your stuff, but the enemys are level 1. Occasionally you run into an oddly strong enemy, just very inconstitant. One shot them before they one shot you. The game has way to much stuff to properly control the flow of the game. I have little hope for improvement in the sequel."
389900,Hogs of War,I loved this game on it's first outing and I was a much bigger fan of this than Worms which it is often compared too. It has the voice of Rik Mayal who is a brilliant narrator and it plays better than worms but sadly I can't recommend this as it won't allow you to play it on Windows 10 ( why sell it without the ability to play it on modern computers ). I hope they will correct this soon but sadly I am dissapointed that I couldn't play it/
3900,Sid Meier's Civilization IV,Great Game when it works!! 
39000,Moonbase Alpha,I have never laughed this hard in my entire life
390200,Queen's Quest: Tower of Darkness,"Another fairly simple hidden object game, the most challenging parts are the often badly indicated interactibles, that sometimes even seem to overlap and the morphing objects within the hidden object scenes themselves (well not really a challenge, so much as an annoyance). The bonus adventure too isn't particularly interesting or even challgenging and probably won't last you more than 15 minutes tops."
390210,FreezeME,"The camera angles are sometimes horrendous, the controls sometimes drive you mad, the odd level makes you want to put your controller through the screen. Absolutely stunning. Best game I've played through in ages. Feels like a Gamecube game that never got a release. Love it."
390220,Toilet Tycoon,I'm pooped. This game just flushes out all of the crap other games load up. Grab your Immodium AD and get ready to get constipated in the thick sewage of complexity that is Toilet Tycoon. You will be overwhelmed by waves of manure piling upon your head.
390290,Bulb Boy,"♥♥♥♥ed up, but visually impressive. You can finish this game in few hours but it will be a few unforgettable hours."
390310,Little King's Story,cool game :) worth a purchase
390330,Mekazoo,Great game but kind of plays it's self
390340,Umbrella Corps,"As a long time Resident Evil fan who's supported the series since 1996, I have to admit there has def been some rough moments throughout the years when it comes to spin off titles (Resident Evil Gaiden, Dead Aim, Operation Raccoon City) and while I'm not here to tell you Umbrella Corps is a great game, far from it. However suprisingly while slightly light on content, the game does manage to capture some pretty fun 3vs3 gameplay and a suprisingly in depth progression system and enough fun to be had for its $29.99 price tag. If they could somehow incorporate a Mercenaries style skirmish co op mode into the game it would def help the longevity of the title. As it stands Umbrella Corps stands somewhere in the middle of the Resident Evil side chapters go, and I will say its def better than Operation Raccoon City. That being said there is hardly anyone playing the game which for a MP only game completely ruins the experience when you spend anywhere from 10-30 mins waiting on players to join your match."
390460,Tyler,My best friends name is Tyler so i bought this game and i was suprised at how fun it was.
390510,Sim Junta,This game is unforgivingly hard
390520,PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist,I would rate this game 8/10. It was a fun little platformer with the fun sidequest to get all the patches. But multiplayer didn't work and the controller didn't work either. Maybe thats just me. But i still really enjoyed the game. The soundtrack was also VERY good. (also moist is a pea)
390540,High Fidelity, Early Access Review
390570,Three Digits,"I like the game.  (Editing this after 131 puzzles: There's no satisfaction here just because there's no human-viable heuristic for solving these puzzles. I've resorted to using the guide to get one side of the equation and then finding the other side, which is actually reasonable to do)  I don't like having the game not save an hour of progress. It's worth noting that I haven't lost progress again, but just knowing that it's possible for the game to decide you have to do a large chunk again... it's more than mildly annoying.  Three Digits is a game where there are 14 numbers from 1-999. All you have to do is find two groups of numbers with the same sum. It's fun for me because I like the math, but the scale is a little large: Two Digits was easy enough by getting differences and making the ones place match, while Three Digits feels a lot like a guessing game at time. 11 or 12 numbers would have been a little better.  The game doesn't save your audio setting. The background piano gets very grating very quickly and I've muted it every time I've started the game- and had to keep doing so! The UI is simple. Too simple- there's no back button, instead the game has to TELL YOU to use the Escape key to go back- on an otherwise entirely mouse controlled game! Oh and should you tab out for whatever reason, say to check IMs after finishing a level... you'll find the game does not advance while tabbed out. Meaning every single slow level completion/load animation can't be multitasked. This is a little nitpicky, but it's a completely needless addition and I'm already in an admittedly petty mood from this game.  Ultmately, there are way too many flaws with this game. Go play Two Digits instead- it doesn't avert all of these flaws, but it averts enough to be an enjoyable experience."
390660,Call of Tomsk-7,The reason I have a garbage subsection on my library page.
390670,Steel Ocean,"After playing this game a bit more:  Typical Free to Play Typical Pay to Win  This game is good at 1-3 tire, after that the ******** begins. Players who donate more deal more damage, can see a lot farther, stay hidden even when shooting,. Also they get better commanders and level them up a lot faster and that gives them: Longer detection range, faster reload, faster aim, boost to speed, speed of turret rotation, they can see enemies even if they are hidden in smoke, somehow boost their ship armour and armour penetration of their shells, and so on....  You can still have some fair games, but each day you get more and more cheaters.  Just how else can one player destroy the whole enemy team alone without being denected by 7 enemy players even once. Also his mechanic that if your ship is not moving it can detect better, and moving ships are easier to detect, many games, especially on hight levels, is just ships staying in one place and snipung each other.  Also there are no players to play with, you have to wait long for the match, and usually its 3vs3 game, when it supposed to be 16vs16."
390680,Spacejacked,"    An absolutely fantastic game    It reminds me a lot of Super Crate Box with tower defense mechanics. You are in control of a space dude with a blaster. The blaster has a recharge, it can only shoot for so long before going to a real slow semi-auto function. To aid you in destroying the intruding monsters on your ship, you have access to metal which can be used to construct defenses. What are you protecting? A core that controls your ship....when it's gone....you are gone. There is three rooms to defend and if one core goes they all go.  Defenses come in three flavors.    Stasis   This does damage while slowing your enemies. It is quite useful when it comes to aliens who move at a sprint or to just slow a crowd. It's the only defense that hits more than one target.    Laser   One shot, loads of damage. Due to it's cost and slow rate of fire I typically steer clear.    Turret   Shoots bullets at a high speed, least amount of damage. It has the long range however.  These defenses can only be placed in predefined areas. They are platforms that can be found on the floor or ceiling. Each of the three rooms have different layouts. Range is something to consider when placing these defenses. They can also be upgraded twice. Expensive, but nice to have. If you decide you don't want a defense, you can easily sell it for a refund.  I am currently stuck on the last day of act 1 and have only perfected one challenge. I'm only three hours in and only have one achievement...this game is pretty content full considering the premise.  I will say however the difficulty is astronomical. I didn't realize I had it on hard till the last day, but even on easy I am having troubles.   The price....eh, I honestly wouldn't pay 9.99 USD for this....I'd wait for a sale before purchasing.    I received the game for free...this did not hinder my opinion...my review section of my profile will prove that I have given games I have gotten for free with negative reviews  "
390720,Anarcute,my new favorite Indie Game 10/10
390730,Sora,"Common hard scroll shooter about Sora. I like the graphics and characters, effects are beautiful too. Gameplay is way too dynamic and boring for me. Sometimes you're take damages unfairly. I think that the price for this game is way too high. P.S. Also, I have some technical problems. Game crasher after Alte's death. I can't proceed and can't get the achievement. P.P.S. I really like bonus OJ character. Splendid work!"
390870,Circuit Breakers,"If you enjoy a game like Iron Fisticle (like me), this one is a good one for you.   Each level is a big room with hords of robots going after you. You need to go around shooting them while collecting energy for temporary weapon upgrade (that's the special feature of this game, no power up... only to keep energy high for weapon upgrade) and that is basically it except that you can played with 5 others dudes locally (did only solo play so far....but it was pretty fun.).   There is still few bugs and probably better documentation/tutorials for the game but once you figure out how to move and shoot, the game will procure good fun."
390880,Redemption: Eternal Quest,"  Quite a lot of screens that give you options. But it's just too much, to the point where you lose oversight. I don't find it very clear what I'm supposed to do anymore in-game or what to choose as option.  "
390890,Angry Arrows,Remember the headcrabs from Half Life? Yea.. they're explosive now.
390910,Collisions,"Took a chance on this seeing no controller support listed. I like to play using an xbox-360 controller running Controller Companion. And it seems to work well for what little I played, also it is enjoyable. A nice game to play kinda in the background not having to be so involved in it while multitasking."
390920,Army of Pixels,Was great for what it was until the last few missions. 2nd wave and you've got 2 catapult slimes already? Nah.
390930,AIPD - Artificial Intelligence Police Department,"This game was pretty fun, but only for about an hour. Unlocks took a bit too long to unlock. I was already bored of my existing weapons by the time I got the new ones. The game lacks any real ability to bring yourself back from poor performance so it misses out on the rush of a comeback that games like Crawl do so well. Surviving a level was always overshadowed by 'well now my health is low for the next level.' The sheer amount of enemies can be a little overwhelming so I always ended up missing the enemies that really mattered until it was too late, which would be forgiveable if all punishments didn't hurt your entire run. I also may have been missing enemies because the camera is not centered on the player, but enemies can still come from the short side of the screen which gives them an arbitrary advantage. Ultimately it just ended up feeling like a slow crawl towards inevitable death and that crawl didn't feel particularly engaging."
390940,The Musketeers: Victoria's Quest,"Really good time management game where you have to pay attention to resorces closely, otherwise you'll run out of something you need and have to restart the lever. Nice to see these kinds of games on Steam. If you enjoy a thinking type game here and there grab this, Ive been enjoying it even with the 'Oh crap, 20 minutes in and I messed up...lol '"
3910,Sid Meier's Civilization III: Complete,"When I remembered this game, I remembered it to be more fun and easier to play, the UI is rather bad for this time and place, yet still it is the good ol' Civ 3. A classic that defined the genre, bogged down by it's modern counterparts."
391000,Farm Frenzy Collection,very good to do in free time
391030,Hard to Be a God,"I recommend this game with all my heart ! :) BUY IT ! YOU HEAR ME ? BUY IT RIGHT NOW !  SCI-Fi RPG, but still very true with the human thinking about this earth. If u have qustions, ask me ! I am ready to answer to them all ! FOR REAL, JUST ASK!"
391040,F1 2016,"Take a while to get used to it, but its worth the effort.  Some advice that helped me so far:  Get a joystick or wheel Repeat the practice until you pass  If you are into F1 or car games, want some adrenaline and a good passtime.  This is for you "
391050,AquaSnap Window Manager,"This program makes organising all my chat windows (Steam, Discord, IRC) really easy and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has issues dealing with that. If you're not convinced there is a free version with less features on their website."
391070,Stellar 2D,It's fine
39110,Season of Mystery : The Cherry Blossom Murders,"Took me 6 hours to complete everything with all achievements. NOT worth 4,99€, way to short and easy, didn't really try that hard. HOWEVER it is a great game, intresting storyline and fun while it lasts. Wouldn't spend my money on it though."
391100,Frizzy,"This game is actually one of the best games ever, I believe that it is the HEIGHT of gaming, a true example of perfection. Alas, no words can describe the amounts of joy, sadness and hatred felt in my under 1 hour of playing this TRUE example of perfection at a divine level. I dont know how these developers created such a fantastic game when supplies were dwindling after the great war of Vladmir Stalin in this era. I simply do not know how to rate this masterpiece, but I can try to explain on laymans terms with a simple 'r8 frizz/rizz m8' "
391120,The Archetype,"I was able to try this game pre-release during a live-stream, and while there were some bugs here and there, the devs were awesome enough to hotfix on the fly, so they're definitely attentive to any problems that may arise, which is a definite plus!  As far as the game itself goes, I've had a great time with it. I feel it gives a great, creeping horror kind of feeling, which I get a lot more enjoyment out of than constant jumpscares, which tend to wear thin after a while. The disconnected controls can sometimes make things a little difficult to focus your view on, but with what Archty has going on in his head...well...it just ends up adding something to it. It starts to feel like a disconnect between your hands and your mind, which actually ends up being a pretty effective way to express his instability..It's not easy for him to focus on things, so why have his focus be locked to the center of the screen? It ends up disorienting you, forcing you to focus more on what you're trying to do, so that when the game does unleash one of its scares on you, it catches you completely off-guard because you'll glimpse something out of the corner of your eye, question whether you saw it or not, then get hit in the face with it when you go for a second look. So I can see how it can be frustrating, but thematically I feel like it really makes sense.   Now that the game's released, I definitely plan to start going through and seeing how various things affect the different states, there's chances for a lot of things here, and for it being a first game from a 2 person team, I was impressed. Definitely can't wait to see the effects the events of Chapter 1 are going to leave on Archty in the coming chapters, especially as the team hones their skills to the fine point of an ice pick, to bury in our mental states."
391160,The Deletion,"Totally fun!! It's a brain teaser that will be sure to keep you playing for hours! (BTW, I'm stuck on stage 4)"
391170,Void Invaders,"Very pretty, but very poorly designed. If you like pretty lights, go for it. Otherwise, try any other galaga clone."
391180,Ladra,"I cannot progress at all in this game, due to a bug in the very beginning of the game where a guard that previously moved around, stops in the middle of the room after getting the main tressure. I mean, I don't know what I expected from a game I got for $0.59, but I hope it gets fixed, this looks interesting enough. ;)"
39120,RIFT,"In my opinion its better than wow. Very nice graphics, low system requirements, and its free. The rifts and public events always seem to keep the game fresh and not too stale and repetitive."
391210,Arclight Cascade,"Great fun, it feels a like Starwhal meets two-stick shooter without the ridiculous physics. Really good as a local multiplayer game with 4 gamepads. Graphics and music are good too."
391220,Rise of the Tomb Raider,"The TB is worse than last one, because the story and the sence is not rich enough and we walk the back path in some sence, I hate walk back.  Hope next will be better story and do not waste my time on walk back path."
391240,Forgotten Lore, Early Access Review
391250,Alien Robot Monsters,"It's the standard TD deal, not better or worse than most in this genre. Graphics are very simple and background textures look dull. It's an OK TD game, but don't expect the same high class as f.ex. the Kingdom Rush series."
391260,Labyronia RPG,This game game is not that bad the music can get annoying but for 40 cents you cant really hate it that much. over all the game is a little time killer and nothing more.
391270,Fingerbones,"This game is not the best. Poor graphics. Short. linear. I did hate it, but I did not love. But it's free. For a free game it is a 6/10. This gets an extra point for its warped story."
391280,Epic Manager, Early Access Review
391310,Alien Attack,This game is ♥♥♥♥ lol Not being a ♥♥♥♥♥ I die so easily   Make a bigger map  + Too expensive for a game that doesn't have another map
391340,Ferrum's Secrets: where is grandpa?,"Badly translated text. Uninteresting puzzles. Dull story. Oh, and has anyone else mentioned the fact that throughout the game, you use objects by dragging them from your inventory over the thing you're using it on... until one specific thing, near the end of the game, where that method doesn't work at all; and without warning you instead have to right-click on that one thing?"
391390,Mayhem Triple,Fun concept and good controls with a lot of personality but the shooting gets boring really fast and there's not enough variety to the gameplay to keep met interested. You just shoot the same enemies over and over and the guns mostly feel the same with only a few exceptions.
39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"It might say i have 2 hrs or so but believe me i have played 7 multiple times Ps1 ,psvita ,digital download, roms if you dont like the graphics you can download a mod to update the graphics but when you have a great game witha great story you dont need graphics! this is one of the best final fantasy games out there i like 10 more but this or 10 is a great start to joining the final fantasy franchise if you want to wait for the remake and play 10 in the meantime!"

391440,XenoBloom,"Dont buy it.  i really wanted to like this game, but there is really nothing there. gets boring so fast that can be hardly a game itself. it can be a bit fun if you are under some mind altering drug effect, i suppose... but, eh...  03/10"
391460,WARMODE, Early Access Review
391490,Braveland Pirate,"I'm a huge fan of the King's Bounty series, I've completed them all. So I thought that Braveland Pirate would be somewhat like King's Bounty light. It is in a way, it has maybe 10% of the complexity, variety and fun factor.  BP isn't terrible but it is mostly a grind. There is so little strategy in the turn based battles (99% of the game) that you can pretty much sleep walk through them. I can't really recommend BP because for the same money you could buy any of the Kings Bounty games."
39150,FINAL FANTASY VIII,What can I say its Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy always gets A+++++ If a cereal is using the trademark Final Fantasy I'll buy it in a heartbeat basically anything with Final Fantasy label on it.

391540,Undertale,"You may read this because it's short. I know.  I'm just going to quote my friends here: 'Nothing I write here can ever serve this game justice.' I say that unless you just don't enjoy the game or hate the fanbase, a negative reveiw is full of crap  My friends full review here:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProPlayerRyan/recommended/391540/ "
391550,Beyond Flesh and Blood Episode 1, Early Access Review
391580,Egyptian Senet,"What started as a good idea to combine Egypt and a boardgame ended as a deception for me. This game is like Sorry! the boardgame with the annoying rule to land on the goal precisely. The music doesn't sound anything like Egypt. The pictures are good but there is no animation, just sliding pieces and premade roll of sticks (as dices). The rules are printed in a long text to scroll down instead of a neat tutorial. Overall, who wins the game is purely random and I don't like."
391590,Dream Chamber,"Ok so to be honnest i have played alot of point and click games, this one aint that bad, it isnt good either to be fair.  if you look at all the + and - of the game i can only conclude that that for a game priced at €4.99 ( steam offer ) it isnt that bad and u will have some fun. priced at €9.99 ( normal price ) i would suggest you wait untill a steam offer comes by again.  pro's : funny and some humor, kind of a nice story line in it, enough to click. Con's : borring at some time, puzzles sometimes to easy other times to hard, no real sence to some dialogues.  6/10"
39160,Dungeon Siege III,"On occasions of boredom over the years, I have tried to get into this game and it never grabbed me. My instincts in this area have been Nostradamus-level and so it finally is time to Thumbs down this damn thing."
391630,Necromonads,"Not an amazing game, plays a lot like Defender. For the cost, it is a very good deal; especially on sale. If you like SHMUPS, this is a good game to add to your lacking Steam SHMUP collection. It has very nice visuals, simplistic but very nice and a grand tribute to retro games, and the gameplay is very simplistic which is perfect for this genre sometimes. Definitely worth a buy for fans of Defender or the SHMUP genre."
391660,Incitement 3,"  Received Free from Rezzed 3 Game Mystery Pack. This is a JRPG style game similar to that of Final Fantasy VI. I didn't get very far before I was saying 'nope' and the very first battle had me feeling bored and frustrated after I had used 3 attacks and 3 special moves on a guard and he still wasn't dead... My time is precious, sorry."
391720,Layers of Fear,"Ultimately broken. Originally, I gave this game a thumbs up. I enjoyed it. It is atmospheric and is clever. But then I hit a bug that was game breaking and there was no way around it. No patch was ever released to fix it, though others had similar issues. I was never able to complete the game, though I wanted to. So I cannot recommend this game. Don't pay all this money for an incomplete product."

391820,Evolution,such a disapointment i was told this game was good i want a refund
39190,Dungeon Siege,"Lets me explain it as simple as this...  'Dungeon Siege' and 'Dungeon Siege II' are superb and brillant games  (even for their age) , it is a shame their is no multiplayer option on Steam, which like all other players of this game I am disgruntled about. With that exception, you want to push this game on the higher settings more and more, and it is a shame there is no impossible setting to try.  Awesome!  Now 'Dungeon Siege III', is an unbelievable disappointment that carries no elements of it's predecessors.  Stick with the first two in the series, and mentally rename the third to not taint the titles.  -Universal Gamer"
391960,Super Mega Bob,"Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.  Check out this review and others at Nouse Gaming:  http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/  ------------------------------------------------ Maybe I just haven't given this game enough of a chance. Maybe as Super Mega Bob continues it begins to unravel into an epic tale of love and loss with excellent mechanics and level design. Maybe it's a clever twist on the genre that you only find out several hours in (like Spec Ops: The Line). But if somebody who's almost professionally obliged to give the game at least an hour or so of play can't face anymore after about forty minutes you're doing something wrong.  The opening cutscene is a sweet if generic tale of some idealised world torn apart by some kind of explosion. You (as Bob) with your new pair of hands set out to find your best friend and lover. There's a lot of story strewn throughout the levels which you can find but again it's mostly fairly generic and uninteresting.  The game play has you floating around a world either killing 'x' enemies or collecting 'x' coins before reaching the end of the level. Enemies mostly ignore your existence and are more like obstacles to avoid and with the added time slow avoiding their bullets is easy. Not only this but almost immediately I found that my range far exceeded any opponents so I could easily sit back without risk. The game is shaken up a bit with the bosses and mini-bosses and these present the main challenge in the game, despite this they don't really add much only needing to avoid more difficult bullet waves and taking more damage.  The game seems to have a fairly in-depth upgrade system which is almost completely unneeded. You can both craft and get upgrades as drops which are mostly fractional upgrades to your speed, attack and range. However these RPG like upgrades just don't match the platformer but not really style of the game. The sound design also swaps between being boring and outright annoying. Many of the sound effects are ear splitting and the music tinny and annoying such that I turned off the sound after only a few levels.  The real moment that made me quit out was when I reached a room where I needed a bomb to reach the end of the level. However I had no bombs on me nor were any present in the room. In order to clear it I'd need to back track to a previous level pick one up. This kind of backtracking was simply something I wasn't prepared to do and probably means that there is more of it further in the game.  Super Mega Bob feels like someone's first project, and maybe it is! But if that's the case this game belongs on sites like congregate for free not on steam even for the relatively low price of just over £3. "
3920,Sid Meier's Pirates!,"Fantastic. Definitely recommended by me.  It has a good bit of replayability and a bunch to do. Worth ten dollars for sure. If you get it on sale, it's even better of a deal, considering I guarantee that you'll get your money's worth out of it.  You take the role of a pirate during the 1600s and can plunder and loot as you see fit. There is indeed a story line, but if you wish you can simply sail around the Spanish Main and plunder various ships.  All in all, definitely recommended."
392000,TRON RUN/r,"I bought this game and all the DLCS during the Steam Winter Sale at a 70% discount. This game is really fun, similar to other Tron games and Bit.Trip Runner 2. There doesn't appear to be a lot of people that play it, I've already made top 10 the leaderboard for a map within the first 24 hours. The music is no Daft Punk, but it's enjoyable enough. My only complaint is that when customizing your character there are 3 different shades of blue but no orange, like all of Clu's minions including Rinzler (who is playable). There are weekly contests, the current week is 17 minutes straight on a randomly generated map, that seems rather excessive to me, but since I am new I'll see if it's doable eventually."
392020,RFLEX,The price gave me cancer.
392030,Murasaki,I can rave to this (esp Distant Thunder..) A distinct example of videogames as a necessary form of communication.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,Just finished making my avatar.
392100,Fatal Theory,"Lots of good things going on here. The game has a snarky, abrasive humor. Beat-em-ups can be fun. Some upgrades etc.  The controls are not great. But could be fixed. The labels for the controls are not interactive so I had to experiment with my Xbox controller to make it work.   https://youtu.be/gDoAHU_HCqE "
392110,ENDLESS™ Space 2, Early Access Review
392120,City Z,And they come... over and over again! Survival mode is awesome! The game is in active development improving day by day. The procedural maps makes every game to be different ensuring hours of killing zombies.  I am missing some feedback in the screen but makes the experience even more challenging!
392190,#SelfieTennis,"Cute, but shallow. Almost no gameplay of note, and what little is there is flawed. Why does it put me in a position where it is virtually impossible to return the ball every 5 hits? Why do the stupid guys fall into the court and then just roll around forever?   Boring and stale after 2 minutes of playtime. No thanks.  To make matters worse, the devs think making snide comments on your review will somehow entice you to come back and change your review. Or, perhaps, they just can't handle any criticism of their awful game."
392230,Littlstar VR Cinema,"Littlstar is a free, 360 degree video client. I've tried it on my vive, oculus and gear VR, and you've got still more options in daydream and desktop client. It's really well implemented, clean user interface, great video quality, options to favorite. It's light on content at the moment, but the videos I did try were excellent. I watched a CES overview, some excellent travel and tourism videos, a cool gaming video. It's super! I reccomend it!   Only suggestion I have is, why no 3D Content? VR is all about 3d. Let the kids on facebook have their lame 360 degrees. VR is for 360 degrees and 3D! Videos should pop!"
392260,Rogue Wizards,"I regret supporting this, the game is clunky and poorly paced. Not exciting or fun in the least bit. Stick with 100 Rogues or some other classic roguelikes on Steam."
392330,Take Command - 2nd Manassas,"I've played this game before it came on steam but I'm excited to see it finally make its way on here. It's a great civil war strategy game that doesn't cut corners on realism. Orders are dispatched via courier, you can choose to control a brigade or and entire division and up. The battles although graphically lacking last quite some time and feel vivid in their own way. The tango of grey and blue charing forward then pulling back, the constand popping sounds of the muskets and periodic thunder of cannons. Defintely recommended for fans of real time strategy/real time tactics."
392410,ToyOdyssey,"Man this game is hard as sheet. I mean, the gameplay's great, but healing's unreliable. You don't really lose much when you die, and I haven't seen a whole lot that penalizes you for dying besides the map resetting. But it's still annoying."
392450,Silver Creek Falls - Chapter 1,"Cute game with good story and mystery, but could be a little longer."
392470,NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Sphere of Influence,hm... so i'm very dissappointed... i just brought this game like a hr ago today and its crashed 4 times already... didn't save any of the officers i created... doesn't keep the settings that i want... i would like a full refund where and who would i go to and ask for this cos i really don't want to keep this game or try to fix it... not worth it... thanks and someone answer my question for me thanks...
392580,WARSHIFT, Early Access Review
392600,Volvox,"I am sad to give this a thumbs down as it has a lot going for it. It is one of the most original games I have seen, it is excellent value for money, it has been made with a huge amount of love and care, and it is extremely clever.   The trouble is it gets boring quickly. I am quite sure that I am exactly the right sort of person for this game. I like intricate puzzles, I like geometry and combinatorial maths and I am unusually patient. But I found I was doing most of the levels by trial error. The ones I hit upon quickly were unsatisfying and the ones that took a long time were frustrating.   I still want to congratulate the developers. It really is a nice idea."
392620,Lucadian Chronicles,"Amazing collectable card game, and it's free after the first purchase!  The battle play itself but it's not an easy game. There is a lot of challenge in selecting the cards for each battle, it's a very good puzzle game.  It also has a storyline and PvP mode.  There is also drafting PvP, while it is well designed, it is unfortuante that there isn't enough players for drafting so some times it's hard to find a game."
392680,Jeeboman,"Great game at a great value! This game captures the feel of having mega mans powers in VR. Beautiful colors and nice polish, could use more modes but for $10 it's a solid VR experience I keep coming back to."
392720,Daily Espada,"Daily Espada is the newest indie from Pedro Gabriel, pits an ordinary man against Brazil’s most bizarre and exciting fictional game show. Our hero will be given a sword and a gun and forced to fight against hordes of Brazil’s greatest mythological creatures in exchange for fabulous prizes. The sword gives our hero the power to transform in a super-sentai kind of way, donning a black suit with red accents that give you additional more powerful combos and a super ability. The gameshow’s rewards are fantastic, and will ensure our heroes family will be set for life.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJocF1uCaqQ  The first thing I noticed about Daily Espada was the colors, the game features a dark background with beautiful bloom lighting and the colors are fantastic. Unfortunately this can get a little confusing, with the enemies being black, with accents of color, and the player wearing a black power suit with they are transformed. The result is that the only color on screen is the players black and the attack animations, which creates a striking picture consisting of lights and darks. Lighting is sufficient at most times, but more than once I found myself confused by the dark.  The gameplay feels good. It’s the best of 2D style hack and slash. Controls are simple, but leave room for both high skill and new players alike. The core mechanics are classic hack and slash, see enemies shoot then and slash them, until they die. This is fleshed out with a combo system that while simple to use is difficult to master. Most rooms feature a chest that can be unlocked by defeating its enemies. These chests contain upgrades that get you better and more exciting combos and slashes. The bosses are big, and the enemies in between offer just enough depth to keep the game interesting. The average boss fight took me about 10 minutes to complete!  The games map is almost like a metroidvania game. A central Elevator corridor houses elevators to each level, the layouts of which are often labyrinthine. I often found myself retreading the same floors fighting against the same enemies while trying to find a boss elevator, or figure out where the heck I was. Aside from my inability to remember where I had and hadn’t been the game would benefit immensely from a map, however not having one lends it a difficulty and a mystery that makes for interesting if slightly repetitive game play.  Daily Espada’s story is well told through voiced story bits, emails that you pick up from terminals and signs on the wall. It’s a simple story told as far as I can tell in 4 acts, one for each boss you fight. The game then gives you the ability to continue on to harder bosses, but to mention more would be spoilers, so go play the game!  For a game that started ut as a free tech demo on itch.io this release is extremely well polished, I found very few bugs, and the visuals are nothing short of stunning. The bosses feel huge and even on moderate difficulty levels gave me quite a bit of trouble. I love the colors, and the arcadey sword play is easy to learn and hard to master. The story lacks a bit, with much of it told through text terminals, but for what it is I really liked Daily Espada. There are half a dozen difficulty levels and tons of re-playability built in. The story was short but not lacking, and I was satisfied with the length of the main story (about two hours to play)."
392780,Mondrian - Abstraction in Beauty,  The phsycs in Mondrian make absolutely no sense and the rewards purchasable with in-game currency are wholly unsatisfying. I would be mad if I paid money for this game.
392790,Football Manager Touch 2016,little mn kick balls and some other stuff . i like it
392820,Wild Island Quest,"What... that's probably the simpliest and somehow poorest 'choices matter' game. Visuals are made in 3D, but they look stupid anyways. There are no animations. There is no real-quick skip option...  Game's forcing you to press the only option you even have... that's annoying. Music that is very annoying with 2nd playthrough. Too many sounds and poor narration."
392920,Arvale,"Fun game, though slow-paced. The battles are slow at first and unnecessarily drawn out (takes 3-4 hits to kill each enemy and it misses a third of the time), and Duncan's walking is also slowwwww as hell. It seriously needs a dash/sprint button option. Recently, we've run into a bug where the game is laggy and can only be fixed by turning on one of the compatibility options, clicking 'Apply,' then turning them off again (and clicking 'Apply.') Right now, the major redeeming factor is the story and humor. As it is right now, I wouldn't recommend buying it, especially since the developer hasn't responded to the pinned 'bug report' thread in months."
392930,A Sirius Game,Purchased since it looked like Pirates! Not bad for the price.
392940,Epic Quest of the 4 Crystals,"Yet another good rpgmaker game ^^  +Good storyline +Good textures and models +Great black humor +Good combat and inventory system-Pretty straight forward-Lack of interaction with world objects  Overall; Quality 2d rpg game with great pinch of humor, a must buy for fans of this genre, on the other hand if you want to try it and yet not sure, buy it on discount.  Disclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing"
392950,Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure,"Microtransactions. That's not usually enough for me to dislike a game, but they are so integral to this game that I just could not continue playing what felt like an extended advertisement for more microtransactions. You earn boxes, but to open them you have to solve a puzzle. To solve the puzzle you must spend energy, to get energy you either have to wait or spend gems, and to get gems you have to pay. All of the puzzles are timed in an effort to force you to lose energy faster, and thereby force you into a position to pay them for this free game quicker. If I wanted to pay to play this game then I would have gone and bought one of the many other hidden object games. No, I don't have much time in this game, so this review won't have much weight. But I refuse to waste time in a game once it has lost my good will."
392970,New York Mysteries: High Voltage,"I like the difficulty level, just right. Can go at my own pace."
393150,The Dreamatorium of Dr. Magnus 2,"On the whole, I can't overly recommend this game. I found it was too quick to complete, the story was rather bland, and the female protagonist's voice acting was atrocious. As a puzzle game itself, it was fine, but it was let down by poor execution."
393170,Bit Shifter,   Early Access Review
393200,Bad Rats Show,"this game has the deepest lore i've ever seen, as a bad rats veteren myself i've found that they added more jokes and way more story. The content is the best i've ever seen, it is stuff full of content with hours of enjoyment. Forget ubisoft and EA, GET BAD RATS OR DIE BLACKY"

"
393350,Shu's Garden,"'Um......' that was the first thing I said after playing this game. It is really rather strange. The art is kinda cool and the music is sorta neat. But there are no instructions, guide lines or goals at all. I know thats really part of the point of the game, but there really isn't much to do in the game and it doesn't capture my attention at all. It's almost like they tried to do what Proteus did and make a kind of anti-game where there are no goals, no objectives, no story, no instructions, and nothing to do but look and listen. Proteus got away with this because there was a sence of wonder and mystery. It made you want to go explore and see the world. In this I couldn't find that element of wonder so I lost intrest very quickly. I'm not sure the game is worth $4.99 so I can't recomend it.  EDIT I liked the game but I didn't like it enough to justify the 5 bucks. (I'm keeping the original post unedited for posterity and laughs; you don't have to read it.)"

393460,Crazy Pixel Streaker,"Great party game with friends. Playing alone makes you remember your undying sadness and that your friends don't apreciate you enough to spend 10$ and remain your freinds. The gameplay is solid and challenging enough to give you a good run for your money, the story is awesomr (nuff' said), the music if pretty hot and the animations are fun and well done. Overall, great game!"
393530,Insanity Clicker,I have been playing this game for several hours now. How the majority of the time i have been grinding off the same boss watching TV just collecting money. there is a strong feeling of 'pay to way' here. but i cant complain too much since the game is free. if you nothing better to do it is a decient time killer.

393740,Synchrom,"I requested a refund 6 minutes after purchasing. It was unplayable, i would move my mouse and 1 second later the synchrom(or whatever) would move. The game requires you to move fast and that wasn't possible. I even got an achievement for losing the first level. ---------- Dell Inspiron 7559 OS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 10586) Processor: i7 6700HQ Quad Core @ 2.60Ghz  Memory: 8GB DDR3L RAM  Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M and Intel(R) HD Graphics 530 DirectX: Version 12  Storage: 500GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD and 1TB HDD Internet Speed: 40Mbps"

I don’t see anything related to what control use or not so sucks, I’ll get the refund.  Just wait for some update to see if this improves, it seemed a fun game and shouldn’t had any issues like this"
393920,Auto Dealership Tycoon,"Disappointing. I do like a good tycoon game though, and I wish I'd have followed the other comments advising not to bother with the game. It's quite poor. Just a constant loop of music with no other sounds. You can barely sell cars, even though I set them at the dealer price, they still didn't sell!!! Your rating just slowly goes down also. The game tells you were to click, but it isn't very obvious. After, literally 30 minutes, I felt like I'd done all I needed to (and could really do) in the game.    I'd like to say 'You get what you pay for' but I've played FREE games on my iPhone better than this one and I've spent a lot longer time on.  GTA San Andreas is on the app store for the same price, so when you think about it, this really should be a free game..... or at least 69p or something. But £4.99..... though I guess I and others were stupid enough to go for it...   This game is also very amuterish and if someone told me it was made in 1995, I'd have believed them."

And I said 'I really wish there was a co-op game with triangles, squares, circles that shot triangles, worms that shot homing triangles, squares that roamed randomly, and ninja star shaped figures that liked you but didn't liked to be shot at and had acid like colors with a sweet high energy trance soundtrack. We're Only mean to children because we are deprived of such a game.'  I am no longer licking childrens tears. 10/10"

394130,Water Bears VR,"Adorable and fun! After all the scary and intense VR games out there, this is the perfect game to unwind with! The Waterbears are so cute you can spend hours just tickling their bellies and playing with them! The puzzles get more challenging as you go and its fun to build the pipes like legos. I only wish there were more levels to play! Fun for all ages and even the most manly man won't be able to resist this much cuteness!"

394160,ARCADE GAME SERIES: PAC-MAN,"It might be better on a console.  + It looks good - The sound is distorted while playing.  - The keyboard seems slow to respond. - There's no mouse support for the menus. - There's no way to quit apart from hiutting the window close button, which forgets settings changes"
394220,Last Horizon,"I love looking at the specials Steam has because you never know what you'll find.. this time for me was Last Horizon! When I first started playing I thought wow.. I've just wasted money but the more I played I found myself drawn to playing more.. How much further could I get? Could I get to my destination world? (No, I still haven't) but that's what makes Last Horizon interesting and fun.. trying to beat this game has become a quest for me. Do I wish they'd update it and add a few things? Sure.. It'd be nice to see how you did compared to others.. gravity could be nice to help you land easier on planets rather that flying by them when you're in desperate need of oxygen.. although it was cool in my last game I was about to die.. running out of oxygen and instead of dying my ship landed.. and the game continued! Found myself smiling which is what I would want to know if I had developed a game is that people did smile.. did try to keep going to get to the end of the game.. and people buying the game should inspire the developer to add more content.. 'cause the game in its own weird little way is just cool! Will everyone like it? Who knows but it's worth the cost I believe.. but like anything if you don't try.. or just give up.. you'll probably never know the intent of the developer.."

394280,Dark Heritage: Guardians of Hope,I was liking this a lot because it felt as much like a very old fashioned adventure game and its feel was different from other HOGs I have played. But its early on if you do things out of order you get stuck; this is a bug not a feature. I am will NOT follow a walkthrough to do things in the proper order not to get stuck - thats not the purpose of playing a game.

394310,Punch Club,"Punch Club has a interesting concept, what if you were the protagonist of an 80s B-movie fighting film, but also a management game?! Sadly, it doesn't quite work, and it's almost entirely down to the management game aspects. -Generally, it's too punishing. The start of the game is a horrible balance between getting food to eat and go to the gym, going to the gym to get super buff and then also sleeping and eating so you can go to the gym and also work to get money. However you'll also be too weak to really ever win any fight so you can't even try and get a major surpluss of money as you'll get mugged and while you can try and fight your way out of it, it's literally the fight you lose at the start of the game again and you've probably not progressed very far in your buffness. -You may have spent an entire day training and gotten vaguely stronger, just getting into the next strength level for a stat, but then you need to eat, sleep and get money to eat and sleep during which you get end of day decay happen and suddenly you've fallen once again down a power level. It's a constant fight between gaining say 50 points in one day, but then over the next three losing 30 points. It's a slow and unruly grind. -The fights themselves are possibly the worst aspect as you pick which moves you want to use, your best moves (why would you pick anything else?), and then sit and watch the two sprites punch one another for about 10 minutes until one of you falls down. That's it. Heck, I've even had fights where I've gotten someone down to 3 HP while still being on full and still somehow losing because the AI fighters always seem to have such wild stamina regen that even when they're on the ropes you'll suddenly find yourself unable to do anything but lose. Seriously, they're slow and monotonous and you do literally nothing but press a button every minute or so to start the next round. -The story tries its hardest to be an 80s B-movie, even with bear fighting scene and ninjas, and while it's super quirky oh-my-goodness-it's-so-bad it's also generally bad. The ending is just a smash cut to credits after a Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back-esque reveal and that's it.  The game is basically long, tedious and not very fun. The management aspects of it are very limited but also incredibly punishing for something which basically involves clicking on something and then sitting down for a bit as you contemplate your life. It's probably easier and more fun to get punched in the ACTUAL face. (More  here  [mozillogames.tumblr.com] )"

394550,Gunman Clive 2,"Very fun. I think I had more fun with 2 than the first, I also really liked the 3d levels. Though with 2 I ran into more problems with compatibility. I felt like through the entire game i was contantly dropping to 20-25 frames even with low filtering, and im sure this is with the game itself. Other than that, a great sequel to the first one."
394600,Mighty Gunvolt,"Mighty Gunvolt is a cute, short Mega-Man style platformer but nothing special makes it stand out. It's more or less a promotion for Azure Striker Gunvolt and Might No 9.

394720,The Legend of Tango,"It misses the mark in almost every respect. The story is trying to make certain metaphor points, but falls short with how bad every line lands. Gameplay....you can barely say it exists, but would be better without it. Even the level design is bad with how poorly obvious everything is that it gives no sense of reward and treats you like a complete moron."
394760,Dead Effect 2,"this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, had a blast playing it, since i enjoyed the first one, i thought i might as well buy the sequel. This one has soo much more content and even once you beat the main story mode, there are soo much more to do after you finished."
394770,Owys,'A lot you die' Yoda in the year 36 after the Great ReSynchronization
394840,Mars Colony: Frontier,"I thought that this game would be good, but I was wrong. The controls are hard to get used to, including the fact that I have to hold on the right mouse button to change where my character is looking. Changing keybindings is also quite hard to do as actions can have multiple keys assigned with no visible designation of which key is the primary one and which is the secondary key for that action.   I also found that the graphics are OK, but it is quite wierd seening NPCs around that all appear shorter than the character. To me, this doens't help, because the player can look over NPCs. As well as these, I find it a bit disturbing that NPCs are in the smae position and the player's character cannot interact with them."
394850,Square Brawl,"This is the first time sence Super Smash Bros That I have truly enjoyed a game like this, best with others and is amazing if you have a HTPC or you can get it into a console setup type deal it would also work good for parties."
394870,Office Battle,"The first thing I noticed in the game was that you can't turn by moving your mouse. You have to move in the direction you want to face, and even that is slow. I would see my character running into a wall, slowly turning to the doorway as I was pressing keys to make him move in that direction.  And by the way, I was crafting badges, and I got a coupon for this, which is why I even got it in the first place. Forget having many games or another badge."
394970,DEADBOLT,"Imagine, for a second of Gunpoint and Hotline Miami had a baby, only Gunpoint was seeing Not a Hero on the Side and got a little of its structure thrown into the mix, then the baby came out with a gothic horror inspired skin. That's pretty much what you get with Deadbolt.  You are a Reaper. Your job is to eliminate a recent undead uprising, and only a few levels in, you discover the undead are using a new drug called Ash, which makes them feel alive. You are given increasingly more challenging missions from The Flame- literally a fireplace that talks to you. You work your way through the ranks, from low level zombies to mid level vampires, to even more that I won't spoil.  Even though you're a reaper, you're extremely vulnerable. Like, one hit from just about any weapon at all will kill you and send you back to the beginning of the level. This, and the gore are where the Hotline Miami genes come in. You can play recklessly thanks to the ease with which the game respawns you. The Gunpoint comes from the fact that you can be stealthy. Not only are shadows your best friends since they make it much more difficult for enemies to see you, but you can turn into smoke and travel through any given ventilation system. Each mission has a different objective, but generally speaking you'll be killing everything you can.  This is, obviously, a very different game than Hopoo game's previous work, the stellar Risk of Rain, which is an absolute blast to play solo or co op. This game only shows that the developers know what they're doing and can design many different kinds of games- which, personally, has me excited for whatever their next project is. All the mechanics in the game are fine tuned so that when you screw up and die, it's almost always your fault (although the AI will sometimes behave unpredictably and that can lead to a death that feels cheap). The level design is absolutely top notch. The game looks great. It sounds great. It plays great.  My only complaint with it is that the story is woefully under written. You're thrown into this situation with little in the way of exposition. I understand that being cryptic helps the atmosphere, but I would have liked to know a bit more of the lore behind the world. It's clear that it's there, it's just tough to piece out, which leads to an ending that feels a bit anti climactic from a story perspective.  But that shouldn't hold you back from playing this terrific game. If you're a fan of Hotline Miami, Gunpoint, Not a Hero, or just gothic horror in general, this absolutely needs to be on your must play list."
394990,Habitus,"I have waited for the game. The game came. I were happy. I really love this game, I like the artstyle ,I like the survival aspect and the difficulty is really good. I can only say: It is a really good game.  Ich habe auf dieses Spiel gewartet. Das Spiel kam. Ich war glücklich.

If you are a fan of Super Meat Boy and/or like biology, please do yourself a favor and buy this game! Mechanics are tight, levels are well designed and varied so that the game play doesn't get boring. I'm about half way through after 3 hours of play time so it isn't a super long game, but there is a level score that promotes mastery which will keep you busy for hours after completion I'm sure. It's under $8 (two Starbucks coffees) and is a super fun game, buy it!"

395150,Dark Storm VR Missions , Early Access Review
395160,Toby: The Secret Mine,"The game looks great, no doubt about that. The graphics makes me think of Limbo and Badland. The gameplay makes you think of Limbo, but with more traps, but that is where the good ends. The game features almost no real puzzles. The controls feel clunky. The runspeed feels to slow and you always jump the same height, no matter if you release the jump button or hold it in. The myriad of traps sometimes require you to die on them to know they are there, which becomes tedious after a while. You never get a sense that you are exploring, rather just avoiding whatever trap is currently on the screen. The game is short and mostly too easy. The hardest part is probably the last level, because the enemies flinging bombs seem very random, so it's just try until you make it. Halfway through I was bored, but I continued on anyway. An underwhelming experience, to say the least."
395170,DISTRAINT: Deluxe Edition,Great game
395190,Reiner Knizia's The Confrontation,"This is a really great conversion of a board game. I supported it on Kickstarter and I'm happy with the final product. Mac version seems solid and the introductory tutorial is well done (usually tutorials suck on most board game conversions). Animations and game mechanics all feel very well polished. Kind of wish the game had a campaign mode with a story, but fighting the AI in solo mode works too I guess. Could also use a bit more settings to adjust the resolution and windowed in-game, but can also hope those come in a later patch."
39520,The Guild Gold Edition,"Great management game, Hands down one of the best games I've ever played."

Self-censored to avoid spoilers or any content whatsoever!!
39530,Painkiller: Black Edition,"I was looking for something similar as Serious Sam so I gave it a try but I was pretty much dissapointed.  - boring level design and short levels - boring weapons - anoying enemies, bosses - its just mindless kiling - alt attacks sucks"
395300,Voxel Blast,"Looking at my play time, it doesn't seem a lot, and it isn't a lot, but it'll increase over time, because I did enjoy the game.  It's a more abstract 3D Dogfighting game with all kinds of interesting and strange enemies. You can also unlock different ships for yourself to play.  Every ship plays differently and has different weapons.  I played it with a Joystick / Flight Stick and it works fine, although I'd love to be able to 'side-step' so-to-speak, but that isn't much of an issue by the time you get used to the controls.  Sound design seemed a bit basic.  I'd say, if you like the look of this game, then definitely give it a spin!   My preview of Voxel Blast:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id4ff1joK6Y "
395350,Doors,"It's amisunderstanding of a game. Not that it's terrible, but compared to competition, it should be free.  Also, the trailer of this game is awesome. This is how you sell crappy stuff - put all best bits into the trailer and make them look better than they do in the actual game."
395380,ANKI,"Interesting game, fast to download. Cute artwork."
39540,SpellForce: Platinum Edition,"Played this game back in the days on Windows XP and absolutely loved it! Great and easy gameplay, great combination of roleplay and strategy (Skyrim meets Stronghold), enjoyable quests, satisfying options to customize your character and their skillsets. The freedom in the customization actually inspired a lot of my rpg characters and brought original characters to life for the first time.  When I saw the Platinum Edition here on steam I immediately knew I had to get it since my original discs aren't working on Windows 8 anymore. So for anyone wondering: The steam download version works perfectly fine on Windows 8! ;)  Graphics obviously aren't up-to-date anymore but I still absolutely adore this game and enjoy getting into it now just as much as 14 years ago, while impatiently waiting for the release of SpellForce 3 later this year."
395400,Freedom Cry,"PROS: It was on sale?  CONS: I still had to pay for it...  Seriously:  The story makes little sense.  The characters make even less sense.  There is way too much dialogue that mentions things from the real world (as jokes) but takes away from the game rather than adding to it.  The 'pathing' is annoying at best with some stairs being unusable for no apparent reason, the ability to skip large sections of maps because you can just walk out of bounds, walls that you can walk into just because the is an object placed there, a bridge that can only be taken in one direction (again, no apparent reason) and a world map that suffers some of the previous problems.  And their constant misuse of the word then when they really meant than (every freakin' time!).   This game is not worth buying."
395420,The Dwarf Run,"if you are looking for a fun game this is not it ! I like to play games I can beat in easy mode if I want to . even the easiest mode on this game is nearly impossible. where is the store to buy more arrows , where is the boulders to replenish what you have used . The magic cant be used over and over . The monsters should be easier to defeat in the leisure mode . If this is what you call easy I dont think I will be playing it any longer . Make it hard in Hard mode . NOT LEISURE. make supplies available . This game is not for easy playing its for hardcore players only."
395470,ICARUS.1,"A nice little sci-fi game, with a story told mainly through text logs. I love the low-poly style and the music.   A rogue AI is a pretty played out sci-fi trope, but it drives the story well enough.    Nitpicks: The controls feel very floaty and slow to respond, which is probably just a consequence of the game engine. This isn't an action game, but there are environmental hazards and jumping puzzles which are made more difficult by 'movement ease' and 'smooth look'. I highly recommend turning those off in player settings (which is only accessible from the in-game pause menu, not the title screen; weird).  The grey-and-yellow color scheme works well for an industrial spacecraft feel, but this color scheme extends to pretty much everything. This makes some important interactive switches and panels quite difficult to find. If I were designing a spacecraft, I'd highlight important maintenance hatches and levers and whatnot with bright colors so they're easy for the crew to find in an emergency.  Many levels are quite dark. It makes sense for a stranded spacecraft with limited power, but the only way you have to light things up is a limited number of emergency flares (which don't carry over between chapters, by the way). Once you're out of flares, you get to stumble around in the dark, which I guess adds to the atmosphere, but... aren't I in a spacesuit? Why don't I have some kind of built-in flashlight?  I'm all for nonlinear level design, but what I'm not for is nonlinear level design with unmarked points of no return. Too many times, the game would quietly close a door behind me, preventing me from fully exploring a level. This eventually made me hesitant to go down any hallway, as I had no idea if I'd be able to return or not.  It's often not clear what effect flipping a switch had on the level. Sometimes controls are quite far removed from the thing they actually control (which doesn't really make sense from a spacecraft design perspective). And sometimes the control placement just makes no sense at all in-universe, like   the switch to lift the second clamp in the last chapter being on the backside of one of the traps you run through. Who put that switch there? Why would you design a ship like that?   So when you flip a switch, you then get to explore the entire level again to figure out what the switch did. Combined with the previous point, there were a couple times I flipped a switch and never found out what it did, because I accidentally walked past an invisible point of no return."
395480,The Makeshifter,   Early Access Review
39550,SpellForce 2 - Anniversary Edition,This game is total garbage. Just reminds me of a lackluster Warcraft with worse graphics though. No resolution support for widescreens.   WARNING: Game does not have any graphics you are viewing as part of the screen shots and trailer. It is another game altogether. I am also sure that the 80% rating has been tampered with. I tried to get a refund as this software isn't the same as the game description. It was a huge mistake purchasing this counterfeit software.
395500,Rot Gut,It's alright. Not a bad way to kill an hour for two bucks.
395520,Missing Translation,"Very interesting game with unique puzzles. I couldn't play for long because the patterns really strained my eyes, but I have really awful eyes so I'm still going to recommend this. It's free so why not give it a shot?"
395560,Lost Horizon 2,"Loved the first game. The orriginal felt very cinematic, was well written, nice graphics, good dialogue, 60 NPCs.... This on the other hand... Well... It feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized port of a game that was built to put on the iphone. But then again this is par for the course in any Animation Arts series. For Example, Segrect Files: Tanguska was pure genius. Then Secret Files 2 came out, it was alright, but clearly suffered from being a sequel. Secret Files 3... Well lets just say that someone flung some poo at a fan here and signalled a death spiral for that series. And don't even get me started on Sam Peters, but needless to say, travesty, and wanting ill will towards the developers would be putting things lightly.  So actually, I guess that means that Animation Arts got better... at failure and killing a series faster? Why waste killing a promising IP over 4 games, when only 2 will do. Right? "
395570,"!""We Are The Dwarves""!","When WatD first released I offered up a fairly scathing review; two patches and a half dozen game hours later I am returning to offer my second opinion.  First off I would like to say that I don't enjoy WatD whatsoever... Mind you this is not due to a fault of the game, though it does have it's share of faults which I will cover below, but rather due to my misconception of what I imagined the game to be based on early trailers. It is easy to look at the isometric view in combination with it's seamingly fast paced combat and character classes shown in the the trailer and immediately think of something along the lines of a Diablo-like with a pause feature that allows you to que up attacks and strategize; the truth is that WatD couldn't be further from a rogue-like dungeon crawler despite it's appearance and is actually an RTT (Real-Time-Tactics) with an active pause system that strongly resembles Dragon Age Inquisition's tactical view. This has lead me to greatly dislike WatD; not because I think the game is bad, but because I do not enjoy the genre.  With that said, there is a lot of positive aspects to the game; it's lore, concept, and visual representations are all worthy of praise. The inverted universe that Whale Rock has created is truly an amazing concept, and how it links sci-fi and fantasy to offer an all new and unique setting/concept is really WatD's strong suit; this setting is complimented quite well by the stylistic, colorful, and beautifully rendered environments and some truly impressive lighting that brings it all to life.  Where WatD loses me though is it's gameplay... Part of this is due to not liking the genre, but part of it is also due to frustrating difficulty spikes, issues with control resposiveness, player movement pathing, somewhat unblanced enemy AI and mechanics, and lackluster classes each on of which I would like to talk about in a little detail since I feel most of the reviews on here haven't actually talked about the game and resort to 'It's brutally hard, which makes it great!'  First I want to talk about difficulty. Now, normally I like difficult games, in fact I am a glutton for punishment, but I am not fond of games that have inconsistent difficulty spikes; for example one part of a stage will seem like a reasonable challenge, while another part will immediately seem to be almost impossible; for example one room in a stage might be relatively simple and only require 1-3 retries while the next will have you reloading your save 20-30 times just to find a strategy that doesn't get you outright killed instantly. Moments like this feel like pulling teeth as you try and rack your mind for a solution that should work only to realize it will fail because you wrongly predicted how an enemy would react or a mechanic failed to work the way you expected and the margin for error is so low that the simplest of mistakes can mean death. These are the moments that have made me consider outright quitting on several occassions.  Secondly there is the camera control, or lack of control since there is only an option to rotate around a fixed angle. I can't count how many times I wished I could freely pan the camera to get a better look at the mape and see where enemies/items are or tilt the camera down a bit to see what's directly in front of me. Beyond the lack of camera control it is also worth noting that there is no foreground transparency for environmental objects, this often means that you will find yourself with objects blocking your view from multiple angles and in some cases making it almost impossible to see what is around you at any time. Personally I would really like to see the camera moved away from RMB to rotate to something closer to XCOM's WASD to pan with Q/E to rotate, this would make controlling the camera and navigating the world outside of the active pause significantlty easier.  As a sidenote to controls player movement pathing also needs some work, one of the things that is quickly apparent in WatD is that your movement is incredibly important; staying in cover, avoiding enemy paths, sneaking past environemtal traps, etc... all of these things are necessary for your survival which is what makes the clunky click to move system a little bit frustating. I've found many occasions where I will click a location and watch my Dwarf take the worst possible path to it, or worse instances where I am controlling multiple Dwarves and one takes the safe route while the other runs straight through a camp of enemies and into a trap (or two) before reaching their destination. It's annoying and often makes me wish I had a much more accurate control of my movements.  Then there are the enemies, which often feel way too fast or at times down right omnicient... One of the first things you will notice when you start playing is that your dwarves are significantly slower than most of the game's enemies, so much so that some enemies are actually impossible to target with specific dwarves, and there is nothing more frustrating than lining up and planning an attack only to realize that when it occurs the enemy you targeted is now 5-10 feet away from where they were when you started the attack. The absolute worst part of WatD's enemies is how the AI is encoded to immediately know exactly where to search for the player once they have been alerted though, even if circumstances should have made the player impossible to track. You were in cover, on the other side of the map, using an ability that mutes your actions when you fired an arrow? Guess what, as soon as enemies find the body they will know exactly where you were, and if you've moved they will be able to immediately track you to your new location. What makes this worse is that you can't do anything at all while enemies are searching for you, including saving or upgrading your character at save points or leaving the level through it's exit, and enemy AI will aggressively track you until it finds you once you've alerted them; this is by far the one aspect of the game that feels brutally unfair.  Mind you, dealing with difficult enemies in droves probably wouldn't be too hard if the dwarves themselves didn't appear to be the worst possible versions of fantasy video game tropes, you have: Forcer the ranger who's shotgun has a range roughly half that of all the games ranged enmies, Smashfist the tank/berserker who needs to be nearly dead to use his tank ability and pushes enemies away just as much as he draws them in, and Shadow the stealthy rogue who alerts just about every enemy on the map with each of his actions. Half of the abilites are either incredibly situational or require several upgrades to function with any efficiency while other abilities are pretty much useless, like Forcer's decoy which enemies seem to largely ignore or Smashfist's stone skin which is hardly ever available for activation since his 'fury' meter rapidly drains all the time even when in battle. The result is that your dwarves often feel ill equipt for the situation they are in, and frankly pretty bad at each of their roles which can be a bit annoying...  With everything said I will say that We are the Dwarves is not a bad game, in fact it is far from it, but at the same time it is not the game I wanted or expected it to be which frankly is my problem not the game's. If you are a fan of RTT games and are looking for one that will challenge you then chances are you will be quite happy with WatD, but if you were looking for anything other than that chances are it is not for you..."
395580,Inventioneers,  Inventioneers - A Steam Review
39560,Painkiller: Resurrection,My very first game that i have not finished.. A tragic game from all aspects... Just uninstall it!
395600,Armor Clash,"Look, this ONE guy created this and I have t say it's pretty good for ONE guy making it. One this I would suggest is to lower the price a bit to maybe $10 and add mouse scrolling! Also, maybe put in a menu where you can edit the in game options! Given that it's $20 I have to not recommend it until the price drops. I really cannot play this given that I am so used to the mouse scroll to the edge to move aorund mechanic."
395620,Ittle Dew 2+,"Such a disappointment. If I want to play such hard combat I have Dark Souls. I cannot even check out the puzzles when you get killed every 2 minutes and need to walk from the start of the dungeon. The graphics and animations are great, the sound is awesome, but the game isn't what it should have been. If you played Ittle Dew 1 and hope for puzzle game with some combat - skip this one. I hope the developers make ID3 right because I'm not buying it if it turns out like this one."

395850,Bear Simulator,"My boyfriend bought me this as a gift...and I was kind of digging the game. I mean, I constantly make jokes about being a bear, and I got a Top Bear hat! How cool is that!  However I'm requesting a refund through steam now because I'm very disappointed that this game will not continue to get updates. For 15 dollars I expect a little more care, and I bought it because I was under the impression there would be more updates.   Unfortunately developer can't take bad reviews, and I can't deal with bad developers. :c"
395860,The Last Dream: Developer's Edition,"Fun game, vert well delivered, not overly difficult. More should be made like this"
395890,Lapland Solitaire,the game is solitaire just as it sounds card game with a christmas theme help build santas work shop by beating the levels.  the game is nothing special. the sucky part is its all luck of the draw and you beating a level with stars on the first try is low really low like 10% check these videos out and see for your self.   https://youtu.be/3XEbqfU9y0c    https://youtu.be/mKCRnkz9oQA    https://youtu.be/S8QmKeeK7SU    https://youtu.be/fZlirkEelJk   the game could be fun if you didint take you forever to get a star on one level but you have to redo and redo its all luck of the draw.
395900,Backgammon Blitz,"Well, AI is really low. I mean, you can't lose even at highest level. Visiuals and sounds quite nice, had nice design. AI is not that important when it comes to play online with real players, however, there arent any lobbies with online players to play. I bought the game yesterday and couldnt find any player except myself. No, I don't recommend this game even for 1$. Because there are no players except the AI and the AI is just awful. Sorry but seems like developers just want to find some easy money. Your and my money. Stay away from this game."
395910,Get Rich or Die Gaming,"  Awful, most of the pictures arnt accessible. Even though it was gifted to me, It feels embarrasing just having it in my library. Don't know why I don't delete it, though."
395920,Playing History - The Plague,"£2.79? For the best point-n-click adventure ever made? So immersive, so edumacational! Hours and hours of adventuring fun - as long as you don't follow the prompts &amp; complete the game in ten minutes.  10/10 will never play again..."
3960,Shattered Union,Got this game working with the work-around others mentioned but now it crashes every time I try to attack the last region on the map...what's the point of a game you can't finish?
396010,The Rise of Chubtan,"The Rise of Chubtan gives eager players another excuse to let out their aggression on friends in a local deathmatch game. While the Mayan setting stands out, the foretold apocalypse must not have been caused by too much in-game content. Chubtan doesn’t rise so much as he kind of just leans up.   The objective in Chubtan is to use your palette swap character to hit the switch in the arena as many times as possible, with each hit changing the switch’s location and activating a trap, to build up your score before time runs out. Players can punch for knock back or send out a projectile with a brief stun, both of which won’t directly kill your opponent but rather help to manipulate them into traps. The focus of the game is less about killing and more about score, and some of the traps are more likely to punish careless players than be used for murder.  The traps demand blood and will continue firing and resetting until someone is killed. Players die instantly from traps, and there are a few pickups that spawn on each map that can offer small boosts like speed or invincibility. Traps can stack on each other with each switch hit, which can make it an interesting game of survival as chaos erupts. There are currently 4 maps each with a handful of traps exclusive to each that range from acid covering the floor to a robot firing lasers. The frenzy of matches can be fun and exciting, but Chubtan definitely hits a wall.  Chubtan has one game mode, the option to change the time limit, and requires human players. There are no co-op modes or bot options. The fact that all 4 players can play on the same keyboard with moderate comfort does soften the blow, and the devs have stated that they are willing to add an online option if people show interest. Given the rather low amount of content, online play would certainly be a step in the right direction, but Duck Game, Fighties and Brawlhalla already offer solid online play in addition to them being polished and interesting.  There is not something that really grabs players here. Chubtan does not have much going on in terms of style. The gameplay does not feel quite snappy or dynamic enough. At the same time, this isn’t as easy to pick up and play as other options: some more unskilled players will find themselves dying constantly from traps and having a hard time trying to maneuver around platforms. Mechanics wise, a dash or counter would help make matches livelier, movement speed could be a pinch faster, and arenas could use more space because at the moment players are mostly tripping through traps rather than besting each other with skill. The lack of variety between matches also adds to this with limited options and modifiers. There is not a strong hook here; it’s a simple idea played mildly.   On a technical level, Chubtan is functional and it can be fun. But, with all the other options to choose from, Chubtan is just a game to hold you over in between bouts of Towerfall or Crawl. So far Chubtan is so bland and bare that it is the Communion wafer of local multiplayer options. By no means is it horrible or broken, but unless it gets a substantial update, it’s also not appealing."
396030,InCell VR,"I played this with the Rift and was almost immediately motion sick.  It's hard to tell if this is intentional or just a bug with the game, but there was no way to go straight. I was either spinning full speed left or right. I had to stop playing and can't imagine I'll ever run this again."
396060,The Rose and I,"Very touching, excellent graphics, elegant story, a go-to to demo VR. Worthy of a fee, but its generously free.  I'm sad to report that since a Dec. 8th update, this wonderful experience no longer plays for many of the users, myself included. It's been reported, but so far there's no word from Penrose."
396090,Rogue State,I somehow managed to upset both the religious fundamentalists and the liberals. I wasn't even made when they blew my Escalade up after getting that right.  
396160,Secret Of Magia,"Received a key for this in a bundle. I didn't expect much, but still felt let down. Very poorly balanced and basic Zelda-esque game. There's no sense of life in the game world, no motivation to follow the plot, and very little joy to be found in the actual gameplay. I played just long enough to get 100% achievements (which can be done in 5 minutes if you follow a Youtube guide) then uninstalled. Not worth your time or money, even at 19p which is the current sale price; there's plenty of better games out there."
396230,VERSUS: The Lost Ones,Great reading and interacting! A living universe full of surprises. Not to miss!
39630,AquaNox,I found this game really hard to masturbate to.
396310,Masochisia,"This game is a scary, psychological challenge, this is why i bought it. But there are som stupid things about it.  Positive: Nice art, the dialogues really sound like its coming from a person suffering with schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder. The art is nice, the music as well, and the character design is rough and sketchy. Backgrounds are creepy, and honestly, i havent gotten much further so if you will please just drop down to the second part of this review...  Negative: There you are. First of all, I did not expect this game to be so stiff. You can only move the picture either left or right, which kinda sucks and limits you from moving, and gives you a feeling that you are 'stuck'. I would have prefered this game to be 2D mixed with 3D or something more movable than this slideshow. Second of all, its WAY to cryptic. There is a shed where you are supposed to open a hatch, but theres a 4 digit code on it, and you cant use any tools in the shed to break it open (Please learn from Life is Strange) you MUST get this 4 digit code, and the only way to do that is to dig even deeper into the schizophrenic psychopath you are, and oh, did i forget to mention that as you play along, scary bears and shady people show up who tell you wierd stuff that makes absolutely no sense? Yes, its one of those games which can only be explained through a very VERY heavy interpretation of your own mind. No, im kidding, but its ridiculous... The answers that you can choose from during a dialogue is almost as ♥♥♥♥ed and twisted as the person asking them, specially since the persons you meet are either faceless girls, odd young boys with no pupils or big, red eyes satanists who have crosses in ther faces. Im stuck at the shed trying to open the hatch, but when you ask your mom (Btw, your mom is a sick twisted ♥♥♥♥ , and your father is a sadistic psychopathic drunk who beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and than has a personal dialogue with God) . Eitherhow, there is nothing clear in this game. Ever once in a while trying to find clues you go into this psycho-mode where your heart beat rate, and all of a sudden, you have scary creatures coming up close to your screen, screaming, and you do kinda get scared, but when you take the pills (yes you infinite amount of pills) you turn back to 'normal'. Sometimes the game goes back to 'reality' and you are some dude named Alfred sitting in a hospital with a shrink. In the 'other' reality your name is Hamilton. Anyway, on the game,your mom wont give the combination to the hatch, saying that 'time will tell', what the ♥♥♥♥ does that even mean? Trying to scout every pixel of the game leads to no where, except this other voice keeps telling you cant go to certain places, despite that im ♥♥♥♥ing armed with 2 knifes. In the house you live in you got a neighbor or a brother or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he is, who is tied and has a mask on his face. Trying to ask him to help you results in him saying 'Im gonna eat your ♥♥♥♥ing heart out' and if you try to talk to him again, he just laughs.  This whole game is hard and its ♥♥♥♥ing wierd. And why the ♥♥♥♥ are there no voices? Reading text is boring.  The music is nice, the art, the characters, but the story is BORING and it makes no sense. Its way to cryptic, and the whole left-right slideshow controll is boring.  I give this game 6/10."
396320,Tank Battle: 1944,"I wanted to like this game, but the glitchy UI is endlessly frustrating. Very often you will attempt to select a unit and the game will decide that instead you wanted to immediately and jarringly jump to the other side of the map. Do not buy this game, even on sale."
396360,LocoSoccer,great game if you are looking for a football simulator thisi s definteyly the best chocuhe no doubt
396420,The Spookening,I created a first look video for this game. If you want to see some gameplay click here!         YouTube™ Video:  The Spookening First Look HD&nbsp;
396480,Battlevoid: Harbinger,"I've seen this game being compared to FTL so i was curious and decided to check it out. While it's a decent little rogue-lite in space - it's nothing compared to FTL. The combat is dull and you have very little control over it, weapon options are very limited and upgrades feel like they are not very meaningful while very expensive. It has levels system which unlocks new ships to fly, but you get such small amounts of experience that you will need tenths of hours to unlock them and i can't see why you would play this game for so long. Both times i had some meaningful progress i got screwed by rng, when you warp into the next sector your warp is on cooldown and while you can control where you land - you can't account in the late warps of the enemy ships so both times 4 ships just suddenly warped on top of mine and there's literally nothing you can do but to pray that you will kill them before they kill you, a couple of times i got lucky, but those 2 times i wasn't.  It's worth a couple of hours of playtime with a heavy discount, otherwise avoid this game."
39650,The Guild II,"It seems like it would be a cool game, but unfortunately it's so glitchy I'm having trouble even making it through the tutorial! :("
396530,Fireflies,"  The developer for this game lost their game assets and sold the game to someone else. I played it for about 30 minutes and while I thought the sound design was pretty good, it's just an incomplete game. The world feels very empty and there's graphic glitches abound. I couldn't get much from the story either as it was very clear on how to progress.  I did a review/gameplay video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ausA8vednog "
396590,CMYW,Pretty goood
39660,The Guild II - Pirates of the European Seas,"There is nothing more you need to say. If you like the main game, you gonna like this dlc too."
396610,Quantum Flux,"Quantum Flux is Oregon Trail in space, except with worse graphics. At least Oregon Trail had decent graphics for the time and the revamps have maintained the aesthetic.   So you're in charge of a wagon train/space ship/whatever full of colonistcicles, flying to a new planet and banging your head against popup encounters, making decisions that invariably kill your crew, damage your ship and take away all your money.  So why is Quantum flux so bad when Oregon Trail wasn't?  * It doesn't have any particularly interesting gameplay over Oregon Trail * The artwork is so low effort it's painful - fonts are mismatched, art assets are bad for the 1990s * Technical low effort junk - It's clearly a tablet/mobile port, and what's absurd - you can't even switch to fullscreen. Windowed mode only!  The laziness and low quality in this game is painful. You can play OT online for free. There are better web browser games. The developer has no justification to put this on the Steam store and ask for money for it."
396640,TowerClimb,"Bought and installed the game with the intention of playing coop with my brother. After trying to figure out the settings and realizing they were horribly dysfunctional, we could not figure out how to get coop to work. The settings were atrocious and impossible to work with. Haven't even played the game but can't even get it to go fullscreen with the proper resolution and it looks horrible the way it is right now. Pass."
396650,ACE Academy,This was the first Visual Novel i have ever played i can say with out a doubt I would not have chosen anything else after playing this.The Characters are amazing and the fights actually give you input.the story is compelling.I just don't know how to express how good this game was.But I just hope the come out with a sequel soon.
396660,Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire,"The good   This Game plays much like the Banner saga, it is chalenging turn based combat that can bea veary engaging.   its Native stile is engaging and create a rich world as a back drop Price is not Bad   The bad   The Game abruptly ends, right as the game feels like its hitting its stride with little Epilogue or story wrap up, if they do a sequel this is a good ending for chapter 1  Very short finished it in under 10 hours   over all it was Fun, But Short. Hopfuly this is just the first chapter in a much larger Nartive"
39670,Chaser,"Yeah...I don't recommend this game. The gameplay is very repetitive, the graphics dated and lacking a decent aesthetic, the voice-acting woeful (especially from the main character), and the story, while it has a kind-of-but-not-really interesting twist at the end, isn't told very well (and only through cut-scenes). The only good moments involve running through an airport (sorry, spaceport) unarmed escaping guards, and one where you're in a mech suit. The rest is 'Go down the corridor, shoot the guy with the boring weapon'."
396750,EVERSPACE™, Early Access Review
396790,Dracula's Legacy,Another classic click and point game with hidden object challenges. I was disappointed there were not many hidden object screens but the game is a good length and not too long or too short. Overall there were some plot holes and a few things left unexplained which made my eye twitch.
39680,The Guild II: Renaissance,"I really enjoy this game, I was surprised by how much I liked it once I got into it. has quite a steep learning curve at first as it does not really tell you how to play. however, the forums were very useful and people were a great help.  Once i got the hang of the game it is super fun setting up your businesses, then collecting the raw resources to craft your items cheaper then your competitors so you can run them out of business.  the politics side of the game was not really interesting to me, but building a network of businesses and carts running resources between them to build up my empire was definitely entertaining for hours.   Looking forward to The Guild 3"
396800,12 Labours of Hercules IV: Mother Nature,"Boy, I sure do love doing the same thing over and over for every one of the 60+ levels. Not only that, it's the same exact thing you had to do in the last three games. So, that's like 200 levels of the exact same thing. It's all so easy with absolutely zero challenge, but for me, this is my last game of the series and when I'm done, I'll be done. Good riddance.  4/10  Only recommended if you like easy 100%s."
396820,Mass Destruction,"Gameplay didn't start. I can defins settings, controls and see main menu but when I starts a battle game only shows me demo gameplay video. Pressing any key retuns me to menu 'press X do start a game' and situation reoccurs.  Run in window or full screen, with compatibility mode or not. First game that didn't work on my genuine Windows 10 and probably it's not a OS issue."
396850,Chronicles of the Witches and Warlocks,I like good HOGs....and this is not one of them. The problem are not the riddles or the HOG....its just not logical. For most of the game I hit the hint button because I didn't know what the game wants next. The map is of not helping because it shows that there is an action available (even if you don't have the item yet).
396860,Over The Hills And Far Away,not a game .... it is simply a book
396870,Catyph: The Kunci Experiment,"I enjoyed this game, but I must admit I had to use the help now and again,'normal mode'.The logic circuits in my brain seem to be working fine but my observational skills are nil. You need both to get through this game without any help. This is a good game and has kept me interested and determined to finish it, which I have done! The different area's you visit are visually good and have to be investigated. I am looking forward to the next installment."
396890,Gridworld,This game sucks. This game isn't any fun at all.

397040,Sphere 3: Enchanted World,"The game is dead, nobody on the servers and never anyone new playing. This game had potential for a wow clone, unfortunately the numbers dwindling and lack of anything or anyone is a little disheartening. Still, would have made a decent game, but i gotta uninstall through lack of public interest."
397060,Faeria, Early Access Review
397090,Wind Child,"I can and can't recommend this game at once. I will begin with good sides of the game:  Story:  It's really fine, there are many threads you need to follow and the story itself is not straight-forward. You need to read dialogues to know what to do, as quest log is not updating frequently - which is a great positive. NPCs know about RPG system, including turns, ATB, equip and stuff like this. There are also many references to Final Fantasy series.  Soundtrack:  I always liked soundtracks in rpg maker games and this I really enjoyed this one, too. There weren't any annoying sounds or 'songs'. There are classic ( standard) rpgm clips and some outside ones.  Characters and graphic:  They are well developed, they don't suddenly do things that don't fit to their personalities. Graphic is really nice, maps and models are detailed and look really well.  Now bad sides of the game, that kind of counter what I've written above.  Tile problems:  This is game with most number of wrong tile options I've ever bought. You can literally skip half of the story by moving through walls or edges. That path is blocked, you need to find way around. Well, just move through walls to pass through - and then you realize that when you reach new zone, you have new character in party... That is not added, so you can pass the game without even meeting main characters. This problem is  game breaking , I really can't think that someone was actually testing it.  Gold system:  I understand game conception that is non-grind, but prices of items are both too high and too low. Bread costs 50 gold, while armor that allows you to play for really long time on god mode, costs only 300. ( it has so huge defend statistic that everything is hitting you for 0). To all of that, you find hidden treasure rooms that contains 100-250 gold, while fighting with low level animals ( even frogs) gives you 150.  Combat system:  Combat itself is ok, but speed of it way too slow. The fights in the game takes too much time overall. It's not a big problem, as it's all about getting used to it, but it's annoying. It would be much better with 'Rush' option.  Price:  The price of 4 euro is way too much for this game. If you see this on discount ( price less than 1,50 euro), then it's worth to buy, but overall - it's not.  If the game would get update fixing tiles, it would be really good game. For now, the problem is so huge, that it's breaking most of fun of playing it as well as destroying whole experience. Wait for patch - if it's ever gonna come!"

397190,Sengoku Jidai: Shadow of the Shogun,"Typical James Clavell/Creative Assembly fantasy bogus. Katana-wielding ashigaru all over the place. No bibliography in the manual but I'm sure it all comes from Osprey and Stephen Turnbull books. Compared to the relative accuracy of the historical scenarios in Pike and Shot, this was a big let down."

397210,Kanji Training Game,"Disclaimer: Not recommended for beginners, this is for students who are already invested and learning Japanese, and want a good memory game for remembering kanji.  Pros: Very good organization of Kanji, from most simple to more complex as you go on. Plays anxious music while you play, but it's good nonetheless.  Cons: Few typos in furigana and hiragana can teach lower-intermediate students to pronounce vocabulary the wrong way."

397270,A Kiss For The Petals - Remembering How We Met,A kiss for the petals is a very short linear visual novel with no choices about the Start of a lesbian relationship  relationship between two girls at a girls school known as Yuri in Japanese anime Wikipedia definition here       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_(genre)      . This visual novel Has a Romantic orientation rather than the Sexual orientation of the relationship between the two girls.     Their is no nudity or sexual content. Some mild sexual innuendo and text suggestion. Its What I would call a Japanese anime lesbian romantic comedy. I cant say That the work was not well done. It was very well done .   Its a cute visual novel .With some pretty interesting relationship dynamics. As well as some pretty clever word play . and double meanings It is for that reason that I am giving this a positive review .  from what I have read in the other positive reviews . Their is some sort of fan base and among connoisseur's of Yuri anime visual novels the 'saint Michaels series' Which this visual novel is a part of is supposed to be considered one of the best     Spoiler alert    I found the ending to be disappointing because as stated in one positive review it doesn’t show the start of the romantic relationship. When the friendship shifts to a lesbian relationship .    To put it bluntly .This is like looking at a movie about an older established married couple in a long flash back remembering how they met. When you get close to where you think your finally getting to . Where you find out how they actually became a couple . It flashes forward to them hoping in the mini van. To pick up the kids from soccer practice or whatever.       What held my interest was I was waiting for the moment of emotional explosion that you knew was coming .That never happened perhaps other novels. In the series explain how these two got together finally and that may be. Just to graphic for steam . As they may have paired that moment of expected emotional release with a moment of sexual release as well. . However I would wait for either a price drop Or some sort of additional free or cheaply priced dlc that shows you the moment they actually did move from a strong friendship to a lesbian relationship.

397330,Little Big Adventure,"love the game, love the fact its enchanced but mine has a loading bug whereby whenever you load a game twinsun just runs into a wall and stays there running :("
397340,SimplePlanes,"This game reminds me of being a kid and building wicked things out of lego :) your possibilities are endless, but there is also a more complex grown-up side to the game with having to balance your machine and its physics so it performs as you would like it to. These two things have come together and made a very good game! plus a good way to relax after a long day and perhaps a bit therapeutic."
397350,Lords of the Realm II,"simply not made to run on higher end systems - sound constantly cuts out and menu items are clicked, but actually do something 20 seconds later. It would be better to get a computer with windows 95 installed and run it that way."
397360,Magician's Apprentice, Early Access Review
397390,Space Food Truck,"This is basically FTL as a deckbuilder (boardgame) style, where you must travel around the map avoiding damage until you can complete &amp; deliver all your recipies, with 4 different rooms/jobs each playing a different hand of job specific &amp; general cards. Great art &amp; fun concept, multiple difficulty levels so good replay value."
397420,Hoyle Official Card Games Collection,"Mostly an OK game, but the AI needs serious work. For example- Canasta. The AI is a friggin joke. They hoard wild cards like they are rare and precious jewels and won't use them even when they could have gone out or made canastas multiple hands ago.   I stopped counting the number of times we could have gone out if only the AI would make a Canasta with a wild card, Then you have the times that it would meld with the exact card that was just placed on the pile which would have allowed our team to pick it up, but choose NOT to pick up the pile while melding with that exact same card and then the next player would immediately pick up the pile and score a huge number of points.  And then you have the times that the AI instead of throwing low value cards like 5 pointers, it would discard higher cards which were sure to allow another player to make a meld. Whoever designed the AI for this game either didn't care, or has never played Canasta in their life.  There is nothing more frustrating than watching hand after hand be lost and be forced to discard card after card that you could have melded or played with, to eventually get what is needed and go out to find the 7 or 8 cards your partner is holding are mostly wild cards.  The AI issue happens in other games where you are playing with a partner as well, so it is extremely frustrating. My 10 year old can play Canasta with more logic and strategy than the AI can.  The other thing is the voices are beyond annoying. The chat comments from the computer players is irritating.   Not sure I would put this as recommended- especially since I paid full price for it. If isn't bad if want to be able to play different card games or learn how to play new ones, as long as you don't mind being frustrated and knowing you will need to turn the volume off so you don't have to hear the stupid dinosaur, dog, and sasquatch talk."
397430,Zoombinis,"Bought this, figuring I'd probably breeze right through the puzzles I struggled with throughout my childhood (it's worth mentioning I played this game for like, my first 6 years of life and still often messed up due to my own impatience... damn those slowly-colliding zoombini bubbles).  I was wrong. Somehow, despite 14 years passing since the last time I touched this game, I am still filled with a dark souls-esque level of frustration during the later difficulties. Still, often, due to my own impatience and hubris. But don't worry; it's a good thing. This is truly a game that children and adults can both play, and find mentally stimulating. Well done.  That said. I do miss the zoombini propeller noises n stuff - if possible, an update with those sounds included when they walk would be great."
397440,Lost Legends: The Weeping Woman Collector's Edition,"Average hidden-object game. Story is so-so. Some original puzzles. Overall, it bored me."
397460,The Jackbox Party Pack 2,"After playing The Jackbox Party Pack I instantly bought this as I thought it would be just as good. Ill quickly go over each game.  Fibbage 2 - Basically an expansion on Fibbage, players pit answers against a question and try and fool players into choosing their choice. 5/5  Earwax - One player chooses a question and the other players choose 2 sound effects that would fit as answers. It's not great as sometimes you have sounds that have NO relevence and it just becomes awkward and stupid at that point. There are some a few good moments however. 2.5/5  Bidots - Discount Drawful; draw pictures and then you go into a virtual auction and attempt to buy art with 'tips' on which is worth the most amount of money. Boring and long. 1.5/5  Quiplash XL - Great game if you have a bunch of people (4+). It's basically Cards against Humanity but you can choose whatever you want and people vote on which options they found the best. 4.5/5  Bomb Corp - Havent attempted yet.  Would I recommend it... Hold off, watch a few Youtube videos. The first installment was 100x better, i'd recommend waiting till a steam sale."

397670,Run Run And Die,"One of those runner games. There's no way to turn off sound or any options besides resolution. Only button you press i jump. Can't change speed. Terrible camera angle that suddenly switches and can lead to many deaths. And deaths during level forces restart of entire level to force increased playtime. The worst part is the terrible hitboxes. I would consistently time a jump right and it would still either count me as getting hit, even though I landed past the item, or that i ran into it before I jumped, even though there was still space between myself and the object. The same annoying loud sounds play throughout. If you press jump 2x or once in the air it will make you jump immediately when you land, leading to forced deaths. Even regular jumps are spaced so that if you don't press it at the exact perfect time you will auto die for not reaching next platform. This game is difficult for the sake of being so, and is frustrating because it forces constant repetition, even though it never feels like it was your fault, which is the worst kind of difficult. Nothing positive to say here. Avoid like the plague.   2/10."

397740,Hylics,What the actual heck? You can play this game :D It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You have to play via 400x400 pixels screen where you can't see anything. While playing there is annoying 'music' in the background of course if you can call it music... Played 10 minutes and i am 100 percent sure i will never play this game again.

397820,Let's Sing 2016,"It looks like if you can hit a single note and hold it, it will counts all others. I know that you can sing an octave higher or lower, since it will be in tune, but just holding a single note should not count. But it is still fun. Hope there will be more songs available (e.g., as dlc).  3 Stars (Good songs to start, -1 since you can't extend the library, -1 for bugs and note matching)"
397830,Zxill: A Legend of Time, Early Access Review
397840,Car Mechanic Manager,"It's got a feel of egg inc. and clash of clans into one, and I like it.   It's a good time waster but if you're looking for a game to play for hours on end I don't recommend it for that but for how fun it can be."
397860,Carnivore Land,the game is bad ，no more words
397870,Arcane Sorcery,"If you wanna test this game for free (why would you though?), go to Kongregate. Did you ever hear about Kongregate? Oh boy, it was long before YouTube was a thing... Either way, the game is a flash clone of HoMM or any other fantasy TBS out there. There are some differences since the 1.0, but the overall quality is pretty much same, described by the words we cannot use in Steam reviews.   http://www.kongregate.com/games/lord_garland/arcane-sorcery "
397940,No Time To Live,"Waste of time...Maybe it is already mentioned in the description in the game, yet the boredom and sameness of days just make you bored.Only thing is different is your final action.Then your a half hour-one hour go waste.There are different ends, yet they are not different story..."
397950,Clustertruck,"Clustertruck is an amazing game built for speedrunners, platformer fans, and gamers alike! It's fast paced action and addicting gameplay will keep the player entertained the whole way through! The controls are very fluid, but I have found some small performance issues, like the game lagging and dropping frames. Other than that, the game played fine. Buyers beware: This game is not for the faint of heart. Coming from someone who beat the whole thing without using an ability; It's hard. You won't spend your whole life on it though, as I beat the whole game in 30 hours. There are other maps available too though, so there is lots of replayability."
397960,Mystery Expedition: Prisoners of Ice,"I liked the game until the last part where the jigsaw puzzles were suddenly no longer an option, and the ending was really abrupt and didn't solve anything. Still, I had fun for 80% of the time."
397970,Abandoned: Chestnut Lodge Asylum,BE PREPARED FOR JUNK-SORTING  Otherwise not too bad. Weird ending.
397990,Woof Blaster,"This is a game that offers you what you see on the trailer, which is a fast-paced shoot'em up with retro graphics, nothing out of this world, but as it offers you something simple, a bit hard and sometimes unfair on the design like the controls and seeing what do your items do but sometimes this is enough to have a good time for a while, definitely shomething that i would recommend for someone who just want to have a goot time playing some old school games."
3980,CivCity: Rome,Very addicting for a short amount of time
39800,Nation Red,"Despite all the praise Nation Red has received it sure felt clunky and mediocre at best. As far as I'm concerned, games like Zombie Shooter and Crimsonland have this beat even without arms and legs.  +Sound effects are okay I suppose +Boss zombies are a nice addition (extra points for Resident Evil players as they're pastiches from that series...or so I hope) +Networking seems to work well and co-op is sort of fun for a moment...  -...until you realize the enemy waves progress tediously slow and the game ends up being boringly repetitive thanks to the otherwise lackluster game mechanics -For a twinstick shooter the player moves very slowly, especially backwards, making the game feel oddly sluggish compared to most games of the genre -Hit detection is sub-par and zombies and enemy bullets that aren't even close seem to do substantial damage -Problems in the hit detection are made worse by the fact that there doesn't seem to be any sound or other effect that would indicate you got hit in the first place -Weapons are crippled by long reload times and none of them feel particularily rewarding to use. One could say they're balanced but they're also very boring -Surprisingly brown mushy zombies blend quite well into brown mushy backgrounds -Odd issues with music volume reseting to maximum every time the background track changes -The 'single player campaign' is a joke in both content and difficulty except for one or two difficulty spikes"
398000,Little Big Adventure 2,"An oldie but a goldie. I bought this one to support it and the company who produced it as I loved it as a much younger guy. Everyone who also enjoyed LBA and LBA2 wished and prayed along with me that we'd see LBA3, which sadly never emerged. This game is the only that touched my heart with its immersive story and beautiful soundtrack, it felt like the fairy tales my mother would read to me as a child, so precious. Today the game looks quite dated and it's control system leaves a lot to be desired but you'll soon forget and accept that. Imagine LBA VR, now there's a concept, just joking of course but who knows what's in store for Twinsen."

398450,Absent,"Amazing game, would definitely would recommend this game. The game was very enjoyable to me and some parts I had to look up cause I got stuck but, it's definitely worth it considering the fact that's it's completly free to dowload and play. Though there are a few small things that could have been improved but, I think it's still an amazing game."
398460,Mooch,"This is a nice little game,I like the gameplay and the little story."
398530,Ghost Cleaner,"lots of different levels, there's a lot of strategy , it's worth while for all the family."
398620,Living Legends: The Frozen Fear Collection,"Two great Hidden Object games for a really nice price. If you like this kind of games, don't hesitate. Beatiful landscapes and nice music, repetitive, though. It works perfectly under Windows 10, no crashes at all. You must press ESC button at the beginning of the game if you only hear a sound and see a black screen."
398630,Twisted Lands Trilogy Collector's Edition,"Quite enjoyed this game trilogy, as any game it has it's ups and downs though, quite alot of hidden object games which i loved, however there were the few objects which were hard to make out sometimes resulting in my pressing the hint button annoyingly, the storylines were pretty good, i played the origins one last, there were a few minor glitches of slowness during game also, i enjoyed the games altogether though, worth the amount i paid, and would reccommend to hidden object game lovers."
398640,Bowl Bound College Football,"Game is not very realistic or rewarding. When you recruit you dont feel like you are getting anywhere and seems random if they swing your way or not. The actual games feel predetermined as the previous poster suggested, you are not picking plays to set up other plays like other football simulators - there is no need to be strategic.   I gave 25 hours to this game so, I tried very hard to like it with the lack of any NCAA type games availble but, no dice."
398670,Shadow Heroes: Vengeance In Flames, Early Access Review
398680,Ace of Words, Early Access Review
398710,Timberman,"The game is polished and performs well, but unfortunately it lacks depth.  The premise is simple: chop down a tree a quickly as you can without being hit by the tree's branches. You can command your character to chop the tree from either the left or the right side, but if you chop too slowly or hit a tree branch it's game over.  The multiplayer option is nice if you have someone to play with as it can add longevity to the game, but if I'm being honest here you've more or less experieced everything the game has to offer after just a few minutes of playing. It's for this reason that I can't really bring myself to recommend the game, although it is cheap if you do feel like giving it a try. Perhaps wait for a sale, though."

398850,Epistory - Typing Chronicles,"Pros:  -Art is gorgeous, and together with the soundtrack, it provides a relaxing experience -Puzzle elements (although they are relatively easy) -Encourages exploration -Each dungeon is unique from each other -Each of the 4 elements (water, fire, wind, spark) have their advantages and disadvantages. The player can also switch the elements at any point. -Unique way to tell the story -The difficulty scales (with adaptive difficulty turned on) -Arena mode enables the player to have more practice on their typing skills  Cons:  -Sometimes the words can be blocked by the environment. For example, when playing in the labriynth arena, the words can be blocked by the trees. I feel that for a typing game, the words should always be visible, since reaction time is critical. -When clearing the corrupted nests, the narration should be paused, as the player would be too focused on the enemies to pay any attention to the story. -With that said, the story is meh. Can be improved. -Rather short (I finished it in 13 hours because I was grinding for all the achievements - the story can be completed in as little as 5 hours)  Verdict: 8/10  Conclusion:   Its mechanics and art are amazing and you don't even have to be good at typing to enjoy this game. The relaxing experience would be a good break from other hardcore games."
398920,Tisnart Tiles,"hello everybody its me woodlandfaerietruck! the bundle stork brought me another game today. this one is called tisnart tiles. thats a pretty bad name, but i was excited anyway because i usually like this kind of thing. it probably is fun. the pictures of the game on steam make it look like a good time, but i had a couple of big problems with it.  you see, dear friends, baby jesus blessed me with sensitive ears, so it truly pains me when the game makes the most obnoxious noise you could imagine everytime i make a match that counts towards one of the goals for the level. holy dogshit on a stick sitting on the sidewalk on a hot summers day, i don't know how anyone could think that putting in such an annoying sound that happens so frequently is a good idea. after a few minutes of listening to it, my cat vomitted, one of my guinea pigs died, and my girlfriend promised i could watch one whole episode of star trek if i turned the volume down. it was that bad!  the other thing that pisses me off is that i have to play through a whole bunch of pathetically easy levels to get to the ones that might be fun. i got up to level 10, and i am still at the point where i can mindlessly click anywhere on the board to beat the level with no effort whatsoever. it looks like i still have over a dozen more levels to go before i even get through the levels that are called 'easy peasy'. that sucks. there is no way to skip ahead to the levels that are probably fun to play. i don't want to eat through a bowl of dogshit because someone put ice cream at the bottom. jesus has blessed me with over 2700 steam games. evil sinner devs had better bring the fun or i am moving onto something else.  in closing, i am done with this one. these evil sinner devs had a chance, but they blew it by testing my patience. give me an option to skip all the levels that wouldn't challenge a mentally crippled 5 year old, and i might be back. until then, i cannot recommend this game to humans who value their time. robots may enjoy the monotony of clicking randomly to win. animals will likely suffer permanent harm due to the terrible sound effects. negative 15 stars out of ten.  "
398930,MacGuffin,cool
398940,Respawn Man,"I recommend it if you can get it for under a dollar.  I beat the game itself in about an hour and a half, and getting 100% of achievements afterward in about 30 minutes.  I feel like the developer intended on a thriving community to add content to the game after the fact, but a clunky UI for the level builder made me not want to make any levels beyond the one required for the achievement.  Controls seemed tight at first until I realized there was a bit of recovery after jumping, making segments with repeated jumps frustrating. You have to pause briefly before attempting to jump again or you'll keep running forward. This caused a few cheap deaths for me.  If you can beat Super Meat Boy, you'll find this game too easy and too short.  Me, I liked it enough, but I wouldn't have paid full price. I'm still giving it a thumbs up though because I'd like to see more from the dev. He had a great idea, it just fell a little short. It's an above average game, though."
398960,Hoven the Sages Spinel,  This game is a poorly made old-style RPG. I got sick of the gameplay after just about two fights and I didn't quite catch the story. Also instead of mana potions what you use to replinish mana is called 'Magic Water'. There were several more items with trash names.
398970,Fasaria World Online,"No steam integration. You have to register an account and give your email in order to play. This developer has only awful games with fake reviews and after it downvoted my reviews with from two accounts i will not give my email i'm actively using and i don't want to bother creating a fake one. i'm afraid they will post my email to spam lists, you can expect everything from them, if you don't like their games. This stillborn was just released in bundle, so i'm expect more negative reviews. I've already ordered some popcorn to watch this fall down into mixed zone."
398980,Without Within 2,I love Without Within! Hearing the development of W.W2 made me very happy and the story delivers! A funny story that you can pick up and read whenever. 2 things that i didnt really like is the 'Tour guide' aspect. it felt like there was more Melbourne explanations then there was of Vinty at some points. which defeats the purpose cause I want to see more Vinty :p. that and also the consistant mentioning of her life back home compared to the trip. comparing the two can be funny but it felt slightly over used later on in the story. besides those I enjoyed the story and would highly recommend this to people!

399090,It's time to get out from the solar system,"I can appreciate a good wierd indie game, but this was tragic. The intro was pure ♥♥♥♥. 8 minutes wasted completly from my life."
399120,Prospekt,"Prospekt is a simplistic, yet very nice use of the Source Engine, but seemingly only using Half-Life 2 assets, minimally with custom ones. Unlike most i've talked to that have played this game, I don't have a problem with this, since it is supposed to be part of the Half-Life 2 story and previous games. If you're unfamiliar with the collaboration back in 1999 between Valve and Gearbox Software, the game, 'Half-Life: Opposing Force', it is esentially made to take place at the exact same time that Half-Life takes place, just in the view of United States Marine, Adrian Shephard. This game is a continuation of that game, with the same character, Corporal Shephard. The game does create familiarity with those that have played Half-Life 2, with things extremely simular to Nova Prospekt, and the Citadel. Bottomline, the usage of the the familiar assets, creates a more inviting environment for those that might not be familiar with anything past that.   Now, many of the complaints i've heard about this game, most especially, that the puzzles are very easily solved, and the game as a whole is too short. Sure, that's not wrong, but the puzzles does have a bit of fun to them in trying to figure it out, with how simplistic or complex it could be. About it being short, yes, it took me less than 2 hours to complete it, and I did it in one day. I really don't have a problem with that, as it does open the door for replay value, because you know it won't take long to do; The game could also be replayed while listening to the Developer Commentary, from Mr. Richard Seabrook himself.   The way I see it, yes, the game is short, and looks a little lazy due to it being a reusage of assets, and being simple, but like I said, it's fun to figure out the puzzles the first time, and has some replay value. But, me, as a huge Half-Life fan, who has played every game more than once or twice...or maybe more...had fun with this little game, because it does feel simular and is very close to what you'd imagine Valve would do themselves. I honestly think that as long as you've got an open mind, and some time, you could enjoy this game, especially if you're a Half-Life fan. "

399240,XNemesis, Early Access Review
399260,Alice's Mom's Rescue,"AMR is an amateurish platformer where you must use a size changing mechanic to navigate puzzle levels. The graphics and sound are functional, if a bit hard on the senses, and the controls are passable. The speed at which your character moves when small sized is not passable however and is a constant annoyance. This plays like someones 1st game project, it's complete and does everything that it tries to do but doesn't really try to do anything difficult or interesting. pros um cons boring as hell not recommended unless you are looking for a simple children's game, and even then there are better options 1/5"
399430,Tinboy,"Pros: - Good idea for puzzles, fun to play - It's a long game. For its price it gives 60 levels which is sweet. The puzzles ain't so easy either.  Cons: - Music. This is first thing that comes to mind. The music is so annoying, and it always starts over when replaying the level (getting stuck, that's why) and it feels so glitchy, but the reason is just rushed game design - Graphics. It's okay, decent, but all the backgrounds and levels and so on looks so same. This just looks so copy-paste everywhere, rushed, done in few days / weeks. - Controls... terrible, very terrible.  overall rating 3/10"
399520,Comedy Quest,The comedy about the Comedy Quest is the quest.
399530,Hyspherical 2,After playing the first ten levels of Monkeybin AS’s extremely well presented and excitingly challenging Hyspherical 2 I realized that this was the perfect game to gather some thoughts from Ainslie. She loves logic puzzles and the game is adorable – even if its just a series of puzzles featuring shapes that you press on to create spheres that must travel one full revolution without hitting another. I thought that she would love this game. Until now I’ve been somewhat reluctant to have her play and review much more than hidden object games or Empires of the Gods which was up her alley way because of the Egyptian setting. This game will likely be a little bit more challenging for her but I believe that what she will have to say will sell the product to you better than what I can.  For me the game’s challenge and the manner in which it is presented are the game’s greatest strengths. The game is adorably cute and executed to perfection. The challenge is ever present throughout the game is never unfair. The tag line of the game ‘possibly impossible’ does a very good job of summarising the game. I very much enjoyed my time with Hyspherical 2 and since playing I have returned several times when I’ve only had a few minutes to play. It’s just one of those games that is perfect for that purpose.  A review on this game would be incomplete without advising you that you get an achievement every time you complete a level with three stars (ensure you complete the level without any spheres colliding into each other). There are also achievements for destroying spheres and creating spheres and for completing the bonus levels. There are 125 standard levels in the game and 25 bonus levels. Therefore the achievement hunters will find that the number of achievements within this game are as easy to get as good as they are at completing the game themselves.  Now for a couple of pearls from Ainslie…  AINSLIE’S LITTLE PEARLS  This game may appear simple at first but it takes a keen eye and an ability to discern the mechanisms of each individual shape. I found this game somewhat Zen like in it’s simplicity. Following the rotations brought a sense of calm. The achievement of completing each puzzle gives you a small sense of accomplishment. Playing the game becomes about how far you can challenge yourself. I feel this is a game I would use to bring me down from the pressure and stresses of the day to a simple honed existence to bring you back to living in the moment.

399600,I and Me,"This is a rather cute puzzle game, great for passing the time.  Art style is simple and very pleasant to the eye. It gets a bit repetitive as you advance through the levels but it does not take away from the fun. If you get stuck at any point there is a built in hint system that is very helpful. Bonus: Kitties!  "
399640,Flamebreak,Awesome little randomized ARPG / Bullethell lots of skill combos help it not get old and runs normaly take 10-20 minutes so its good for quick little sessions or a marathon of different builds!
399660,Battle Battalions,"Another failed iteration of End of Nations. The game is dead, you'll never match with anyone. At least you can play with the abysmally weak AI..."
399670,Game Corp DX,"tl;dr - forget this, go buy Game Dev Tycoon :-)  long version:  This game isn't inherently bad. It just focuses on wrong things.  It's nice to have 40+ workers after an hour or two, it's nice to rebuild your office every few minutes and enhance it with flowers and statues... But is this what game development is about? I don't think so...  Do you want to know all your developers by name? Well, they just become numbers in few minutes. Do you want to create fantasy games? Sci-fi? History? Sorry, not here. Do you want to develop sequels, DLCs, expansions? MMO or MOBA maybe? Nothing like this here.  After few attempts, game development shrinks to looking at numbers and bars - genre does not matter, people don't matter, even game name does not matter, since the randomly generated one is fine and you wanna go for quantity anyway.  Campaign is done for in 3 hours (and doesn't tell you it's over, just goes on without any endgame), and 'challenge' game is just a sandbox game with more achievements.  I guess it just makes a good EA GAMES simulator - horde of anonymous workers, developing games which are all the same, dubious work, big profits, but almost no fun.  If you want to really play game developer, go buy Game Dev Tycoon instead, or buy this in sale, the dollar or two of price just may be ok for few hours of gameplay."
399780,Expand,One of the best simple puzzle games I've played so far.
399790,Destiny Warriors,"Fun to play at start, but then gets very annoying when u have to dissolve party and get your characters on their own path. Dropped it on Lightning progression, golems made me rage."
399820,Kopanito All-Stars Soccer,"I'm probably just gonna repeat what others have already said, but this game is a real gem, a fantastic tribute to the likes of Microprose Soccer (those 'banana' shots!), Kick-Off and Sensible Soccer (not to mention some of the '90s side-scrolling football games at the arcades). Yeah, it's not FIFA or PES...but IMO it's actually better than both when it comes to the pure 'fun' factor.  Hopefully, it will attract more and more people to the online scene as well. DEFINITELY recommended."
399890,The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent,"This is a consistently good game with a few exceptions. The gameplay is point-and-click and plays like Riven or Myst but is a bit more forgiving and has a more modern and more cartoony artstyle. The story is capturing and interesting, and the animated cutscenes remind me a lot of Myst, but might look sloppy and lazy to new players.  The voice acting is something I think they could have done much better, the dialouge does not sound convicing at all, but I wouldn't say that they ruin the game. Most of the puzzles are fairly innovative and non-repetetive wich keeps the gameplay interesting and challenging, and gives you a kick that makes you feel like a genious when you finally figure it out. The Hint and Skip buttons can ruin this to some extent so i would advise new players who are just getting in to the genre to only use them when you get stuck, and not get impatient and speed through the game. I think this is a great game for beginner point-and-click Adventure players as it is pretty straight forward and you always have the Hint and Skip button to rely on if you get stuck. But seasoned players can play on the hardest difficulty to disable these options and get more of a challenge out of it. (+ some achievments).   This is overall a good game and i would recommend it to all players who are into or want to get into point-and-click adventure games."
399900,Mad Snowboarding,"What a horrible, gigantic mess this is. I keep looking for a snowboarding game on PC and thought I'd give this a shot, wow...just bad, in every possible way. Bad controls, bad menus, bad tracks, bad progression, did I mention it was really bad?  Avoid at all costs."
399910,Ookibloks,"This game is obviously a 'patched' game from tablets, made it obvious by how the game or trailer, can't remember where I saw that, states that it is DLC free and such. The lives and daily challenges are very likely to be relics of the game being available for free on tablets, but don't quote me on that, I may be very wrong.  Anyway, not claiming this is a problem, but it does make lives pretty much irrelevant and somewhat annoying since a game over screen is pretty much a loss of time. There's also the fact that there's no quick and easy way to reset a level when you try to go for a perfect combo and the background graphics seem to 'break' if the resolution gets too big (On the world map with a resolution of 1600 X 900)  However, beside those nitpicks, the game is really nice. I saw that the music was given with the game and I was sceptical about it really worth being MP3s and oh boy was I wrong. The music is superb and really catchy, probably my favorite aspect of the game. I like the music so much that I went on the data files (\resource\shared\sfx) and got the actual music files myself and added .ogg to them so I get the real music files to listen to :P The MP3s have some very noticeable compression artifacts.  The gameplay is simple but challenging, controls are very responsive, however as I said the lack of a Retry button is annoying.  I also expected a custom level editor for that kind of game but it seems there is none of that. I didn't complete the game so maybe it unlocks once you finished it"
399920,Blowy Fish,"Feels like the crap mobile port that it is. You pull on this fish and fling him along this narrow sloping corridors of levels. There are things that instant kill you along the way and if you die you restart the level over again. The best part is you can only see a tiny bit of the level, meaning you just randomly fling him forward having no clue if he'll run into something or not. It's pretty dumb and poorly designed. After you die you have to play a minigame to get items to dress the fish up in, which I guess is what flies for 'replay value' in free mobile games of which this is. But the levels feel the same and when you die it never feels like your fault. Theres no story. That's literally all there is to this game. Game starts with you in a game, not even on the main menu. Theres no video or resolution options that I could find in the terrible UI. Just skip this like all other free mobile ports on steam.   2.5/10."
40,Deathmatch Classic,It's fun and it's empty.
400,Portal,"Do I really even need to say anything? It's Portal!  If you haven't ever played, it is a puzzle/platformer. The gameplay is very fun, and GLaDOS's sarcasm is pretty funny.  TLDR: One of the BEST games on PC. (Totes worth it!) Also, grab Portal 2 to play after Portal."
4000,Garry's Mod,The game is super good the only problem with it is I NEED TO USE MY TOOL GUN FOR TEXTURES!  Yes there is the  -dxlevel 90? but that causes the screen to look weird so you guys need to update it and fix it i am going to say no but when it is fixed i will turn this into a yes textures is the must have!

400030,Cloney,"HOLY MOLY - what a rage game!! I'm still sweating! This is one of those games which looks SOOO easy, but are hard to hande as ♥♥♥♥! Really, no jokes! I've rage quitted that game several times + swear to myself i'd never touch it again, but then i've bought a controller which i definetly recommend to all!  I had the 2 hardest achievements open - ive started with the controller to finally got over 40 coins in a single run. After i've achieved on of my hardest TOP 3 achievements so far; 'just' lasting 15 minutes (!!!) without dying. My heart beat like a drum, with every minute more and more - wow.  The free game got zero content, but i recommend for everybody, who search a challenge.  5/10"
400040,ShareX,verry gucci much perfection  great program i rlly like to use it really awpsome
400110,Else Heart.Break(),"Some people do not like thumbs down on games that spark interest. Else grabbed my attention and I could not wait to play. However the game is very difficult to really endorse.  It could have been good, could have been great, requires serious refinement however and will not appeal to general gamers. Underneath are a lot of great ideas that are strung together with really mindless dull conversations and NPC interactions.  FULL REVIEW  http://gonewiththewin.com/if-else-heart-break-then-review-wut/   This is a hardcore RPG with very long periods of low intensity conversation and simple 'adventures'. Hardcore in that there is no handholding, no UI or designated scripted guidance for anything you do. The inclusion of programmer-esque hacking later on is pretty neat, and a novel idea. I just did not enjoy the constant slowness and almost nonexistant plot for such long stretches of the game. Good art design, well made, and musically sound, lots to explore and investigate, but minimal return on story or in depth character development."
400160,Concrete Jungle,A lesser known gem with an unexpectedly good campaign.
400170,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut,"When I think of the term Final Cut, the idea of 'This is our studio's best effort' or 'This is it, completely bug free and ready for retail.' Instead, this is a trilogy of two good Van Helsing games, and one questionable one, wrapped tightly in a frustratingly unbalanced and bugged package.  Mobs are uninspired with only one or two strategies: zerg rush or sit back and shoot with 100% accuracy. Both have badly scaled stats that'll leave you tearing your hair out or toggling the difficulty. Yeah, that's a thing, you're not locked into your difficulty when you start the game. Thank goodness for small favors, but I can tell it's just a way of saving face since nobody at Neocore seems to be good with numbers, character growth pacing, or debugging. (I have quests that were bugged since the trilogy and they're still not fixed) Gear doesn't matter (in a loot game of all things) key skills in all classes were significantly nerfed, but at least the game is generous with gold since it's your leading currency for deciding to revive yourself from where you just died to crowd control resistant swarms or back at your base and walk a bit to die to the same mobs within seconds. Of course there are plenty of exploits and builds made specifically to exploit them, but why bother when you're only going to use 1/5 of your available skills just to survifve? The tagline says final cut, but it plays like an early alpha. I can't reccomend this for it's current retail. Maybe get it on sale. But there's way better (properly balanced) options out there."
400180,Okhlos: Omega,"Okhlos is a cute game to play for a bit, but gets old very quickly. I personally got bored less than an hour into the game, and promptly returned it. New enemies and levels are barely distinguishable from one another, and the mob control mechanics are clunky and imprecise (which is especially annoying with traps). While the game is technically replayable in an isaac-like style, there's no real motivation to continue playing outside of the first run.  A novel concept, but not enough content and enjoyment to warrant buying."
400200,The Mystery of a Lost Planet,"Beautiful art, interesting scenery and nice music, and the puzzles are quite logical. A few relaxing hours for a holiday or weekend."

400370,Normality,Despite the title this game is far from normal
400410,OASE - Other Age Second Encounter,"Even though I really like Zeiva's other work, OASE left me with mixed feelings... It has it's bright points - most characters are nicely drawn, some endings are really funny and minigames are interesting and challenging just right...  However, sometimes the game is just trying too much to be funny and it ends just being dumb and weird, personalities are shallow and it's hard to make any connection to them at all and it takes sooooo long to get correct ending. Big minus for me is the 'save' system, which there is none, but you get passwords as you progress and you can use those to resume your game. But they does not work for every moment in the game; for ex. when you're near an ending and it all depends on one choice which one you will get, but last password was before 10 minute long minigame. So if you want to get both endings, you have to go through that 10 minute grind again... And it doesn't happen just once...  Overall, there are better games to buy for 20€ and to use your time on."
400450,NeuroVoider,"Great game with excellent developer support.  No linux fussing to get running.  A+, would recommend again!"
400470,The Seven Years War (1756-1763),The game Sucks!
400500,MadOut Ice Storm,"The actual racing is pretty passable and the graphics are about right for the game and price, but the rest... It has the tedious microtransactions I'd expect from a Fee To Play game, the interface is dodgy, and the 'full controller support' is barely functional.  If it weren't for the microtransactions, I'd say it's worth getting for a quid or two on sale. But with in-game purchases... no."
400510,FINAL TAKE,*_* This game is awful *_* I hated it so much *_* It's like Slender meets a walking-sim *_* There's no story or intriguing ambiguity *_* Uninstalled *_* UwU *_*
400580,Black Closet,"This game was a great deal of fun. I found it had far, far more depth than I at first supposed. The story branched nicely and the elements which are expertly randomized make for a surprising degree of replayability- I will definitely be playing this again soon. The romantic aspects of the story were also greatly appreciated. The game was more challenging than I expected too with an interesting end boss scenario. Taken all together, I can recomend this game whole heartedly."
400630,Wuppo - Definitive Edition,It's a fun and chill game where you can spend a few hours!
400660,Reverse Crawl,"Unpolished and bland. Besides the grainy, poorly scaled graphics that look like a Flash game, the actual gameplay is dull and forgettable. I spent 30 minutes barely paying attention to fights I wasn't invested in and then refunded."
400710,Bleeding Blocks,"Great game. Epic, single screend deathmatch based on skill, tactics, and reflexes. Classes, different weapons, sentries, and much more. EPIC!!"
400740,VERGE:Lost chapter,"My God, I have never experienced such a confusing game. Although this work of art is s.hit, the main focus I'm going to delve into here is that it is an all over the place screwed up game guru piece, that literally changes from an aslym for which theres seems to be no purpose, to traversing in a hole being given a crappy piece on context making no sense, followed by a skull gathering activity. Then back to the asylm randomly into a checmial field that will appear after going through some doors. My god this is one of the most astounding things i have ever played, and i've had the pleasure of playing a number of turd games such as Slaughtering grounds, dead effect and coma motuary. I am literally speechless  Other then that perfectly fine, well made for a game guru virus"
400790,The Juicer,for a game with wonky controlles its mind numingly fun
400800,MXGP2 - The Official Motocross Videogame,"One-hour-after-playing-kind-of-review. ============================  This game is my first experience of playing a Motocross game after playing 'Championship Motocross (ft. Ricky Carmichael)' on PS1. Since then, I've barely touched any MX game.   Right from the rider creation screen to my first race in Championship mode where I've completed one race, the game felt smooth, it felt polished and fun to ride. When I jumped into my first race I've already practiced for 15 minutes with Basic physics and manual weight-distribution settings. The Championship setting was on easy. All in all it was very fun. On my first attempt I crashed and came last. On my second attempt I've managed to come 14th. A lot of fun, guys.  The only issue I've encountered is after I watched a tutorial video. My game froze and I had to ctrl+alt+del. But it didn't stop me. I learned the basics in free practice.  Don't know how the veterans of MX PC games feel about this game, but for me as a newcomer, it sure felt great!  Recommend to all newbs like me!  9/10 "
400880,Ultimate Rock Crawler,Game is not bad like people says.  This game has potential just belive on it!    Gameplay
400910,Rabi-Ribi,"It would be fun, apart from it's clunky controls, buggy level design and poor story which leaves you backtracking to areas you've already been, exploring rooms you've already explored just because you've unlocked one tiny little thing and there might be something in the room that was previously inaccessable.   Unless those things excite you, give it a pass."
40100,Supreme Commander 2,"Coming on the back of the epic forged alliance, SUPCOM 2 fails to live upto the great design of the first game. That being said, this is a solid RTS game. The tech tree replaces the tier system and the game focuses more on the combat from the start due to the simplified economy model. Where this game does shine is with the ability to tweak the AI to make a challenging game and the netcode which doesn't seem to lag like the first game with larger maps. A good game but not as good as the first."
401090,Modo indie,"Let me just say I love this software! I've used a lot of 3D modeling programs in the past, but this one has been the best all package I've come across in a long time. Blender is frustraiting, Silo 2, 3D Coat and Maya are hard to master. This program does everything those programs do, but way easier to master. Seriously, I learned how to use this program in less than 2 days and actually had something to show for it.   Pros Easy to use. Professional quality modeling software, doesn't crash, 'just works' exports easily, imports easily. Animation system is amazing. Seriously as far as software goes, there is nothing negative I can say. I love this software, it's so much better than anything I've used previously. I actually understand it!  Cons Subscription is $16 a month if you get it in 6 month blocks, this is kind of hard to swing as the previously mentioned software (with exception to Maya) are about the same as the 6 month block to own (about $96). To buy an outright indie license is $300.   I bought 6 months previously, loved it, but am torn on whethor to renew for another 6 months or wait until a sale / I get $300 together. It sucks to rent it, because if you're like me and working fulltime at a day job, you can only use the software for a few hours a week during the weekend. That said, $300 is a fair price for something this easy to use with this kind of feature depth, LOVE the animation / boning system! I guess my only wish would be that they could do a rent to own feature, where after you get through 3 six month blocks you get an actual indie license, but hey I understand devs gotta eat, etc."
401120,Anode,"I like this quite a bit. It's a falling block puzzler where you have to make chains and detonations a la Tetris 2, but with some twists that keep it interesting, including items that do various things to make your life easier and clear pieces from the board, and overlapping connections between pieces that leave potential for extremely huge combos.  I think the biggest draw here is the 'missions' mode, which is basically the regular game, but requires you to accomplish small tasks throughout (destroy chains of 5 blocks of less, don't drop for x seconds, etc) that add a nice level of strategy to think about while still juggling the basic puzzle formula.This mode is preferable to the traditional endless mode for me because the speed doesn't just steadily creep upward and is dictated by how many missions you complete instead. Really gives you time to think about your next move and ease you into the later chaos more naturally, in my opinion.  Presentation is nothing special, but the mechanics are sound. Overall, it's not revolutionary, but it's a really well put together game that mixes ♥♥♥♥ up just enough to make it feel fresh."
401170,Birth of Shadows,"Very enjoyable game with interesting 'rage' mechanics. Fights consist of exchanging spells, scaring enemies so that you can pick them off one at a time, taking advantage of their rage and unleashing it against them for mega damage. Very intelligent and original spin on the action rpg."
401190,Dinosaur Hunt,IT WASTED MY ♥♥♥♥ING MONEY  NOBODY PLAYS IT
401200,Invisible Apartment 2,"Much like the acclaimed film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Invisible Apartment 2 is a sequel. Unlike Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Invisible Apartment 2 is not about an android sent back in time to murder someone and change the future. Despite the glaringly obvious omission of a murderous, time traveling android, the game very much holds up on its own. Much like Terminator 2: Judgement day, I believe Invisible Apartment 2 will be seen by critics as superior to the original and become the highest grossing film of 1991.  Full disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter."
401210,Puzzle Sages,"games still a bit buggy the green level for easy/medium/hard are unbeatable. Same for the hard mode far right level. And then theres the 4 button room on hard. While theortically beatable, yeah ♥♥♥♥ no."
401250,Zulu Response, Early Access Review
401290,Nusakana,"There are too many missing core elements of gameplay to make your game actually an enjoyable experience. I felt there was no plot, no general storyline, only odd side-quests. And while roaming around talking to everyone, might be fun for some, it gives you no reward. Some areas of improvement are graphics, the text-bars could even be on a transparent color, (Blue signifies a win95 color scheme, we are in the 21st century), and battle balancing. Also you should be able to switch characters mid-battle or use items without costing a turn. Starting out in the game and I realise the reason for forcing the player to the inn, instead of allowing them to walk there; but you have side-quests that are deceptive because you obviously cant beat them because you die in two hits. You should always ask a second opinion before you present some thing to the public, especially if you are asking for support. If it had gone to early access I feel like they could have asked the community for ideas and suggestions, we can always improve oursleves. They have a tough road ahead of themselves, most gamers get that, with going up against the big dogs that have done it better and been around longer. I will say I do like the humour and I do like the pixel art. They did a good job with the music track/sound, although as others have said the grammar is off, although I dont mind that as long as I have a reason to play. But you need to show more heart and originality because currently it is lacking badly. As I say if they had brought it to early access you could have asked the community for support but as a fully released game, it needs to be fully done. And while it might be in one persons eyes, it isnt worth the price point. How many times do we say it. You cant just put items in a game and expect that alone to add to the games core content. You need to stand out and bring some thing NEW to the table."
401330,Akuatica,"I like the concept behind the game, looks great but the major problem I find is having no controller support, which is essential for some players like me."
401360,The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human,"This was a pretty good game. A 2D version of Shadow of the Colossus but underwater. You explore the seas looking for boss monsters that drop upgrades that let you reach further areas into the game. It really shines in terms of colorful backgrounds and beautiful background music.  The boss battles are tough but beatable. If you're having a hard time with one, try to come back later when your ship's more powerful. The game's not linear so you go around and kill bosses in different orders. However, there are areas that will require you to have certain upgrades to your shift to proceed.  The game isn't long but enjoyable. It definitely puts up a fight so you either ready your reflexes or learn from trial and error. Definitely a worthwhile experience."
401420,Match 3 Revolution,"This game is new perspective of '3 in a row' genre. Physics based, colorfull and very addictive) I recommend to buy it on a sale."
401510,Lavapools,"  I really liked the gameplay of the game, it felt addicting and whenever I died it felt like it was my fault and not the games! I loved the music and especially that it is dynamic. It is a neat little feature that was very well implemented. The only thing I did not like that much were the UI's of the game, which could have been more intuitive but then again, a UI is not the main function of a game! For the price, I would totally recommend this game!  Disclaimer: The developer gave me a key to test his game and produce a video about it on my channel iKliklaLP. Though this is technically a product placement, my point of video was not biased by that!"
401550,Legena: Union Tides,"A 'lil, maybe unknown, pearl.  When i was first thrown into the game ( choosing the highest difficulty for enemies, so i base my judgment with that in mind ) i was kinda lost: You don't know the characters; It's clear they already had their share of adventures but you can hardly understand why they react/behave in some way early game. You get tutored but lil by lil like before entering a new area or before a boss fight. It was easy at the begining, later knowing the mechanics really helped out~ Enemies Lack a 'level' reference, later it's not that important, but when i was looking for a better place to level... i usually got oneshoted. There's not world map map (at least i didn't notice one XD), locations do get pinpointed in dialogues but i occasionaly didn't know where a place was. Accessories lack their description in shops (apart statuses preventing ones), not a big problem tou   After finishing the game well:  Music was fabolous all game long!! Love those battle themes &lt;3 Extra Side-quests i found were EXTREMELY enjoyable, especially    The cave of valor. Finding a part of Atesan past in Tetiro's 'future' was really unexpected, the necklace seemed a simple background item  . Characters were fine, i was happy they were of different races, just a bit of a bother... some of them seems to 'settle down' their problems with too much ease in particular   after each met the narrator  , same with their opinion from time to time. But among them   Atesan surely shine, i appreciated, and liked, the dedication to his story    Leveling... doesn't seems to be very rewarding, equips are simply better at handling stats. Add abusing of all buffs (or *coff* Dragon Helm *coff*) + debuffs and you can easily wreak havoc among enemies. Still, Bosses took a lil of strategy to be beaten, especially last ones. Main cause of a character death were a conjuction of spell+weather or a KO skill. Secret items EVERYWHERE OMG, be it a city... be it a dungeon... those helped a lot at making the game easier and i screamed 'CHRONO TRIGGER!' each time i found one :3 (only thing missing... the sound :P) After finishing the game you get some secret words which should unlock things, i'll surely replay it!  All in all, there'd be more things to say, but, if you're looking for a nice retro style game, this one is worth your money, they really put lots of effort and care in it and sadly, lately, you can only find this dedication in indie games...  I'll eagerly wait for the next installment"

401780,Driveby Gangster,"I don't think Drive By gangster is a good as other players are suggesting it is. I personally found it clunky to play, with some of the NPC's being impervious to bullets, whilst thoes other NPC fell to the ground.   Overall the timings of the the game are really off the mark, to the point where the example screen grabs in the store front, are not a fair example of the real game play experiance. In my case, if I didn't hold down the D key too speed up the car. The NPC's would kill my charictor before the window of opertunity too shoot the target, became available.   This is nothing more than a poor quality duck hunt game, that is packaged with a morral blurb that seems like an after thought given what the game is about. I won't be playing this again as it's just a slow paced game, with a lot of bugs in the game.   This should be a 99¢&nbsp;game and not £2.79.    "

401820,FATED: The Silent Oath,"Fated is an amazing VR game.  Reasons to buy:  1. Compelling and emotional storyline. 2. Beautiful design. 3. Simple but fun puzzles. 4. Amazing voice acting. 5. Great implementation of decision-making (being able to nod your head).  Is it worth $20? I think so. But if you're not sure, pick it up at the Steam sale or something. I loved the story and the characters and I absolutely enjoyed the game. Thanks"
401840,ChargeShot,"a very fun platformer deathmatch.  simple controls, 8-bit sound AND graphics, fast-paced action, and a sense of humour. something you can play with your children.  fantastic as a multiplayer casual game for friday night parties.   here is a review / first time playing video "
401890,ARSLAN: THE WARRIORS OF LEGEND,"Im not a fan of this type of games, (im Not an Otaku) but that´s not the reason to put a bad review.  Actually the game looks nice..., but the optimization is from far the worst of the game, example: i set the video options on full screen, and the game stills open the game in window mode, it has frames drops to 30 at 7, it has micro stuttering, doesnt run fluid at all. In general this game has performance issues. its not a good port like the fanboys of anime says in positive reviews. Maybe the game is not optimize for SLI video cards.    I already ask a refund.  Fan boys and virgins Otakus gonna hate this review , but someone needs to do the job. keep coming u r so funny virgin guys :v"

402030,Zenohell,"Boring as boring can be: welcome to Zenohell!   It's forgivable that a one team game doesn't do much effort to animate boss enemies but they forgot to animate the player ship. A clever score system is virtually non-existent.  This game is bad to its core. Ugly, generic and dull."
402040,The Guest,"Well done game. Beautifully made. The developers obviously put their hearts into it.   Puzzles are balanced, with some more challenging that others (but, that's the way adventure games are SUPPOSED to be).   My only complaint is that I wish it were longer. Would've enjoyed spending more time in the atmospheric environment."

During his time in a new school he explores the Swim club, a club who specialises in super sexy, tight swim suits, and swimming I guess.   Upon joining the club (with only two people in it) He gets emotionally attatched to two s̶l̶u̶t̶s̶ students named Hiroki and Meiko. Hiroki is a white haired, Double D, all time champion of swimming considering those watermelons of hers could end up sinking her to the bottom of the ocean. Meiko is a snobby b**** who nags on EVERY.

Lets just say that this game would leave you amazed. So you better get a CUMfortable chair and release your steam wallet into the sticky, wet walls of this game.  I r8 8/8 while i masterb8... -H patch is recommended"
402190,Gamer Simulator,"Game Simulator fails at being what it states it is....a simulator.....heres why. For one the games are incredibly hard and frustrating, I should, as a gamer be able to easily clear them...secondly why are the food pick ups in the game within the game...they should be in the 'real world' where perhaps for food you have to call for pizza and wait, for the drink you have to hobble to the fridge....missed opportunity for this game. Overall very unrealistic.....well only realistic part is that its a console peasant starving and playing crappy games :)"

402220,Lift It, Early Access Review
402260,Dead Secret,"A good game but way too short and too easy, with the easiness componded by lame verbal clues all over the place. The storyline unfolds nicely and, unusally for a game of this type, I was actually interested in reading the texts scattered about (in some cases they are essential reading) but the only time I got stuck was due to a bug, which was resolved by a restart but led to wasted annoying minutes nonetheless. Not that I care much, but the achievements don't all show up (I got the 'correct' ending but it's not showing that I did). Maybe the primary aim is to showcase VR but in conventional mode you just feel this could have been more challenging and more than two or three hours gameplay for £11."

402620,Kindred Spirits on the Roof,"I really liked this VN. I enjoyed the progression system in the game, instead of making it completely linear it allows you to look at your planner and select which couples you'd prefer to continue with to a certain extent. So if you're like me and have a prefered couple, then you can complete as much of their story as you'd like until you had to complete the main storyline. I hope more VNs start to use this method.   Yes, there's nudity, but you can tell that it's not the main focus of this VN. The focus is telling the story of the couples. It's cute as hell."

402710,Osiris: New Dawn, Early Access Review
402750,Giant Machines 2017,"This game is ok, it should have a sandbox mode. Shuttle mission is very very very very very frustrating, as it takes a long time to complete. other than that. Good game"
402800,Chunks, Early Access Review
402840,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,"The devs made it overcomplicated for a idle game. The whole purpose of a idle clicker is to play it in between games, while your cs:go match is not ready or when your friend goes to the bathroom, and for that purpose, Crusader of the Lost Idols fails horribly. If you're willing to play it on hardcore mode (which I doubt) you'll may find it great. But if you are like me, and wants a nice game while your ranked dota match takes 10 min to find, this is the worst option possible. 3/10"
402850,Miner Mayhem,"Soooo... Someone made this, Like put effort into this game, and maybe was proud of it. And then I bought it. So I guess I'm the only one to blame for how I feel after playing this game.  If you want waste a dollar, I would say having more fun with it. For example you could buy a can of soda, or a candy bar. OR you could roll it up really tight bend over and shove it up yourself. All would be more enjoyable than this game.   10/10 would feel deep disappointment and regret again."
402880,Age of Barbarian Extended Cut,"hi, i dont appreciate, the sexism..."
402890,Nyctophilia,"Very creepy, very cool. Doesn't overstay its welcome, so the story remains effective the whole time. Great little game."
402980,Osteya,"Controls well, teleport mechanic allows for different sometimes much more efficient routes through levels. Its largely quite a solid platformer with a difficulty level I like, not too punishing but with the odd tricky spots.  That said, its very short, with quite a few levels being very similar to each other, and the teleportation isnt enough to make it stand out from being a very standard affair. (The sound also has some glitches where tracks play over each other, and the ending is just... odd.)  An hour of play in a very average platformer is simply nowhere near worth the nearly five pound entry fee. There are far better platformers for less money, and Id take a look at the £4 and under section of steam (Or even some free flash games.) before buying this.   If its on offer for a quid or so, grab a copy. Otherwise I cant recommend this."
40300,Risen,"This game is freakin awesome. I really like action style combat RPGs. Skill based. The PLAYER, not just the character, has to get good. YOU have to dodge stuff. And if you don't, you're dead. Doesn't hold your hand and is pretty difficult but I like that."
403040,Driver Booster 3 for STEAM,"Really useful software. I've been using it for a few months now and it's helped immensely.  Last month I changed my mobo, CPU, and GPUs. But some things were still just 'not right' even after I updated drivers manually. After updating my drivers with this, I had a HUGE jump in performance and less memory/CPU issues.  TIP - Go to SETTINGS &gt; GENERAL &gt; Only display drivers that pass WHQL tests. UNCHECK it. Made a lot of hardware that didn't work previously work, including a bluetooth adapter that came with my wireless card."
403100,Rescue Team 3,"6/10  This is not a 'micro manage your community' style game, although it looks like one at first.  I wanted to enjoy this game because I love micro managing little communities, upgrading structures, collecting supplies and all that typical stuff you expect from a game like this. But it is way too simple and there aren't any real options that seem to change the gameplay by any noteworthy amount. Really, the only thing that might be different on a second play through is how fast I complete each level, or meeting the criteria for an achievement. Otherwise, there is no structure placement, only stuctures that already exist which need repairs to function.  Its just too basic for me and everything is the game is predetermined. But if you like to get a game so that you can complete it with all achievements, then it might pose a challenge in that area.   You collect gold, wood, and food mostly because your characters need the supplies to do things. You click food supllies so you have the points to assign a character to collect wood, click a broken building when you have wood to repair it, click gold bars so you can assign someone to remove rocks, click wood again so you can assign someone to repair the fire station, click fire so the new fire station can send a guy to put the fire out, click food again, click gold bar, click wood, click building, level over.  On a positive note: The music aint horrible, the graphics are fair, and the interface is better than some."
403120,THE GAME OF LIFE ,"  I got this game as a gift from a friend for Christmas and I'm honestly not sure why it has such bad ratings. I played the physical board game of LIFE as a kid, I'm a massive fan of this game, which is why my friend got the computer version for me. This game is actually a really nice, relaxing way to spend an evening. It stays true to the original spirit of the board game and has added some creative minigames and a few extra features that weren't present in the original physical board game, which was a welcomed surprise for a seasoned player like myself. Oh, and major props for being able to choose your spouse's gender, regardless of your own gender. LGBT visibility is always a major selling point for me and I wasn't expecting that kind of progressiveness in a board game that was originally made in 1860, with the modern version we know today being released in 1960. Big thumbs up for that!  On top of the extra minigames and neat features, including being able to play online with your friends, it's just a really nice-looking game with a good soundtrack and cute cutscenes and animations for big events in the game, like getting married, graduating from university and having children. I found the entire thing really enjoyable and I was a bit sceptical going into it just because I am such a huge lifelong fan of The Game of LIFE and I didn't want to be disappointed. Not only was I not disappointed, I was actually pretty impressed. For the $5 it costs, it's a fantastic steal to add to your library if you're a fan of board games.  The only criticisms I can think of for it are when you're playing against computers, they can take their turns a bit too fast sometimes and I can't always follow exactly what they did on their turn. It would be nice if that was slowed down by just a couple seconds. Also, buying a house seems to be optional rather than mandatory in this version of the game. Not 100% sure if there was a rule change in 2016, my tabletop version of the game is a few years old by now.  Anyway, this game's bad ratings are completly unfair and silly. I don't understand it at all. If you like board games, definitely add this to your collection."
403180,Draw a Stickman: EPIC 2,"It's an awesome game. You get more colors than the first version. I just wish it were longer. Honestly I think #1 was a better version, but they gave different options in this one, so it is definitely worth purchasing both with the dlc."
403190,Planetbase,"Super game, very much, and I would like to buy it is not one person, I will hope that success will be! And so the game plus"
40320,Rush for Berlin: Gold Edition,"If you like RTS warfare with tanks and small squads of men then this is likely something you already have in your library, if not then you might have spoilt your appetite with other games that fit this genre. Personally it's a favourite in this kind of genre and unfortunely it only has spiritual successors since the developers now defunct.  Like I've said in another review, if I could jump into a time machine and intervene at the point of purchasing, I wouldn't intervene since it was worth every penny."
403200,Legends of Dawn Reborn,Nice to see Legends of Dawn back with some bug fix ! :) Nice work Dreamatrix and good luck for yours futures games !
403230,ZombieZoid® Zenith,"I have not yet completed this game yet so I might bring some more onto the review later!      Unique Art Stlye based on todays video games!    Quick and to the point for the reason why we have zombies everywhere!!! lol    Ability to find your grandpas tooth in a dungeon   The reason I followed this game is mainly the unique art style that we don't get in todays games, It's a nice fun game to play that you won't stress over!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2oPcg4OHxE "
403270,Cloudrift,omg i cant beleive i didnt know about this game i have a bunch of arcade machines including marble madness and havent been able to find a game that even remotely matches up to it until now ive been waiting for something like this my whole life i got 6th place on my second try and then took off my vive and started planning an arcade cabinet for this game with an led lit trackball but it works great with an xbox controller as well also its a more fleshed out game with huge replay value even if it didnt have one of the best global leaderboards ever that gives you high global scores at the bottom of the screen that tells you how close you are to moving up a spot its sheer genius 10/10 all day ill be playing this game the rest of my life chasing down corporatezombies 7 million score 
403290,Burly Men at Sea,"A calm, charming, and endearing adventure with a distinctive art style. I'm also a fan of the voiced 'sound effects' in the game. Very clever. Nicely done."
40330,Secret Files: Tunguska,"Classic point and click adventure, with a good story and logical puzzles!"
403300,GravBlocks,"It may not be the prettiest puzzle game out there, but the gameplay is solid and even more, addictive. Should've called Zen Mode 'Crack Mode' instead. Can be crazy challenging."
403390,Undercover Missions: Operation Kursk K-141,My God this game is slow its like watching paint dry visited every item and place in the first room and still cant get out the room and she moves so slowly its like an old 60's game wish Id never bothered..... overpriced
40340,Secret Files: Puritas Cordis,"They replaced the entire voice cast in the second installment. Didn't help. The same voiceover problems, both artistical and technical. The lead actress's attempts at dramatism are simply pathetic. On top of it, most of the object interactions still heavily utilize the 'quest logic' instead of... well... logic, forcing you not to think but brute force everything until you stumble upon a solution. Sorry, but still no recommendation from me..."
403400,ARCADE GAME SERIES: DIG DUG,Well hey it takes up way more space than it should and you can probably get it for even less   but it works and I lost all of my other namco ports so what the heck  It's fun to sadistically inflate things until they explode   
403410,ARCADE GAME SERIES: Ms. PAC-MAN,"Deadzone issues make this unplayable with a controller. Ms. Pac-Man constantly moves to the right if I'm not moving the control stick in another direction, and going up only works half the time as the right movement constantly overrides it. No actual control options so I can't just remap movement to the D-Pad to fix this. Game came out in April 2016 so it's obviously not getting fixed at this point. Avoid."
403430,ARCADE GAME SERIES: GALAGA,"Galaga!!  This port of the classic arcade game has matched absolutely well. I've played before the emulation of this game through MAME many years back and have even played on a true cabinet a couple times. This PC port matches just about every bit of the original arcade version, nigh perfection. What's really not to like about that?  Port it on over to Steam, give it some achievements to unlock, some nice background artwork and keep the game intact! That's how you do ports.  Heavily recommended if you adore arcade classics like good ol' Galaga!"
403460,SkyScrappers,"At first, SkyScrappers looked like a lot of fun for a couch gaming session with friends, but it is more like gambling with friends, because the only thing you do is button smashing for attacks. Jumping on some of the objects is also very random, because you are able to jump on some pieces of the collapsing tower but these spots aren't highlighted in any way. The animations are very special too, they are very unsmooth you never know, which attack you are currently making."
403490,Lands of Hope Redemption,"Let us look at this in perspective, for a moment. A small indie team made an actually decent experience that works as intended most of the time. To that end, it's better than a lot of stuff on steam. For $1.99, if you really want a cheap mmo experience, LOHR is worth two dollars.  That being said, there's some critical flaws here that need to be addressed.     One, the game is brutally unforgiving. I got murdered in one hit by a monster my level.      The game is positively begging you for money at every turn. Strong boxes need purchased keys, avatars need buying, and even premium classes. This starts on tutorial island and does not stop.     The level design feels directionless and meandering.      No real game tutorial for a new combat system   Did they achieve something pretty cool? Yeah, actually, they did. Is it worth paying money for? Well, see, I have a rule. If you're charging me for the game up front, you don't get to ask for microtransactions. So, no, this game is not worth it at this juncture."
40350,Lost Horizon,"A great game and artwork, the engine is later used in The Secret Files 3, but its a great story and fun game if you give it a chance."
403510,Fairy Tale Mysteries 2: The Beanstalk,"I like this game and it's okay, except the mini game, the Cauldron - ROSEMARY and the herbs that I didn't get it, what I followed the rules, and it didn't work out for me. So, I skip it. I like this game, but it's too hard for me. I keep on playing my game."
403560,Eaten Alive,Only thing you can expect in this game is Trading cards
403590,Klepto, Early Access Review
403640,Dishonored 2,"When I got dishonored 2 I knew exactly what I was going to get from it. I knew how corvo saved Emily in the first game and how the entire story was most likely going to play out in the second. I was going to play the first mission of dishonored 2 and then move onto writing part of my review for this game but little did I know that it had been 10pm at night and I had no need to review something at that time. Then 30 hours later my second play through is done and I haveplayed both characters and loved the story both times I played as of how its pleasant surprises and choices that you make matter to the outcome of not only the ending but the whole next mission can play fascinated me as it was the exact same game dishonored 1 was only made better with more storyline new characters which made it one of my greatest moments of artistry in gaming that really shine. I love dishonored 2 and will continue to play it along side the first of its series, embracing the unique and vast world of the Isles and its peculiar cast of characters in the games. But dishonored 2 builds off of and improves on both story and gameplay that dishonored 1 had presented us with. Which is why I can comfortable place a good review for a game that was so much money to buy but it was all worth it to me. :)"
403660,Omnipresent,"The UI is rather janky and there are some minor bugs, but both are predictable enough to deal with. Once I got used to them I found myself entertained. It's not an incredibly deep game, and no individual part is very complex, but all the little pieces come together pretty well. At first it seemed like another game called Endgame: Singularity (not on Steam), but it's more like its opposite - there's a lot less numbers and levelling and an actual plot in this one. The plot itself is pretty linear but you have a decent amount of freedom to accomplish many of the individual tasks, even if the game doesn't always make some of the concepts involved very clear.  It took me an evening or two to reach one ending, and there's a secret or two and a bunch of background filler for those who like to explore."
403670,Lumber Island - That Special Place,"This game isn't bad, however that doesn't make it good.  It's got twists and turns that make sense and the notes explain what is going on nicely.  The main issue with this game is that it has little direction. You could be walking around an area for 10-30 minutes before realizing what you're supposed to do. The first level handles this nicely, but the rest are confusing and lack of quick-saves or save points in general make this frustrating.  It eventually turns into a trial and error game that loses all of it's fun. As much as I don't want to recommend this game, I have to. It has a decent story and the only issue I had was it's sense of direction.  I'd recommend this game if you could pick it up on a sale, It has about an hour of content with it."
403690,Codename: Rogue Fleet,"It is a great game ! It only needs minor improvements and fixes, in the earth graphics, the controls in my opinion are good, the ships are great and their variety is really good, I only complain about the lack of players, this is a game to appreciate, and some fixing in the ships and more battle modes would make this game AWESOME!"
403700,Zero Punctuation: Hatfall - Hatters Gonna Hat Edition,"At first it doesn't seem like there's a terrible amount of substance to this game, but it has just the right amount of mini-games, rewards, store options and just the right difficulty to keep you coming back.  I rate they did a cracker job"
403740,GabeN: The Final Decision,THATS MY GAME :)
403780,Color Symphony 2,"It's like Super Meat Boy, but more innovative, worse music, more pretentious story, and less slidey controls."
40380,Nail'd,Great game if I could get that resolution setting to save ... I have no clue how to save the setting .
403830,The Consuming Shadow,"Very vauge story line, and wasn't clear on what the player was suppose to do. A lot of reading, and that can be very difficult to undestand when, you trying to figure out what this game is all about. If your into spoky, story lines, then this is the game for you, but i wasn't all that thrilled about it."

403880,MotoGP™15 Compact,have to say it this game is awesome to play no problems so far..im using on my pc ...  thx; MotoGP an Steam
403900,Clergy Splode,"I can't recommend this game. In this game you need to complete different objectives and to do that you'll have to kill zombies. Bad graphics, music is bad. I played and finished it because I am a completionist. I rate this game   5/10  ."
403950,Conquest of Elysium 4,"A great game, however, there are faults and I have to mark this game as a negative till then. My main point will no doubt make people mark this as not helpful since its minor in the grand scheme of the game.  Before anything else, there are plenty of pros compared to CoE3:    Way better music    Vastly improved UI    Planes add an interesting element    New everything: spells, monsters, etc    Now onto the main con. If you're wanting to play this game with friends, then you have to use hamachi like services (I've tried countless p2p programs and they all suck, and even then, no one likes using hamachi) that allow peer 2 peer without port forwarding. Or, if able you have to port forward. This is my primary, huge con. The developers simply won't budge on using steam's api to allow p2p connecting and that is just a huge drawback to me. I was hoping it would of been an improvement and a step up from CoE4 but atlast, CoE4 just doesn't have it. Is this probably unfair to the whole game? Perhaps. But multiplayer is what makes this game fun and until its easily accessible without jumping through needless hoops, my review will hold a negative till then.   Cons   TCP/IP Connection only support (No peer 2 peer)     No modding support     Some UI is still clunky (Exit ingame quits entirely? Uhhh okay then..)   Some races just arn't balanced and rely on extreme RNG.    No manual control in battle    There should be an after battle stats report along with viewing what happened.    If you plan on playing just single player, go for it, no reason not to get this if you've liked CoE3. However, seeing how this is an entirely different version from CoE3, and warrants a price tag. I expect majors in not only the gameplay (Which, they've successfull) but in the overall game/engine itself. There are simply not enough improvents to warrant an entirely different version instead they could of added it as dlc (While everyone would prefer free, its understandable for dlc) for the previous version."
403970,The Dwarves,"This game is great. its tough, or im just bad at it. If i heard about this game before i would have donated to the Kickstarter, becuase i love the books. It's has a great story, fun combat, and fun tactical gameplay."
403980,World Ship Simulator, Early Access Review
40400,AI War: Fleet Command,Boo. I have been wanting this game for a long time. I thought it would be amazing to play an rts that used the same sprites as one of my favorite games Tyrian. However in practice the game falls sadly short. The only good thing is that it only cost 1.79. Well for those that enjoy it good for you... For those that are looking for any kind of single player experience go somewhere else.
404030,Lucky Rabbit Reflex!,"Love it ! Great example of a really good otome game. Shame that not all are like this. Very funny. FULL of Surprises. Great characters. Challenging but overall fun coming up with strategies.  Time flies with this one, my only regret is I didn't catch it on SALE !"
404050,Black & White Bushido,"'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Bull ♥♥♥♥.'  - me after losing a cap to a hidden friend   Think Samurai Gunn with a team-based light/shadow stealth element and capture the flag on top. Double jumping, wall jumping, aerial and rush attacks, slinking into the light or shadow, caltrops, shurikens, smoke bombs... tons of fun locally with four players (no online play)! The single-player challenge mode is great but the real meat is in multiplayer."
404080,Murder,"  I loved the ambience because it reminded me of Blade Runner (the movie). But by the time the credits rolled (for the second time), I was left thinking 'what'? I don't mind short stories or games. I liked 'Three fourths home' which, granted, is a bit longer, but my problem with Murder is that it didn't give me anything to work with. Great graphics and music, but.. wth? I'm glad I tried it, and I got it as a code in a gaming event, but I really wish the game had double the depth, if not the length."
404100,STEEL STRIDER,"Controls are broken to the point that the game is unplayable. Screen modes are 640x480 and 1024x768. (That's it.) Fullscreen disables aero and resizes the desktop, which scrambles my desktop organization.  It's 2015. This ♥♥♥♥ is not ♥♥♥♥ing acceptable, and this title is the last straw. I've filed for a refund and will never again purchase a game from ASTRO PORT. It's just overwhelmingly clear that they simply don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their work."
404180,Club Life, This game makes up for the time when I didn't ask that special girl to prom back in high school.
40420,Tidalis,Valve can only dream about games this good.
404270,All My Gods,"I've also got an odd fondness for these kinds of games, much to no one's surprise. They're light city builders where you gather resources, accomplish assigned tasks, and repeat until near the end game where there's a huge ♥♥♥♥ing bottleneck and progress halts almost completely. They're mobile games at heart and the 'hey buy some premium currency to continue playing the game' structure of them really shows even though there is no premium currency found in the PC version of these games. Which really underscores the kind of despicable and broken nature of mobile gaming in general if you stop to think about it, I guess.  I feel like this game is not as good as some of the others I've played (The Happy Hereafter, The Tribez), but it's reasonably passable. I'll be farting my way through it in the morning before work probably just because it's low commitment and takes next to no thought."
404400,BADBLOOD,"BADBLOOD is broken for quite a number of players. In many cases the game won't launch but registers as running. In the Dev's defence they have sent these people direct download links.  However, in my case, the game was frozen in my update queu, would not update, and required me to close Steam via the task manager every time I wanted to quit. This has only been resolved through deleting the appmanifest and a bunch of the files. The Application cannot be removed as it is 'running'. I can't find the process anywhere if this is actually the case.  This massive problem has been around for some time and has still not been resolved. Given that this is not an early access game, and is a full release, this is unnacceptable.  I will, of course, remove this review in the event that this bug is resolved. However failing that I feel that the dev has had plenty of time to resolve this issue that effects people who are not even playing the game."
404410,Endless Sky,"A somewhat text-oriented game where you transport goods and people around the galaxy. Occasionally you get attacked by pirate fleets. Happens more often in uninhabited star systems. You can choose to go for a career in piracy too, but I haven't done that.  + Free and open source! + Enjoyable writing. There are many planets, and each one has a description (along with a nice photograph) that details what kind of place it is. Also, the game follows a storyline, but I haven't had much opportunity in exploring that yet, even though several in-game years have passed. I don't know if I've reached its end, as it could be incomplete. Apparently, more storylines are on the way. + You're given a lot of options for customizing your ships. + Very relaxed game. After paying off your initial loan, you won't have much financial trouble. Paying the salaries of your crew (if you choose to have a fleet) isn't difficult. + The assets are all in open formats, so they're easily moddable. But if you want to create new content instead of changing existing stuff,  Check out the wiki!  [github.com]   - Not really a problem but I should still list this: There is no music. But if you're the kind of person to be bothered by a lack of music, you probably have a playlist suitable for this game already. If not, start making one! - Although your options for customizing ships are many like I said before, the hulls don't allow many modifications to one ship. Which is a good thing because you can't just slap every nice thing on your ship and go destroy the galaxy, but it does feel a bit limiting. - The gameplay mechanics are a bit  shallow , but they aren't  bad . It's not a huge issue for a game that doesn't aim for hundreds of hours of playtime.  Overall, if you like captaining or exploration, give this game a try."
404420,Sun Dogs,"It’s not just incomplete; it’s barely been started. It’s a $10 smokescreen obscuring the cavities where its gameplay, narrative, and atmosphere should have been.  Full review:  http://www.darkstation.com/reviews/sun-dogs/ "

404480,SC2VN - The eSports Visual Novel,"Nice Game, Nice Story, Nice Graphics!"
404510,Heaven's Hope,"  Heaven’s Hope is an adventure, point &amp; click that follows the story of a fallen angel by the name of Talorel, who is looking for his way back to Heaven. When I saw this game I was intrigued by the hand painted scenes and was reminded of some of my favourite adventure games, such as Simon The Sorcerer and my absolute favourite game The Longest Journey. With this nostalgia in mind I really wanted to try this game out and unfortunately it didn’t live up to my expectations.  The highest point of this game is its graphics, it is beautifully presented, the visuals are top quality. With most adventure point and click games, it has the perspective of 2.5D, the illusion of 3D with 2D graphics. They have pulled this off really well with the larger foreground, but without so much detail that you are inclined to look at that instead of what is happening in the middle ground. Alongside this the animations of people talking, although they are repetitive they fit with the style and some are quite humorous. However on the flip side when things take a darker turn it reminded me a lot of The Cat lady, with the warped and distorted animations.  The beautiful graphics however were let down by the story itself, when I started the game it was a really interesting concept and some bemusing things happened to keep me intrigued. However after about 3 hours of game play the story became stale, it felt like it wasn’t trying very hard to keep my interest and I was quickly getting bored. Though the puzzles were of average difficulty (some being quite easy to figure out, whilst others took a while longer) some were illogical, I couldn’t get the answer because the answer just didn’t make sense to me. This often resulted in trying to combine everything I had in my inventory with each other till I got something and even then I was confused with how the game came to that conclusion.  After hitting the 5 hour mark, I thought I had been playing much longer and it was at this point that I couldn’t actually recall hearing any music in the game. I played for a while longer and there was indeed music but that meant the music was easily forgettable. This in my opinion is a problem when you create an adventure game, music is everything as it sets the mood and the most magical moments I’ve had in adventure games, have had extremely touching music along side the events that were unfolding.

404690,This Book Is A Dungeon,"I liked This Book Is A Dungeon, despite some of its flaws. I really liked the art in the game, it's one of the things that originally caught my interest. My biggest complaint is the lack of a proper save system, so if you die you have to play through alot of your progress to get back to where you were. Despite this I did play again to get all endings, which I don't usually do but with this game I felt compelled to. A short game I definitely recommend, especially if it's on sale."

404750,Carrotting Brain, Early Access Review
404790,Godot Engine,"Amazing engine, but there's no point in getting the Steam version since it doesn't actually log your hours while developing; only at the project screen.  You're better off grabbing the non-Steam version on  godotengine.org , especially since Godot's 32bit version is the only version available on Steam at the time of this review.  Otherwise, this software is amazing."
404820,Ragdoll Runners,"The mechanics, the graphics, everything about this game is not what I expected. It just needs to be...better...? Would MAYBE pay $0.99 for this but definitely not worth $5... Not my thing, not fun at all.  11/10 would refund.  Edit: Dev politely pointed me to their 'Free web demo'. I completely missed that in the game description. I HIGHLY recommend everyone try it before they buy this game. It's essentially the same ♥♥♥♥ game."
404850,DARTHY,The greatest game ever made!   Edit: There's no bias with this review; I swear.
404860,Inside Me,"Alright let me get the good out of the way because ther's a lot to talk about:  First, the gameplay, two thumbs up for me. I found that if you're dying over and over again, there's somthing you're not doing right, you need ALL the ablilities and firepower you can get, unlike a lot of games where it kinda just remains unused until a hard boss fight where you go 'oh that's right i had THIS power'. You need everything you can to survie, and it shows a lot of thought and testing went into it.  Second, the horde mode i found to be fun. Not the best one i've ever played, but fun. Enjoyable, play the story missions up to the last one before horde mode otherwise you won't know what you're doing.   Lastly, the boss fights, i loved them. They really do make you use everything you've learnt up to that point to just try to stay alive, and if you want to beat it, you're gonna need to figure out a way. It's so satisfying to beat them however, unlike a lot of games where the boss is a bullet sponge and can't really hurt you unless you're in the way of it's one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t attack.  BUT if I had one MAJOR complaint about this game (and I do) it's this: what seems to be the last level is absolute  garbage  and it made me not want to play the game ever again.   Now, I'll block out the spoiler, up to you if you want to read it, but if you don't want anything spoiled let me just say this: the last level wasn't 'too difficult' I went into it wanting a really meaty challenge, but that isn't what the last level is, instead, it's just trolling the player.     so for the last level (from what i could tell i couldn't get past it) all of your abilities and powers except for a shield are taken away. Instead it turns into a survival horror maze game where you have to get a bunch of glowy balls to put into a big glowy ball in the center of the maze. You start in the center, and have to explore the surrounding maze to find the glowy balls. In the maze are insta-death monsters who screech really loudly and are essentially a jumpscare death. You have a flashlight to see the monsters ahead of you, because otherwise you can only see a small radius around you, but they can also see the flashlight and will chase you. Also they're much faster, so it isn't as much of a chase as it is a split second telling you that you ♥♥♥♥ed up. It wasn't hard, it was frustrating and just plain not fun. I hate games who's end challenge is a different set of gameplay from the rest of the game. And I hate mazes, and I hate insta-death, super fast enemies, and I hate fetch quests, so the last level is all of that rolled together. Oh, and you have to gather 5 balls without one ♥♥♥♥-up, if you do, you start all over.     All in all, really fun, worth the buy, last level can suck on a hairy, sweaty, smegma covered nutsack."
40500,Sacraboar,"You can't beat the computer, it clicks faster than you. You only have 6 units and a set amount of gold which replenishes instantly upon losing a unit. I don't recommend this game"
405000,UTOPIA 9 - A Volatile Vacation,"I enjoyed this game, but now what? Finished it with both unlockable characters.   Am I blind? Is there another character? Another game mode?   Not nearly enough variety for replayability. Its also a little slow for a shooter. The nemsis system is lackluster replacment for decent (and varied) boss battles.  It was fun while it lasted and it was inexpensive, but I would stick with the awesomely varied and difficult Nuclear Throne, or the now classic Binding of Isaac. There is no itch that this game scratches that isn't scratched better by another game."
405010,Bitardia, Early Access Review
405050,Fill Up!,"One of the worst games I've ever played. After nearly 13 years of gaming this game is one of those games I will highlight in the High Score of the worst games at rank 1. The idea could have come from a developer out of the 80's. Someone who is thrown into the nice world of creating games. But for now we are lot's of years later. And people can compare their work with the once from the others.   If this game would only come with a catchy art work. But not even this. The graphics are poor, the sound horrowable, the mechanics inexistent. Pulling cars from the track to the refill station and wait till you grinded enough money to upgrade your tankstation to been able to refill the next cars. And so far I have to rate this game with at least 1 out of 10. Because the creator didn't lie when he named his game 'Fill Up!'. You wont do anything else. But 2,99 Bucks for a concept of game isn't worth at all. Not even gifted!"
405070,The Worm,The Nokia 3510 version was better
405180,123 Slaughter Me Street,bad very bad. the game is to lagy and i cant beat floor 7!!!! it whould be awsome if u can fix this problem. EDIT: (also on floor 7 when the follower is like far away and the player is getting out of floor 7 then the follower killes you. ) why???
405310,LEGO® MARVEL's Avengers,7.5/10 good game 1/10 when using mouse and keyboard
405370,Sky Break,"Very good game in my opinion. I love everything about it but it needs a bit more. It's too easy to beat the game and then your left with nothing to do but unlock the rest of the mech slots and tame new animals, mabye just go around and shoot everything or try to max out your upgrades but after that the fun is over. Theres not enough content to be able to do much. It would be great if you could build your own base or if there was more to explore. A co-op mode would be fun. I really like this game and come back to it just to mess around every once in a while but its a bit bare. I still recomend this game though because its still alot of fun even if the fun dosent last very long. And to the devs I really like this game but please do try to add more to this game, even just a co-op mode where you could go out with your friends and screw around would be fun."
405440,Ares Omega,"it would be an acceptable game for ~£1 really no more at all. accuracy is shocking, speed of your character is also shocking feels slow to respond and can feel like youre moving through treacle."
405500,Dangerous Golf,"It's amazing if you're looking for pure destruction. It deserves far better than it's current mixed rating.  Personally, I don't think a controllers necessary; helpful, but not necessary."
405530,Veer, Early Access Review
405540,Ninja Senki DX,"This game looked cool, but unfortunately poor level design generally prevents it from being very fun. The mechanics of this game are extremely limited (you have jump, double jump, and shoot, and that's it), and the levels themselves are also very linear and filled with pixel perfect jumps and cheesy instant kills. This generally means there's only one way to handle any given situation, which causes the game to feel repetitive and eliminates any potential for skillful play. On top of this, the enemies in the game also generally take way too many shots, which also makes the game feel fairly slow-paced and button-mashy.  This game tries to be a throwback to Gameboy Color, but it possesses no interesting mechanics and would be a fairly mediocre game even if it had been released on that system (comparing this to, say, the GBC Goemon game really drives this point home). It's a shame, too, because the game does possess moments where you can see there was some potential (for example, during the boss fights, which actually allow some degree of freedom and are generally the highlight of the game), but these moments are few and far between."
405550,Jet Set Knights,Its honestly horrible when you go up through a platform and expect to beable to go back down you are left dissapointing and it feels a bit too much liek yo uare a rock with the gravity in this game and seeing as the main way of attack is jumping on enemies for a 1 hit kill and soem 3 hit or shoot a crap ton of arrows and hope of hitting or cut em a bunch with a sword. It may just be that this is just not the game for m. Im a bit used to being floaty .
405590,Stone Tales,"I got this game as a pack of 10 random keys. It looked the most promising among them, because of its interesting art style. I've never been this wrong, in all my life. The graphics, interface, and menus look like its a cheap mobile import and the controls are made by the devil. With only six levels its a rather short game, but its more than enough because you will get bored after a half of the first level."
405610,Flight of the Paladin,This game takes some time to get used to. The music is great and the graphics are fine but the controls are hard... very hard. As much as the game itself is too. At some stage it seems impossible to get further on in the campaign or the additional survival mode that has been included. If you buy the game on sale its worth spending a little bit of time on it though for the full price I would not recommend it because it gets very repetitive after a while.
405640,Pony Island,Had a good time with this one.
405650,Zero Reflex,"I bought this game for the high difficulty. But the way they made the difficult was not what i expected.  if you get a game over, you will go back sevral levels. the higher de difficult the more levels you go back, faster the game is and the less lives you have.  the attackpatren of the ennemy doesnt even change, It is always the same. That is what I call: Fake difficulty."
405670,Combat Core, Early Access Review
405720,Perfect Universe,"Review based on free key won on Steamgifts. Perfect Universe = physics puzzle-solving platformer with many extra features  Pros:  - minimalist visuals - small learning curve - wide variety of games, puzzles and objectives - different multiplayer games - levels are short = easy to bang out a few levels and walk away Cons:  - Spanish Prisoner  - Pig in a poke - White-van speakers  Overall: A relaxing and enjoyable time killer. I'll will be trying to finish the game, but I think it will take more than a few sessions. And I'll try to 'con' a couple of my buddies into buying this, so we can make use of the multiplayer games."
405760,Robot Squad Simulator 2017,  Hi! My name's Sasha Zenko. I'm from Belarus.  I am making hardcore letsplay videos handsfree (using only my chin).  I have a program that allows me to assign keyboard controls to mouse movements.  I play your game. It's very good. I like it.  Watch me playing your game without hands here:         YouTube™ Video:  Robot Squad Simulator 2017&nbsp;
405780,Alpha Polaris : A Horror Adventure Game,"This game is a good game for a few hours of fun. Getting this game for sale is the only thing that made it worth it for me.  The game has a brilliant premise and the story at the first half is laid out well with the first puzzle being easy enough to get used to controls and latteral thinking but not too simple to bore the player in the beggining. the first half of the game until you go off base (intentionally left vague as to not spoil the game) is brilliantly structured and is interesting. The dream states are curious and are actually disturbing thereby contributing to the horror aspect.   The middle however. How in the blazes do you eplain that.  The middle is like the roller coaster you get taken up hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh and then you hit the drop. FAST. it went down hill faster than a pigeon who suddenly had a bowling ball teleported into it's stomach.   The story basically deterioted after the middle. the characters seem mundane, the story just has everything hit the fan at once. it just seemed to finish too quickly as if they ran out of time, this game honestly just needed a few months extra work at the end but like college students they blew the end of the game.   NOT TO MENTION THE RANDOM SEX SCENE  Yes you read that right, there is a random sex scene between the protagonists. This is not really a problem other than the fact that it is very well illustrated but that one of the main protagonists who is displayed as self sufficient and being incredibly strong minded actually becomes the helpless woman in the end.  The cotrols are intuitive and are easily understood. The puzzles do require lateral thinking but are not unamanageable.  In conclusion MEH. "
405810,Valzar,Really nice background art but the characters are really simple and lacking. Really they look like the most basic pixel art you can imagine. Animations are ok. The platforming controls are ok for the most part but it's hard to control your jump height. The level design isn't very thought out. Obviously its randomly generated so that may be part of the problem. It's also very frustrating when you die from an unavoidable hit and then you have to start ALLLLL over.
405820,Turok,"Wow, this game hasn't aged well at all. The movement feels very slidy and sluggish, the monsters rather on the dull side, and the level design very uninteresting. If you're looking for a classic shooter, try something like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D or Quake 2. Only bother springing for this if you are very nostalgic for the N64 days."
405860,Super Ubie Island REMIX,"Nice aesthetics and the gameplay feels pretty good, yet I can't recommend this game, mainly due to how generic it feels. If this was my first touch with platforming games the story might be different, but as a child of the 90s I don't see much reason to play these kinds of games when I've already played the games that inspired these games.  One might say that I didn't give it enough of a chance by only playing through the first two levels, but actually installing and starting the game is giving it a fair chance in my opinion; I've shown interest and now the game just needs to hook me. Which this one sadly failed to do."
405900,Disgaea PC,"I'm seriously disappointed in this game's performance, both FPS wise and bug wise. The game is already slow enough as is at full FPS (when playing on the PS2), so running the game at 1/2 speed is very annoying. I've also tried using Pretty Prinny (a third party enhancement mod designed to 'fix' issues) only to no avail. Instead of adding new things like Pleinair and Adell / Rozalin, how about actually spending some quality time fixing the game's engine? This game runs worse than PS2 emulators, how can you even do That bad?"
405950,Lowglow,"this is seriously one of the best puzzle games I have ever come across before. It's pretty unique and has a very interesting story line. However, the story itself seems pretty short and the achievements are pretty simple and few.  I would recommend this game at its current price and getting it on sale is one hell of a bonus"
405960,Sunken,"Sunken is amazing RPG game, very similar to Diablo II.It was hard for me at start because I'am usually playing FPS games, so if you like RPG titles I recommend this.You'll love it and enjoy it."

406110,Asdivine Hearts,"This is what happens when you take a 5 hour game and stretch it into 30 hours.  Terribly repetitive. The combat, the locations, the lame jokes... You'll see and hear it all within the first 5 hours. Then it's recycled and thrown at you again and again and again. What a grinder."
406120,Astral Breakers,This was pretty cool!
406130,DarkMaus,I really liked this game. Wide choice of weapons too. It's got a steep learning curve and you have to learn each enemies tactics; so expect to die over and over. 
406150,Refunct,"I cannot say that this is a bad game, because it's not. But I can't say that is worth what you pay for it though, beacuse it lasts like 30-minuts, platinum achievement included (I even tried to see if there was something else to do, but the answer is no, there's not.) Buy it if you find it for sale and you are not too pretentious, it will maybe surprise you more than it surprised me"

406290,Twilight Struggle,"If you like luck in a boardgame, this one might be for you. Otherwise stay away from it.  In general the computer adaptation is fine, but the boardgame is heavily skewed towards luck. So as long as you mind losing a game, in which you played fine, I recommened not to play this."

406550,Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"Deeply unsettling, with a fascinating story and music that lends itself to a powerful atmosphere, Umineko is insanely compelling. However, I would not recommend playing this at night, or without a wall to your back."
406650,Ratings War,"A well-written choose your own advenure that will especially appeal to anyone who enjoys the Cyberpunk genre. Very Shadowrun feel to the story itself, sans the meta-races. However, I didn't develop the same attachment to my character or the supporting cast that I did in Choice of Robots or Tin Star as examples. It might have been that as a reporter, my character was more of a story observer than a story maker. I also felt like some of the plot itself was contrived and more fed to me as a reader than something that developed through choice-based play. I consider it a decent product for its price."
406690,Roses and Gems, Early Access Review
406720,Alekhine's Gun,"I don't know why didn't I listened to the reviews and simply abstained myself from buying this game.  I play through the first mission and it was terrible in everyway, even moving something like the camera felt slow, and sluggish, and unresponsive, and ugly, and frustrating.  Pair that up with the fact the entire ui is extremely clumbersome and confusing and then you got a recipe for a game that's not only shallow and boring to play but also messy, and this mess is not only reserved for the ui and the gameplay mechanics. One of the most glaring problems that I found when playing the game is simply that the game, besides the objectives, doesn't have anything interesting in the freaking first level, the clear representation on how a game is supposed to be 'played out' eventually. Gradually adding more and more depht that you experience from the beginning, up until the end.  A lot of games seem to do that very well, but I can just now help but wonder in this game what the second mission might improve upon the first one, is it going to add different methods for me to murder mi targets besides the one that's been the same from the first mission?  But in reality what made me quit the game and simply request a refund was how horrible the performance of this game is, I can stand a bad game, I really can, I even liked a lot of the 'Army of men' games, what I can't tolerate its a game that attempts to copy another game (Hitman) and ends up misrepresenting everything that makes those games great, while at the same time having the audacity to work whenever it feels like.  I don't recommend this game, not now, not in the future, not ever, not when its on sale, certainly not when its full priced, just strafe away from this game, listen to the reviews, and understand there's nothing that this game offers that you can't probably find in other games, even in the prior 'Death to Spies' games, haven't even played those, but have heard of them... So they can't be bad, Right?"

406870,Eventide: Slavic Fable,"This game was pretty great! I've payed a few hidden object games before, and one of the appeals is that most are free. This is worth the purchase because there is a bit more to it than the standard hidden object. Find out for yourself when you purchase it!"
406920,Monsterland,"TL;DR: If you'rel looking for an ASCII Rogue-like, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a fun action game, check this one out.  While this game is pretty fun and fantastic, don't mistake it for the classic ASCII games of yore (ZZT, ADOM, etc). This game plays out way more like a twin-stick arcade game that's been run through AALIB. It's a cool idea, but the whole thing just feels too fluid and real-time for an ASCII-style game.  Is it worth it? Absolutely. The game is fun, there's a lot fun. Basically imagine it as DOOM, but re-created as an arcade game and rendered entirely as an ASCII map.  I wish there was more variation in monsters - so far everything is just the letter M in various colours. There isn't even any indication on what each monster is... I guess you can use your imagination more there."
406930,Epic Showdown,"Epic Showdown ----------------  Forgot what the reviewers say! This game is amazing.  The gameplay might not look the best, the graphics might not look the best. You have to play the game for yourself, trust me.  If I listened to what these disgusting reviewer trolls said, and well they're just disgusting trolls.  They're trying to tarnish this game's reputation.   This game is so cheap! Literally it's $0.99!!!  This game should be the full $59.99 like most TripleA games. You're getting an amazing deal. This game isn't bad, it's just painted to be that way.   I would right a longer review, however I have to get back to playing the game! It's that good.

406970,The Uncertain: Last Quiet Day,"I like all the little things in the game, and love the story, yes it reminds me of Telltale's interactive stories, but that is not a bad thing, .. I Love my FPS games, but it's nice to slow things down now and then for a good story :) Keep up the good Work,, I'm already wanting part 2 and a part 3, 4, 5"
40700,Machinarium,"All the games I've played from this company are incredibly imaginative, creative and adorable. Like being immersed in one of those gentle, dreamlike, Oscar-winning animated shorts from Eastern Europe. Wonderful soundtracks too. I'm not a very experienced gamer and found I needed to refer to hints and walkthroughs, as some sections can be frustratingly logic-defying."
407000,Survival Is Not Enough, Early Access Review
407020,Star Sky,"I'm not sure I'd call it a game but I enjoyed it a short chill-out experience with nicely drawn minimalist graphics. while there isn't much overt story, it'll keep me occupied wondering what the heck is going on for a while. it is a good choice to unwind as nothing stressful happens whatsoever, although you could interpret the story in creepy ways. it does a good job of simulating a walk at night when you can't quite tell what things are, or a pleasant but confusing dream. the achievements took me a bit of thinking to work out and I think one was slightly bugged.  I can see how it might mess up the game to be able to go backwards, as there are very specific triggers and the logic would get confused by being able to go back and redo things in a different order, but I still would like there to be a wider margin of error with triggering things. sometimes I don't hear the event music in time and don't manage to stand in the exact right place."
407060,AltspaceVR,Nice place to meet up with other users and hang out. It does get boring if you are looking for more than talking to other people.

407190,Club Manager 2016,NOTE: I was given a review key for this game.  GAMETIME: There's a choice of watching video highlights of key moments during a match or a top-down foosball/pinball style view of the whole match with 3 speed variations.  MANAGER: Easy to use menus and UI with lots of options for club managers of all ages.  GRAPHICS: 1080p resolution is not very optimized &amp; needs some bugs fixed. For example: At 1080p resolution my mouse was limited to 720p movement. Couldn't figure why it was doing that.  AUDIO: Great choice of music which doesn't get repetitive.

407230,Legend of Mysteria,"Legend of Mysteria RPG is a prequel to the Labyronia saga.  It has great a great storyline and BGM, however the amount of walking around the same areas you do is very tedious. From my expierence i was following the story perfectly and suddenly a ceratin action couldn't be triggered to free a character out of prison. Which pretty much forces you to restart the game again to get to that point. Which i didn't do.  Overall, It's a pretty alright RPG maker game. Would i recommend it? Yes, pretty sure an error wont happen to everyone, i might have not been an error from the side of the game but rather an error in my playthrough. Maybe you should give it a shot."
407290,There Was a Caveman,In the small time that I have played this game I could already tell that this game is going to be a blast. You can tell the developer worked really hard on this and to top it off there are achivements and trading cards added! Great platformer right here.
407300,The Last NightMary - A Lenda do Cabeça de Cuia,This is a pretty cool little game. Good horror atmosphere. Definitely turn out the lights and use headphones.  It'll take couple of hours if you want to get ALL the content. All the achievements? Be ready for a grind.
407320,My Little Kitties,not what i expected.... suuuper short.
407330,Sakura Dungeon,"First download the censorship removing patch. Then play to unlock the pics. Average dungeon crawler, nice pictures. If you like nudity and lesbians and simple rpgs this is it. Only problem was that all the girls look exactly the same."
407340,Strawberry Vinegar,"I love this game to pieces. It's a nice little game about a nine year old girl, far too mature and cynical for her age, who gets forced into cooking for a little demon. The writing is great, providing both charming characters and fun humor, as well as descriptions of food that makes you want to try eat the screen. As a slice-of-life VN it works really great, and the epilogues were surprisingly rewarding. (Wish there was more epilogue, I want to see even more of that romance.)   One thing I personally would want to highlight is the parents of the main characters and the relationship they share. The mother and father are living in a BDSM relationship that seems to impact every aspect of their everyday life, something their daughter notices and reflects on. The father is really submissive, and basically functions as a cute housewife living to serve his mistress. The childs perspective on their parents BDSM relationship is really interesting in itself, and her insight provides some character growth to her parents. I really wasn't expecting this from a yuri VN that seemed to only be about fluff and food, but I adored what I got.  One of my main personal negatives would be the age of the main characters. With characters as young as nine years old I found it hard to relate to the romance. However, with them both being far too mature for their age it never felt like they were as child-like as you would expect children who actually were nine, so that could really help those of us who have a hard time relating to romance between kids. (And the epilogue is fantastic, which totally helps. Did I mention the epilogue being good?)  (For anyone ever planning on making their own game like this:) The user interface can't seem to decide on whether to call the settings for 'Preferences' or 'Options'. This is a minor problem with a minor fix; having consistent naming for screens and tools in UIs generally makes using it flow more smoothly for users."
407380,Strania - The Stella Machina -,+Good challenge +love the premise +short but sweet +nice alternate game modes  +techno music fits the game well +weapons are fun and interesting to utilize in a variety of situations +few replays will ever be the same  I recommend it.

407680,Last Days of Spring Visual Novel,"Not realy sure how I ended up with this game, but I played it despite not being the target audience. It's about a girl's last week in High School and possibly ending up with someone romantically at the party after graduation. It's a passable story, but the art work is pretty mediocre and you're in the position of being introduced to all these new characters who you've supposedly gone to school with for years, so it all feels a bit rushed. You can confess your feelings to someone or not at the end of the game, but there's really not enough time or substance to the game to feel very emotionally invested in any of it. The actual game time is about an hour, the rest was trading card idling."
407690,R.B.I. Baseball 16,"Growing up, I loved Ken Griffey Jr's Winning Run on SNES. I bought this expecting something similar. Not The Show or the 2K series, not OOTP, but an arcadey version of baseball to scratch the itch without putting in too much effort. I didn't want perfection, the occasional bug would've been fine.  For the most part I got what I was expecting, but I quickly found a game ruining bug where both myself and the AI could hit NOTHING but foul balls. Hitting a ball in play was no longer possible. We would both smack foul ball after foul ball until a walk or a missed swing for a strikeout (which was rare). Every at-bat turned into a 20+ pitch at-bat. It didn't matter that my pitcher was exhausted (200+ pitches), the AI was just going to hit fouls no matter what. I restarted the game, it went okay for several innings until the bug reappeared. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the refund policy was for less than 2 hours played. I own over 70 games on Steam, never regretted a purchase, never asked for a refund. This game broke that streak for me.  I am very disappointed that the MLB would endorse and advertise for this game. I don't think any of them actually played it for more than an hour. No arcade baseball game for PC is better than having this game."
407700,Lonath Online, Early Access Review
407720,Poker Pretty Girls Battle: Texas Hold'em,"horrible... disrespect to poker, the ai is trash and all its got is a little fanservice. wouldn't even recommend to newbs."
407780,Lethe - Episode One,"First things first, didn't play a lot of this. My experience: Boring. Predictable. Just your typical horror game, youtubers will sream their arses over, and make all the kids watching them, buy it. Just not scary at all. No backstory given after an hour of gameplay. No clue what's happening, why I am where I am, what exactly is my purpose in this place. I see a lot of comparisements to amnesia, and i do agree. Lethe, would be great - back in 2010. And even back then, it would be nowhere near topping Amnesia. Lack of atmosphere is killing this game. I know, I should've played this for longer than an hour. True. Maybe the game picks up a lot in the latter stages. MAYBE. And maybe not. I won't know. But I'll have my 12 quid back, so that's good:).  Summary? BORING! PREDICTABLE! NO ATMOSPHERE! NOT SCARY! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
407810,Hard Reset Redux,"A cyberpunk tale of humans vs. machines in an all-out robot holocaust FPS action fest. Don't expect too much going in, as this game plays out along the lines of a classic FPS. If you have some decent hardware the graphics are pretty slick with a consistent framerate.  Word from the wise though, the weapons kinda suck initially, especially when playing on a higher difficulty setting, that is until you level them up/unlock additional components and parts, etc. You actually only acquire 3 weapons, two of which you have from the start: a machine gun of sorts, a plasma-ish gun and a cyber katana (something you get part way through the game). The catch is that both the MG and PG allow for additional weapon attachment unlocks, such as a shotgun, grenade launcher and RPG for the MG and a rail gun, mines and smart gun for the PG, to name a few.  There are a few boss battles which can get pretty intense and some pretty tough lesser enemies throughout the game. Like I said earlier, don't expect too much story-wise: this is all about shooting stuff, mostly robots, so if you're into that sort of thing and enjoy Flying Hog's better known FPS series (Shadow Warrior), you should give this a go."
407830,Space Overlords,"I got a key for this game from the devs so thanks devs! This does NOT affect my verdict of the game. I have not finished the story mode of the game so I'm only talking on game play right now. I made a game play video of this game on my YT channel Krisfire Here! -&gt;  https://youtu.be/CrUXlbmY1cQ   (The small amount of story that is in the game opening) The Overlords created everything, and one of the Overlords sealed the others away to rule over the universe solo. That's all I got so far lol.  The game play is what I would call a beat-em-up destruction game; you control one of 4 Overlords, each with different powers, strengths, and weaknesses. You use them to destroy planets and colonizations made by the rogue overlords creations. There are different types of planets and different environments that each planet might have from an ice planet with lava ocean to a desert planet with an ice ocean. Each planet has different defensive systems. You get 4 different power ups that charge as you destroy things that you may also use to destroy more things.  The fighting is really fun, but gets repetitive really quick. I'm hoping as the game moves to the later levels it spices up.   The world creating is really cool as it lets the community build and create all sorts of different levels that can either be really easy...or really REALLY HARD!   Overall the game is a fun game that gets slightly boring after awhile, but is a fun game to kill time.   7/10 Good time killer."
407880,Mad Nords: Probably an Epic Quest,   Early Access Review
407900,Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt,"graphically, it reminded me of a commodore 64 game, with how everything had 1 or 2 colors, and I thought that worked in the game's favor. what I didn't like, though, is that the action sequences just, happen. you can't stop shooting, either, and when you're behind cover, good luck staying there for long. also, my character kept turning when I didn't want her to, meaning that I had to press a button every time I wanted her to take a step, which still didn't help a whole lot. overall, I think it needs more polish, and I'm glad it was free."
407940,Hyper Bounce Blast,"Worst platformer/shooter I've played in ages.  This game gets it all wrong. Gamepad controls can't be configured and the configuration is badly chosen. Rules are poorly explained, complex and not any fun.   And finally, after only a few minutes of gameplay, when I tried to restart from the first level in classic mode the game locked up on me."
407980,Sakura Beach 2,Played this on my laptop on Steam using free Wi-Fi.  10/10 would get kicked out of Burger King before I finished with my Whopper again.
40800,Super Meat Boy,Super Meat Boy crashed 6 times. ;_; Still good though. 
408000,Cinderella Escape! R12,It just was not as good as I was hoping. Kind of disappointing..
408110,Planet R-12,"Tedious and terrible game. Have the designers even played it themselves? The first few levels are sort of ok --- nothing thrilling but no big issue. With 1hr into the game the levels suddenly get none-sense. The one you see on the screen shots that is fighting the bugs in a swamp is basically walking-backwards-and-left-clicking for a dozen minutes because the bugs are freakingly tough and slow. The other one that you drive a tank to fight an eyeball spider is a dumb copy of angry-birds --- except that you don't see your trajectory before shooting, both you and the spider is moving and that there is no way you can dodge the spider's attack. Oh, and there are three of them, coming out one by one, followed by a boss whose attack you cannot dodge, neither."
408120,Cibele,"There isn't much of a 'game' here, but I am recommending it because it gives you an intimate look into someone's first internet love. There aren't any other games out there that tackle this subject so personally. It's not a very long game, but it's worth a shot if you're interested in the subject matter. I'm glad I played this game."
408170,Networm,Quite an Addtictive Game But could add more to it but twith games like this once they are finished you cant really do anything else with them Great game though Well developed and very fun to play while passing time good price if you want to pass time BUY THIS GAME :)
408250,Eagle Flight,"it's a nice idea, but for me the world could have been more vibrant... alive....The flying, well doesn't feel like flying like i experience in Aerofly 2 for exampel (a flight simulator). Multiplayer could make this a bit more fun, but unfortunatly there are no other players to play with :( if it was 10 bucks i would keep it in my library, but for 40 euros... no."
408280,Message Quest,"A cute little fantasy game with simple instructions and adorable graphics, it also has a fun story! Though when finishing with this game it leaves you wanting more. This is a very short game."
408340,Gravity Lab, Early Access Review
408400,Swords and Sorcery - Underworld - DEFINITIVE EDITION,"Old school feel, perfect game for what it claims to be! I enjoyed it more than Might and Magic X. Sure in the graphic aera it is 25 years old, but all the RPG feel of the party evolution, the exploration and the ingenuity from the developer to make you feel like in an adventure with the somehow basic game he built were refreshing.  Well worth the 30 hours to finish and the 15 euros it worth.   "
408440,Dream Factory, Early Access Review
408640,CODE OF PRINCESS,"This isn't the best game I've played on Steam, but I'm giving it a thumbs up because it delivers on what it promises. The 2D beat-em-up gameplay is quick to pick up, and chaining together combos on-the-fly to slice and dice the monsters to bits is quite satisfying. You can switch between the main characters, but you'll have to level them all from lv.1, which can be annoying but also extends the gameplay time and gives you that sense of RPG grindy goodness of watching your character go from weakling to instrument of mass destruction. I wish there were more moves for each character or that you could unlock a couple of upgrades, but you can still come up with enough variations of the basic moveset to stay entertained for a while. The animations are okay, but the characters do look a bit pixelated from the transition from DS game to PC full-screen. My biggest complaint is the story. It's your standard generic comedy JRPG fare that really only exists to string together a series of self-referrential jokes. The princess begins her journey by traveling through the countryside trying to evade the incompetent bad guys who want to capture her and her giant magic sword. She tries to hide from the bad guys by using the subtle tactic of walking around in broad daylight wearing her royal outfit complete with crown while hoisting her massive sword around wherever she goes. The battle stages themselves sadly only last about 1-2 minutes each, and then you get another cutscene (which you can thankfully speed along by holding C)."
408650,ChromaGun,"  Chroma Gun is the FPS for people who can't play FPS. The few moments of 'oh my God, faster, FASTER' are just enough to feel accomplished when successful, but not so frequent that you feel overwhelmed by the technical aspects. The story is basically non-existant, and that's o.k. The puzzles will keep your head scratching and then when you've solved them all, going back and speed running the entire game keep you engaged for even longer. There are some frustrating moments, certainly, but it's all from the trial and error nature of the game. Once you learn: it's great!  Full disclosure: I received a review copy of this game from Pixel Maniacs. The review itself is mine and they had no influence on its outcome."
408740,Pro Gamer Manager,"This game has a good core idea, but it is carried out horribly.   The major flaw is: stats and level means nothing to this game   When it comes to the tournament and competetions, your level of skill means nothing, your team members stats means nothing, and how many hours your team played together or how well they cooperate also means nothing.   Even though your team are all aces with 99 on all stats, and your oppenents are trolls with 30-40 stats.. your chances of winning is still 50-50, just like a coin toss.   And all the effort of building the team seems to be all for nothing.    DO NOT BUT THIS"
408750,Starsphere,"  funny, play to kill time 7/10"

408930,ePic Character Generator,"This program will not let me paste my 100-character randomly generated password from my password manager (LastPass) into the login, so I cannot use the program without typing it out (not happening!). (That is, Ctrl+V and dragging the highlighred password doesn't work) I went to the website to contact support, but no support information is provided.

408990,Timber and Stone, Early Access Review
409000,Mystery Chronicle: One Way Heroics,"One way heroics... but more! what more could you want? though, there are some weird framerate issues, it's locked at 30 fps and doesn't feel as smooth as the previous games, so if that's gonna bug you, hold on til they fix it (hopefully they do)   edit: honestly, the stutter and low performance feel of the game is really unsettling... game doesn't move as fast as original at all, and feels like a step down in that department, and since you're going to be feeling that for the entirety of the game... until it's fixed (unless it's never fixed) changing to not recommend."
409020,The Stanford Ocean Acidification Experience,What a crock of sh$t.   Please donate and tell your government to fund our bs program so we can make more bs programs.  This program explains the simple process of co2 transfer from air to water. They forget to mention that this process is governed by water temperature. All made up cr@p to support their fat over paid bodies. 
409040,Herolike,"Pretty fun ARPG with some base building/roguelike features. There are four classes in game and each has four special attack/defense skills to invest in besides the standard stats. You choose random encounters across a 'world map' and up grade your town with materials earned from each encounter. Most of the game feels stable, only had 2 crashes in all my time played. However, on occasion some maps will load with no encounters spawning on them, forcing you to exit back to the load screen.   Would like to have seen a few more map types as the journey across the world map gets a bit stale as you progress. Boss fights were ok , liked that each had some diversity. Overall enjoyable game that can be played at your own pace."
409070,Fist Slash: Of Ultimate Fury,"TLDR: Great if you can map your controller  This is like two different games. If you have a way to map the analog stick controls to your dpad it's a great Ninja Gaiden tribute with tight controls, great music, a weenie mode for people like me and two more difficulties for people with actual skill. If you don't have that it's a rage inducing game with horrible controls where at least half of your deaths will be from stick movement not registering correctly. Too bad the controls aren't mappable in the game options themselves.   I've been playing the game for a couple months. The controller issue was annoying but I was able to get past levels 1-3 despite it. Then I hit level 4 and suddenly it became ragequit city. I'd play once or twice a week, use up my lives on 4-2 or 4-4's spikes thanks to movements not registering (note that I wasn't even playing on normal or hard where the spikes one-shot you) and ragequit for a few more days. Today I set up a custom keybind profile for my controller and I immediately blasted through all of level 4 on one life. Great game if you rebind and I'd recommend it unreservedly if it had that in the options."
409090,The Big Secret of a Small Town,Very very good game but... very very difficult one! If you succeed in finishing the game without using any hints congrats to you! Don't start with this one if you are new to hidden objects games! The game background is really nice. 9/10 
409100,The Purring Quest,"This cute cat game is everything I have wanted from a feline platforming game. No spaceships. No rainbows or pop tarts. Only cute, realistically animated cats on an adventure, travelling through towns and forests, climbing on roofs and branches.  To support its more realistic approach to the subject, The Purring Quest has lively hand drawn graphics that look very fluid in motion and a music track that adds to the relaxing atmosphere. Levels have plenty of collectables and the learning curve is fair. Controls get a bit wonky at times, but luckily game doesn't demand insanely precise platforming and there is just enough checkpoints to keep you from becoming too frustrated over a difficult jump.    OVERALL: Simple and short, cat fans will love it  The Purring Quest doesn't do anything terribly wrong, but it doesn't give you that 'whoa' feeling either. It's a cute and enjoyable game with a touching story. If you start the game with that in mind, you will get 1 - 2 hours of fun feline platforming, maybe 3 hours if you like to hunt for hidden items."
409160,"Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist","It is short and sweet. This game has some of the charm that The Stanley Parable had. It is not as good, but it has its own charm and personality. For a free game this is an 8/10."
409170,Contract,The dev abandoned the game.

40930,The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom,Pretty good
409320,Syndrome,"It's sorta hard to recommend this, I do so because although the story is very similar to one of my favorites, it still has some nice design and was still entertaining to play through. There are several bugs that became very annoying, I fell through the map at least 3 times, I got so annoyed I mem cracked my ammo so I could just brute force my way through the game. I would NOT NOT NOT... and I repeat...NOT buy this game at price... DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS ON HARDCORE SALE 50% or more off. I bought it at 30% off and I feel that still was high at $17.50 usd. I think 7-10 would be fair."
409340,Perraw - FPS Clone War, Early Access Review
409360,Faron's Fate,"Well, this is just shameless. This is a checklist of item types, item names, room layouts, enemy names, enemy visuals, enemy behaviors and bosses directly stolen from The Binding of Isaac. The final boss of this game is even an exact replica, down to every attack and behavior, of Mega Satan. It even looks like a red demon. Except this is all done with clunky controls and combat, and the game only offers 6 floors and is incredibly easy. On my first go with the game, without even truly learning how to handle the awkward combat controls, I both beat the game and got the speedrun achievement. That's not supposed to happen with any roguelite or roguelike.  It's not a terrible effort and what little originality there was looked pretty good. I liked the addition of more classic RPG loot, like how you have armor you can upgrade and such. However, this is sort of like when you start practicing the guitar and all you do is learn other people's riffs, since that's the most fun way to get started. You don't actually sit down and record those riffs and sell them to people, much like you shouldn't just shamelessly rip off The Binding of Isaac and sell that. Build a prototype off of Isaac and then keep working on it and adding new ideas until you have your own product if you want to sell it. Just painting by numbers and following a template isn't good enough."
409380,Among the Heavens,"This is one of those spastic restaurant type sims where you have to take orders, fill orders, keep customers happy, and juggle all that ♥♥♥♥ while still trying to remember to have fun. It's made by the same people behind the 12 Labors of Hercules series so it's actually a really well-made game, but having actually worked in busy stores and ♥♥♥♥ with pissy moany baby ♥♥♥ adult customers crying because their latte doesn't have foam or their box of cornflakes is dented, this is NOT NECESSARILY MY FAVORITE GENRE BECAUSE I PLAY GAMES TO RELAX AND NOT STRESS THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT.  And i'm slightly exaggerating, but they legitimately do tap into that same sort of automaton catatonia that you experience in a customer service environment during a rush and I never enjoyed that feeling while I was working so why the ♥♥♥♥ would I want to play a game that invokes that same feeling, I guess. Some games make it worth your while, like the fantastic Cook, Serve, Delicious, which ... well it's still stressful, but it's better. I don't think this is bad, but I don't know how much I wanna stick with it because I'm terrible at these ♥♥♥♥in things."
409390,Marble Mountain,"When you first boot up Marble Mountain, you probably won't be impressed. The graphics look very cheap, the music sounds like some sort of cheap royalty-free track, and the noises made by the 'skull' enemies that soon appear are just awful. It doesn't help that later in the game, the larger levels are very poorly marked and you will spend a decent amount of time trying to figure out which direction you're meant to go, and there's one particular desert-themed level that is just complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  But you know what? I really like this game, for three main reasons:  1. Maybe it's just me, but I can't find a good old-fashined marble run game on Steam. Maybe they went out of fashion, but I really like the balancing act of manuevering many imaginative obstacles and occasional light puzzles and maintaining control over my marble.  2. The controls are sublime. It's really easy to control your marble without losing too much control, yet when you have to maneuver across a sloped surface, you can almost FEEL the marble trying to roll away. it's smooth, it's responsive, and I love it.  3. Despite the poor layout, I'm genuinely impressed by the design of the levels. The developer has clearly put some thought into building the world that you navigate, and there is a great amount of variety to the obstacles and puzzles. The levels are never just plain single-coloured blocks with the occasional decoration but fully fleshed out scenes and structures, and it genuinely feels like your little marble is going on an adventure.  In addition to the above, at the time of writing, I'm up to a level simply titled 'Tricksy', and that is when ♥♥♥♥ gets real and the developer kicks his design ideas up a notch.  VR support is also a bonus. Admittedly, I can't review this as I don't have VR equipment at home, but I imagine it's quite cool. Having support for both Steam and third-party VR is a great idea from the developer, too.  TL;DR: Buy it when it's on sale.  Pros: - clever level design - great controls - good old-fashioned fun - VR support  Cons: - looks cheaply made - poor level layout - that one ♥♥♥♥ing desert level - annoying music &amp; SFX"

409450,The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians,"I got suckered into believing the reviews, they are either friends of the creators or they got paid....this is an amateurish *pos*. The character creation would have been a joke even in the 80s, not kidding it seriously is pathetic....I cannot begin to tell you how serious I am...do not waste one dollar on this garbage...there are way too many games you can buy for the same price that are actually competent. I got scammed out of 12 dollars."
409460,Blackfaun,"Admittedly I thought BlackFaun was strange at first, but once you play it for a while, you'll start to get hooked on it. I hope there will be a new playable character class though, because two doesn't feel like much. Good game."
40950,Stronghold HD,"I have a long history with this ancient game.I first start playing it when i was 9.together with stronghold2 and stronghold crusader,I enjoyed thousands of hours of classic and well made strategy gameplay. This game feels so natural,but is not a realistic game. It can be fun,but even with the hd version,you will feel the ,,medieval,, graphics.Fortunately,the music and sound are amazing. Overall, a good game,even today."
409510,Genesis Online,"attempent #1: the game wouldn't load, so i pulled out my 3ds and ran an expiriment. surely enough, i was able to beat a leven in shovel knight without the game loading.  attempt #2: i tried using guides to help me load the game. none of them were helpful.  the only exitement you'll get out of this game is deleting it. 0/10 couldn't even play."
409520,Ginger: Beyond the Crystal,"If you like classic platform games, then this is abolutely your chance.  It combines some of the classic gameplays with current mechanics to make a great and funny product  Colourful, friendly and high quality music,  It deserves a try without hesitation!"

40960,Stronghold 2,"I just bought this and the basic gameplay is ok for single player, but I just found out that they will be closing the ability to play multiplayer soon so don't buy this if you wat to play multiplayer.   Also there is still no way to allow multiplayer play with AI players"

409630,Rumble,"Meh. The idea isn't bad but the execution is kinda bare-bones. That, and the graphical optimization is godawful. My laptop can run pretty modern games, but it chugged trying to play this. Has the potential to be a good game if they fix the graphics and add more variety to the combat"
409660,Angry Video Game Nerd II: ASSimilation,"A follow-up to 2013's 'Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures', 'ASSimilation' introduces a number of new mechanics to the platforming formula of its predecessor while also adding a host of new references to the YouTube series that inspired it.  One of the biggest changes this time around is that the levels are each split in to four smaller stages accessible via a world map. This actually makes the game quite a bit easier, especially since the main bosses of each area can be attempted directly from the map instead of having to make it through a large level beforehand.   Another change is that the other selectable characters ( Mike, Guitar Guy etc. ) have been ditched in favor of collecting armor pieces which each offer the Nerd new upgrades and abilities.   Overall though I felt that the game was a little on the short side and even stopping to collect all the N-E-R-D cartridge pickups didn't seem to add a lot of additional mileage. I also felt that the jokes and references weren't quite as good this time around and some of the traps and pitfalls in the game were more frustrating than challenging.  If you are a fan of the Angry Video Nerd series then you are still likely to enjoy this game, however if you are unfamiliar with the Nerd and are simply looking for a good retro-themed platformer then the first Angry Video Game Adventures would probably be a better place to start."

40970,Stronghold Crusader HD,"Stronghold Crusader is a must for strategy gamers and city builders out there.  I recommend buying this before you buy all the other titles that came after this particular Stronghold game. This one is the best, in my opinion, in the series.  The only problem is the multiplayer. For some reason it has always been very bad. It is lags from time to time, or just stops completely. Playing in singleplayer mode is worth it though, you get so much satisfaction when you finished the campaigns!  They have tried to resurrect the feeling the players got and get when playing this game with Stronghold Crusader 2, but they failed horribly. (Again, in my opinion.) This one stays the best."
409710,BioShock Remastered,"The game itself is obviously just as amazing as its predecessor. However, the only differences between the original and remastered are slight graphics and lighting improvements. The remastered, however, has many issues with crashes, lost saves, lost director commentaries, and reset difficulty levels. I would stick to the original base game for Bioshock."
409720,BioShock 2 Remastered,"I just finished Bioshock remastered and had not one issue. I am now playing Bioshock 2 remastered and again no problems so far. I know there were some issues at launch, but they must have been fixed by now. This game is so addicting. I can not wait to play Minerva's Den, thats like an entire extra game. Rememeber to update all your hardware and the game should be fine."
409730,Death by Game Show,"  I;m not sure if the graphics are good and bad. gets repetitive fast and it's not fun. If you think this game looks good and fun, it's not.."

409910,The Storm Guard: Darkness is Coming, Early Access Review
409920,Brilliant Shadows - Part One of the Book of Gray Magic,"Fun, intresting rpg. The art was beautiful and the writing was ok though it definitely got much better as the game progressed. I wish there was more interaction besides a few simple choices but the storyline was interesting enough to keep me engaged. Most important to note is the lesbian protagonist and pretty diverse set of main characters.  I'm excited for the 2nd installation and hope there's more dependent on player choices.   "
4100,Poker Superstars II,♥♥♥♥♥♥ game of all time -_- not even worth playing if all your doing is playing agenst NPCs
41000,Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter,"It's kinda like DOOM, except somehow even more bloody and rediculous."
410000,Chalo Chalo, Early Access Review
410040,Hope in Hell,why
410050,The Forgotten Forest,"It's an okay RPG, there is a long scene in the beginning that doesn't let you do anything other than read and watch, which I know there is many RPGs that do that, but this one is a bit bland in the story content of the beginning. You also have no direct point of what you need or what to grab, it's mainly just hope you find something and get it right or risk starting all over if you have no multisaves. Rebecca, the main character, is a little bland and too cheerful and doesn't seem to really have much depth into her, just random 'things' that come to her as she explores the forgotten forest after being forced to run into it. There isn't much more I can say on this, but... yeah it's up to the person to buy it or not, but I say there are better RPGs out there, but if you're one to just play all of them then go ahead."
410110,12 is Better Than 6,"It's a fun game, beat it in a few hours"
410120,AGON - The Mysterious Codex (Trilogy),"I hated this. Mainly because I hate games with puzzles too hard that I have to play the game constantly referring to walkthrough. I gave up in disgust in Lapland after heavily relying on one in London and found the puzzles just as obscure and irritating.   Other than that, the game had a nice and I especially liked the music in Lapland, but the controls annoyed me. You use arrows to move forward and then you have to click and hold to turn in different directions. It was easy to miss inventory items.   Not my cup of tea at all. I have a headache from playing it and no interest in finishing it.    "
410130,AGON - The Lost Sword of Toledo,A pretty fun point-and-click adventure that get misjudeged. I would suggest it to any kind of POC fan. :)
410150,Swapperoo,"Fun match-3 with tricky, rewarding puzzles. The polish on this game is impeccable, from the visual style to that lovely jazz music. There's a light plot - so light it's almost nonexistant - but when it pops up it's nicely handled and adds an air of mystery to the game.  If you like match-3, get it! Absolutely worth it!"
410290,Acorn Assault: Rodent Revolution,Good concept but gets very unfair very quickly.
410320,EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 4.1  The Shadow of New Despair,"To save our mother earth from any alien attack, From vicious giant insects who have once again come back, We'll unleash all our forces, we won't cut them any slack!  The EDF Deploys!  Our soldiers are prepared for any alien threats The navy launches ships, the air force sends their jets! And nothing can withstand our fixed bayonets  The EDF Deploys!  Our forces have now dwindled and we pull back to regroup, The enemy has multiplied and formed a massive group, We'd better beat these bugs before we're all turned to soup  The EDF Deploys!  --  Really, this is the only way to describe this game, as it is the best way to describe the game. Man up, join the EDF."
410340,Liftoff, Early Access Review
410370,Huenison,"Huension is a retro puzzle shooter with Atari aesthetics, it's fun to play, smooth and very fun on occasions to come back to, starts as easy but it turns hellishly difficult, a great game for the price it asks for."
410430,Morphine,"I am actually pleased to see this software is developed by only one man, but well, I really cannot consider it as a game. It is more like a story telling 'thing', maybe telling some feeling about the author being bullied in school by the time he was young. Sort of like the experience about playing the game 'The Paths'. If you like such kind of game, this software might worth to buy during a price cut. It is hard for me to select the yes no buttons in the recommend section. Really only do recommend if it has a huge price cut, otherwise, better buy something else.  Pros: Good imagination... The art works are not bad. Too short so that I can finish it quick.  Cons: Too dark in some of the rooms. Too much 'I am not a loser'. The story is not fluent at all. This is not really a game. Too short. Too slow. Really cannot control the charactor most of the time. Like I want to try shooting everyone, but I cannot even aim, or like I want to shoot the bottles, but the bottles were shot in a weird way. Make me think of the author was taking drugs while creating this software..."
410440,Vertigo Void,"No thanks... Not even if you gave me the game although maybe, just maybe, if it didnt have STEAM Trading Cards I might have found something to like."
410470,Expander,"A simple game about grabbing stars while avoiding the walls, the only goal is to go for the highest score. Despite being barebones it provides a good challenge, and makes for a nice time killer if you're waiting 10 minutes for a download or similar."
410490,Elements: Epic Heroes,+ Simple and intuitive game. + Intresting graphics.  + Good game for this priсe! + Recommend to all!
41050,Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter,These are some SERIOUSLY bad graphics.
410540,Starlord,Buggy clunky &amp; basially crap
410550,Tank: The M1A1 Abrams Battle Tank Simulation,"This game is so terrible, but it's so old that it doesn't really matter. It's just sit there and be confused simulator. I knew it wouldn't gonna be good but it was made in 1989, how could I not buy it?"
410570,Gunjack,"It's fun. It works with the Vive touch controllers in spite of the warning when launching the game, they just might be mapped backwards. I also haven't had any luck getting it to see my 360 controller. It's still a fun game and worth the money. I'd give it an unqualified recommendation if they push a patch. It's still worth the money in the meantime."
41060,Serious Sam Classic: The Second Encounter,Anu: Look at that sweet armour. Olo: Let's pick it up. -gazzillion monsters spawn- Anu: Fu*k. :) #dumbass idiots falling for every trap  69/10 would save the world with friends again.  
410670,Suits: A Business RPG,"*Buys the game, starts it up, sees a figure, uses WASD, doesn't work.. Uses arrow keys, doesn't work. pressed X, inventory works.*  best game, start off in a room where you can't move. 10/10    no but seriously, i know its just 47p but this game gotta be playable."
41070,Serious Sam 3: BFE,not even close to SS1 and SS2
410770,Roads of Rome,"Very similar gameplay to the 12 Labours of Hercules series but not quite as polished. Gets slightly trickier towards the end and may need a couple of attempts on one or two of the later levels to get the expert score.  Fairly short and fun enough for the price, but needs an option to adjust screen resolution, and you really miss the ability to queue actions in advance."
410820,Starward Rogue,"Positive - But only just...  Its not a bad game, its just really easy, very similar to a certain nuclear themed game. I walked through it on normal mode even with a non-combat specialised mech. Some of the power-ups are just way too OP, I had a seeking-scatter-bouncing-flaming missile launcher. Things off screen just died and I had no reason to let go of the trigger, visuals are nice, the Boss fights are cool, just needs to be harder"
410840,Rock God Tycoon,   Early Access Review
410850,DRAGON QUEST HEROES™ Slime Edition,Alright I will admit this game can get really repetitive but honestly mostly all dynasty warrior are very repetitive absorb why just do barely see a Dynasty warrior game also just make the good grade of a 6/10 or a 7/10...honestly though I love this more than a series repeat of the same history of a han dynasty that you completly already know of 'Jin Dyntasy' won(former Wei). Spin off are great lol...but repeat history is much worse...anyway back to the game. The story to Dragon Quest heroes to me was great not as great as the dragon quest series but great people really give this a bad review because Dragon Quest fans consider this way too repetitive to be honestly every final boss in Dragon Quest is repetitive....meh remeber DQ5 hitting 999 on the boss and will still be going for good 5mins on him lmao. Ah the memories...honestly I approve this game if can consider deal with the repetitive you wan't feel to dissappointed in the game plus if really into hack'n'slash games.
410890,Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.2 Watanagashi,"So this is the second chapter Watanagashi, which is to sum it up the story of Mion &amp; another girl you'll get to know (I'm uncertain wether she already appeared in ch.1) I guess. You'll learn more about her past and secrets, even though you still experience the whole story as keichi as in ch. 1.  To be honest, I don't know what to say. It's higurashi. It's perfect. you'll fall from fulfilled happiness to excessive dread. If u loved ch.1 just buy ch.2. It's so worth it."
410910,Deathless: The City's Thirst,"I really enjoyed this game. I've been a big fan of the Craft Sequence series of novels by Max Gladstone. This game tied in very well to Last First Snow and Two Serpents Rise. Having read those novels enriches this game, and this game also enriches those novels. That's a great way to use the genre. In fact, I think it ties in much better to the novels than the first game did. But the first game had a better stand alone plot.  The decisions in this game really make you weigh your choices. There are often no 'right' choices. Do you save the farmers land and let the citizen of the near by city die of thirst? Or do you save the water and let the farmers fend for themselves?  I hope Max makes more games, and I hope he keeps tying them more closely to the books.  If you enjoy the books, I highly recommend this game. If you enjoyed the first game, but haven't read the books, it may not be the sequel you were hoping for. But if you enjoyed the first game, READ THE BOOKS! They are amazing."
410970,Master of Orion 1,"This game will always have a special place in my collection. I have owned this game in one format or another for about 2 decades. I still come back to this game from time to time for nastalgia. It may not look like much, but many core mechanincs used in modern turn based strategy games can be traced back here. I maintaned an old DOS machine after the release of Windows XP just for this game I enjoyed it so much. Simple by todays standards, but still fun."
410980,Master of Orion 2,The creator of 4x games.
410990,Master of Orion 3,"Not as grand as its predecessors, but its credit is that it didn't destroy their legacy.  -Universal Gamer"
41100,Hammerfight,"This game is an interesting concept of physics based fighting. You control a big flying machin with a giant weapon attatched. Then you swing that weapon into other flying machines. It took maybe 3 hours to beat the campaign and with the arena mode there's plenty of gameplay left. The story isn't amazing, but the combat is flat out addictive. The game has tons of weapons that range from boulder on a chain to giant sword to giant hammer. There are even big bombs and spears you can hurl at opponents.   The downside is that this game begs for multiplayer which will most likely never exist. The closest thing you can get is if you and a buddy play on the same PC with 2 mice."
411000,Sorcery! Parts 1 & 2,"I can't remember if I got this game on sale or from a humble bundle, but I have to say it was completely worth every penny I paid. In fact its easily worth more than $10.  It's a very fun game, but it is somewhat short. It's also kind of a niche product, you have to be a fan of the RPG genre to be able to fully appreciate this title.   As far as gameplay, it's a choose your own adventure type game, it's very D&amp;D like; it's also easy to pick up and play.  Overall: 8 1/2 out of 10."
411060,Roads of Rome 2,"Quite a fun casual game. Took me 10 hours to complete on expert. It can be a bit frustrating, but it's the fun kind of frustrating."
411080,SHOWTIME 2073,"For a buck, you really can't go wrong with this game. Think of it as a FPS Pacman, where you go around collecting spheres to progress while fighting against enemies. Its pretty fun, and with an active developer, who knows what this game may turn into.  EDIT: Price changed to $1.99, but the game is still worth it.  EDIT of EDIT: Updates are coming slow, but the developer is eager to inform the community that he is making progress in addressing all demands (which deserves some credit).  EDIT^2: No updates as of now. F*ck this game."
411120,Galaxy Admirals, Early Access Review
411130,Leviathan: The Cargo, Early Access Review
411310,"Codename: Panzers, Phase One","One of my earliest and most favorite WWII Strategy Games, that I started playing when it was originally released. Every once in a while i used to install it. Now that it's available via steam i can rip the CD (thumbs down for not letting me register the retail version on steam ...)  tip: if you have difficulty finishing an mission try Infantry Spam. It is absurd good since Sniper and Bazookas do ridicuoulos damage to infantry or tanks. Just equip them with binoculars, put some medics in betweeen them, some close combat troops and you're good!"
411320,"Codename: Panzers, Phase Two","This game is basicly a DLC of phase one. Virtually everything is the same (game mechanics, graphics, ...), just new missions. It is quite a bit shorter than Phase one as well with +-20 missions (compared to about 30 in P1). As it is virtually the same as Phase one, you'll enjoy this one if you enjoyed the first one as well, like I did and do.  If you haven't played Phase one, just buy that one instead."
411330,Men of Valor,"Awesome game, I first played this when I was in the Marines with 1/3 (on xbox), the unit in this game is 3/3. So, that added an extra fun aspect for me personally."
411370,MELTY BLOOD Actress Again Current Code,"So you're telling me the community version of meltyblood can trample all over the steam version of meltyblood? What is this garbage? The Netcode (at the moment) is ♥♥♥, the game runs terribly, and to top it all off the options for controller config are restricted to in game. How come they couldn't just keep the config menus from the old versions of MBACC so every controller could be supported? How come the online matches are behind 2-3 seconds of lag? The only bright side to this port is that I can finally read the story mode, but other than that this version of Melty is craptrash.   tl;dr: I was really looking forward to this port because I thought I'd be getting the same functionality as the pirated versions with an english patch and some achievements. I ended up with a crappier game."
411390,Getsuei Gakuen -kou-,A darker game than I'd usually play but I was with it up until the godawful twist 'true' ending
411550,Island Tribe,"Rather dull time management game with poor level design. Everything's hidden by a fog of war and has to be gradually revealed, and the amount of resources needed for building and upgrading is arbitrary and unpredictable, so it's impossible to strategize beforehand. But it's also impossible to fail. There's no time limit, just high scores and gold times, but the map doesn't show at a glance which levels you've beaten the gold times for and which you've utterly failed, so you wouldn't know which ones to replay even if you wanted to. If you're looking for a better game with a similar theme, try  MOAI  instead."
411560,Reveal The Deep,"I loved the atmosphere and I found the story pretty interesting. It's a short game of puzzles and creepy sounds. Not really any horror or jumpscares, and pretty good overall in my opinion."
411570,Zombie Exodus,"This game is really badly written. The overly used 'you' and many grammar errors, the badly made skills set. I mean, i'm a soldier who trained a lot firing with different weapons, but i find myself uncapable of hitting 1 hit kill at any given moment. This is ridiculous. Also, the close quarters combat is almost impossible, since even if it is one-on-one, there are parts the the zombie will overcame your powers, embrancing you while eating your flesh. And i've tried multiple times at the same part, with a combat knife, with a chivalry sword, even an spiked bat. It could be good, but it isn't. I gotta admit though, although i did not like the 'book' at it's plenitude, the path between the beginning and the end was slightly pleasant."
411590,The Rivers of Alice - Extended Version,"I was hoping I'd enjoy this game, but I found it too confusing. See, the game doesn't use words to communicate what the player needs to do, it uses pictures. Badly drawn, small pictures that I just couldn't figure out. I don't mind a game that doesn't hand-hold (grew up in the 80s after all lol) but SOME indication of what the pictures actually mean would've been great."

411630,Wicked Witches,"Wicked Witches...Wicked Good Fun! That's right...Wreak havoc on those unsuspecting Townies! Destroy EVERYTHING and ANYONE who dares to stands in your evil-doing ways! Stike with Deadly Chain Lightening, Evil Spells and a Fireball or two from hell, just for Good Measure! Ride your broom high and low!...In short, you'll have a flipping blast! You won't need a RL 'Pyewacket the cat' to help out on missions or to have fun in this game. This evil Witch comes with her very own Demonic cat, (who's just as evil as their Wicked Witch Mommy!) Two Cat's Paws up on this one, guys!...Enjoy the game!"
411680,Loot Hound," http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/loot-hound-review/  - Full Review  Loot Hound is everything that’s wrong with mobile gaming in a PC package, and without the benefit of buying your way past all the grinding. The gameplay lacks motivation or consequence, and the developers failed to implement any challenge. While there’s some strategy on what stats to spend your points on, it’s mostly a mindless slog through redundancy. The levels lack anything memorable, and the dogs have zero personality. If you can honestly get enjoyment out of digging up items like “Message In A Bottle In A Ship In A Bottle” over and over again- more power to you. For me, I’d much rather put this basic ♥♥♥♥♥ down."

411720,Quantum Lock,"Fantastic game! It's simple and clever, I just wish I could get into a game with more than just my little group of friends. I'm not sure why I can't see any games and have to host and invite friends through steam but it is really fun anyway."
411740,Yet Another World,Yet Another World nice
411750,Brick Inventions,"Boring, for a game based around building you'd think they have a decent way of building stuff without having to go through loading screens to get inventor mode. Why not just put that in levels. I was trying to build a tower for one of the levels, which had to be 25m tall and stand for 20s. Easy enough. But you can't put blocks where you want them, instead they're in some sort of horrible grid that doesn't fit them together properly."
411760,Swordbreaker The Game,The humor in this game is how bad it is. LOL The layout is rough and requires far more interaction than a visual novel should. The worst part though is the totally random deaths that happen for even basic decisions. If you want to finish this game expect to either play it over and over and over and memorize the paths or find a walk through.

412250,Empires Of Creation, Early Access Review
412270,Stories of Bethem: Full Moon,"I bought the game on sale because it looked cute. Tried to play it with default arrow keys. Didn't like it frustratingly after the intro sequence had finished, I thought it would have autosaved as I found no way to do that from the menu. It didn't so, I changed the keybindings to wasd + jkl. I didn't like this setup either. I have no idea why there is no keyboard (wasd) + mouse buttons support. I also thought that the volume was just too loud even when I put things on a lower setting. I do not have my volume usually at more than 14% in Windows sound mixer. I do not use any boost or gain or anything of the sort.  I refunded the game because of the controls and yes I played it for just about 5 minutes. Not just because of the controls but because there is no way to skip the cutscenes. Sometimes I don't really care about taking 15 minutes reading dialogues of text that isn't even that interesting or important to the game play. My apologies to the developer, but I just cannot accept this. I do not know if they used a custom developed engine or if it is GameMaker. Some might question why would refund a game that is so cheap? Same reason why I don't give money to companies that haven't earned it. Maybe if they had better keybindings and skippable cutscenes I would have actually been able to play the game."
412310,Labyrinth, Early Access Review
412370,Parallels,Big time waster and takes you're 5 dollars
412380,Legend,"Legend is a clunky mess of a beat-em-up that isn't very much fun to play. It isn't that it's an old game that doesn't hold up to today's standards. It's that it's a mediocre game that couldn't stand up to contemporary titles like Final Fight, Streets of Rage, Captain Commando, or even Golden Axe. This mediocrity hasn't exactly helped the game to age well.  Legend draws clear inspiration from the Capcom Dungeons &amp; Dragons arcade game, and delivers a modicum of that title's visual charm by deliberately copying its setting and aesthetic. Gameplay is incredibly slow, which throws off the pace of the entire game and makes the controls unweildly. This can get frustrating in a hurry, because even peon enemies can take a serious beating on even the lowest difficulty setting, and they're programmed to swarm you from both sides. The entire game is a laborious trudge through mostly palette-swapped levels, packaged and sold as a ROM run in a bare bones SNES emulator. If Legend piques your interest, seriously, just download it for free."
412400,GASP,I want my money back.
412410,Castle Chaos,"Its really bad, doesn't explain anything!  Its abit simple  The thing that i dislike about it is things happened on their own without explanation or being innately obvious. For example it went into the next phase without warning or me pressing a button for it to continue into the next phase."
412440,Jane's Realty,This is a pretty sweet facebook game. I take that last statement back because it's not very fair to facebook games as most of them are much more sorted out than this game - plus they're free. I wouldn't play this game if it was free...
412450,The Black Death, Early Access Review
412460,Villagers,i wood not buy dis because it take a year for any of your building to be done and even on the 10 time seed i was still way 1h irl just for 1 house to build and since you cant place down building unless you have what you need for it you cant rill plane head and dis game is just a ripof of banish witch is way more fun.
412470,Metal War Online: Retribution, Early Access Review
412480,Turtle Odyssey,"   7.9/10, A super fun game, but not compatible with new machines"
412490,Yrminsul,"YEAH 1: Right click to transform in ashes any creature with your powers from darkness. Muahahaha. YEAH 2: Being evil or whatever you want, you get licence to kill. Animals, goblins, all life on earth and other strange things. ♥♥♥♥ING YEAH: A must-have for tower defense addicts with new gameplay (strategy, powers and much more).   Forget the UI and rule this too-much-colorfull world. Take all the souls. Muahahaha² x2."
412540,The Minotaur,A decent at best puzzle game that gets repetitive pretty quickly. Things move too quick to strategize much and the random spawn position can sometimes get you killed.   Decent style but the game is just too basic to really be much fun for long. I dont own any gamepads so I wasn't able to check out the multiplayer mode  5 out of 10
412600,Lup,"This game is just bad. Can't recall how I go it, just hope it was free."
412660,Klang,"Is the idea of the game fantastic? Absolutely!  Can I recommend this exact game? No.  The execution needs a lot of work (mainly heavy stuttering, which is #1 on the list of things that should NEVER happen under ANY circumstance for a rhythm game). In addition, lining up more than just the immediate next action NEEDS TO BE THERE and it's not (unless you know what to look for). E.g. in Rockband you see every single note coming at you down the track. In Klang you only see a timer for the immediate next action. Is the next action only an 8th beat away so you have less than a beat to respond because you didn't see the teeny-tiny marker coming at you? TOUGH LUCK.  That being said, most of the game is good. The mechanics are solid, the graphics (when they're not stuttering) look amazing, the soundtrack is of course amazing. It's just a few execution issues that just completely kill it for me."
412670,Bullet Heaven 2,"Beautiful bullet patterns, great gameplay, great variety of characters. Doesn't last too long, but for 11.99, it's good on price to length. Also i waited for this to be on sale and I got it for 3.95, but i played the flash version for years. If you can't decide whether to buy it or not, look up bullet heaven 2 flash on chrome or whatever you use. 9/10 could be slightly longer. But all in all, if you're a fan of the bullet hell genre, (games like touhou or jamestown, as it said) then this is a must buy. If you're new to bullet hells, I would reccomend playing the flash version first. So if you're a fan of the genre, just buy it now and stop reading. Well its over now anyways so you kinda have to stop... Oh well. Also, if you're a fan of RPGs, or more specifically JRPGs, then go ahead and get epic battle fantasy 3. If you like that, buy Epic Battle Fantasy 4 and if u like that and bullet hells just buy this game ok."
412720,SMASH+GRAB, Early Access Review
412730,Days Under Custody,"This game is garbage, and the maker is a con artist who asks Steam to revoke your CD Key for NO REASON! I had to fight to get my key back, and I reccomend NO ONE buy any future games by this developer! The game also refuses to close &amp; keeps running in the background &amp; needs to be manually killed from task manager."
412740,Audioshield," At this time the Youtube support is broken with no dev response in sight, so that blows. Definitely only buy if you have your own collection of music!   My favorite Vive game by far! If you really love music this game is a must-buy.  High difficulties become so intense that it will literally work out your body. Such a rush though, you really feel your favorite songs!  Only con I can think of is at the starting difficulty the game has trouble matching up the orbs with the important parts of songs. At higher difficulties though this is not an issue and songs are generally perfect."
412770,Boogeyman,"you game is not spoopy, bad graphics, not worth $8, was ♥♥♥♥ 10/10 would make a better game then this"
412790,Adventure Time: Magic Man's Head Games,"This is a very fun, little game - it works very well in VR. It's only downside is it's pretty short, but even taking that into consideration, I heartily recommend giving this a play."
412830,STEINS;GATE,"Taking place in the Akihabara district in Tokyo, Japan during the summer of 2010,  Steins;Gate  is told from the perspective of college student and self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintaro. Rintaro is the founder and head of the Future Gadget Laboratory, an organization dedicated to creating new gadgets and technologies. Alongside him are his longtime friend from childhood Shiina Mayuri and computer expert Hashida 'Daru' Itaru. As the story begins, Rintaro is interested in the possibilities of time travel and attends a conference on the subject, but suddenly some strange events seem to suddenly change the world around him, except that no one but him remembers the world as it was. He tries to recover from the shock when he encounters the young genius Makise Kurisu, whom he had previously saw dead before the world changed.  As a person who first heard about this game before I even knew there was an anime adaptation (as I am not really an anime fan), I went into this mostly blind. I am a little biased since I have a soft spot for time travel movies and this game's premise immediately interested me. I was not disappointed.  This game is a visual novel, a type of video game that is heavily story-based and requires little input from the player. There are a few different routes to take and this game has a total of six different endings depending on the choices the player makes during play.  As a visual novel, the main attraction here is the story and writing. I found this aspect of the game to be excellent. To be sure, the story starts off rather slow. The first few hours does come off as a little boring as the premise is established and the characters are introduced. However, if you stick with it the reward is a very engaging story along with well-written and memorable characters. Time travel is the main theme of the story and it explores the ethical and philosophical implications of its use. The plot itself becomes more intricate and interesting as the story continues on and this writing keeps it interesting all the way to the end. Indeed, as I was playing through this I often found myself losing track of time (no pun intended) as I kept wondering what would happen next. Really, the less you know about the plot going in, the more you are likely to enjoy it. On top of that, I also enjoyed the amount of humor in the game as it contains many jokes such as poking fun at nerd culture. In addition, the story can be quite emotional at times as Rintaro must deal with the consequences of using time travel technology.  The art in the game is good and it includes detailed backgrounds, character sprites, and CGs.  I thought the music was pretty good as well and the various tracks did a good job of integrating appropriately with the scenes. Also, the game contains fully voiced dialogue in the original Japanese. Though I do not speak Japanese, I felt that the voice over did provide an added emotional depth to the conversations.  I only have a couple of minor criticisms of this game. The first is that it is nearly impossible to get the true ending without some sort of a guide as the decisions the player must make to get to that point are rather arbitrary. The other thing would be that I felt that a couple of scenes just dragged on too long (the RaiNet tournament scene in chapter 7 is probably the worst example of this). But still, these are minor points and did not really detract from my enjoyment of this game.  If you play this, I would suggest going in blind without a walkthrough and just make whatever decisions you think are best. It is worth trying during the first play-through and I certainly enjoyed my first experience playing this.  All in all, I found this to be an excellent visual novel. All aspects of this game just seemed to work right with an engrossing plot, memorable characters, great music, and good art. Though a bit pricey, this game should provide an average player with at least forty hours worth of entertainment. (As of this writing, it took me around forty-eight hours to achieve 100% completion including some backtracking for achievements.) Even if you have never played a visual novel before, this would be a good place to start as it is an exemplary example of the genre. If you do like visual novels, I highly recommend it especially if you enjoy science fiction stories involving time travel."

413030,Mytheon,"After a confusing first few minutes, this turned into a surprisingly addictive and incredibly fun few weeks for a friend and me. I never would have thought that deck building and action RPG could work together so well.  Probably the biggest problem is that the major bosses seem to be balanced for a full group, and 1 or 2 players have almost no hope, at least not until their decks are rather polished.  But the positives far outweigh the negatives. I love that you can put an increasing number of cross-class cards into your deck as you progress. I also love the variety of cards, the atmosphere, and the combos."
413110,Hero's Song, Early Access Review
413410,Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc,this game has a large variety of interesting charac- wait nevermind all the cool ones are dead
413420,Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair,"I really hate this game. Boring dialog click click click.  'Are you ok?' *click*,  'Sure?' *click,  'You look a little pale' *click*,  'Let me see if you are ok' *click*,  'You sure dont look like you are feeling well' *click*  - Head exploding."
413470,Where Angels Cry - Tears Of The Fallen (Collectors Edition),"The cardinal has a mission for you: stop the terror by the hand of an inquisitor in a remote village in Spain. Many innocents people died and it's time for you to understand why he's so interested in an old woman, Miguela. But nothing is easy in that cold town, where the sun never shows itself and where old feuds are strong in the heart of those who fell to hate.  If you played Where Angels Cry, you take back the role of the monk investigating his own brothers (well, in the church, not his own family) that seemed to have lost themselves to whatever vicious feeling they're currently having. However, now, the story is way more elaborated than the first game and is more polished. However, the ending isn't really satisfying. It cuts abruptly and you can only speculate. Even the bonus chapter isn't explaining it, it's more a prequel and an explanation of how the things came to be.  Now, the game is more oriented towards an hidden object setting, as you have scenes of them, that are easy and interesting. Even if Where Angels Cry is standard in this field (find items, use them and solve puzzles), it's more satisfying than in the previous game. Puzzles are easy and well explained. However, there is a major problem: you're often lost at what to do. Even in Casual, with the map showing the actions you need to do, you're asking yourself what you're missing. I got stuck in Ramon's house because the area that I needed wasn't clear. It's just a little disappointment given the great improvement of the game.  And the game improved also in terms of graphics: they're better: the characters seem more alive than in the first game, despite being in a winter decorum, the backgrounds are quite cheerful and colorful, in other words, it seems less outdated. The soundtrack also improved and was way more fitting into the story. However, better graphics don't mean that you can put everything in an hidden object game. I was under the impression sometimes that items were not medieval at all, despite the game being in the 13th century.  Where Angels Cry: Tears of the Fallen is a very good surprise, especially if you played the first game. Everything improved greatly, even if there are still some little problems. However, I've been more 'active' in this opus than the first one. The price is perhaps a little high, even if it's a collector's edition, however, it's still a worthy purchase. If you played Where Angels Cry, I urge you to try Tears of the Fallen, so that you don't stay on your impression of the first game."
413480,101 Ways to Die,"This game made me laugh! I love the presidentail edition with Hillary and Trump, but the original version is just as fun. It's easy to pick up and play, although it gets more clever and creative later on with a mix of great gameplay and dark humour."
413500,Rocket Fist,Bought the game and can't refund...
413540,Recourse,"I'll preface by saying that, at the moment, I don't really feel this game is quite worth its asking price; but if you asked me there are very few games I'd say can justify a $40 pricetag. The game doesn't have enough content nor does it feel quite polished enough for what it wants but the devs are active and constantly updating so that could change in the future.  As a puzzle game, this game is... not too hard, really. The puzzles get bigger more than they get trickier, though the later puzzle levels (8 and on) can certainly provide a decent mental workout. But there's definitely a decent bit of variety, up to continuing to introduce elements even in the last levels of the game. And it does feel like every type of puzzle the game presents is developed about as far as it can be, though there are certainly a few that overstay their welcome. There's a nice feeling of progression throughout though, each level is an interconnected hub of smaller puzzles and picking apart one piece unlocks two more, the real joy is finding the ways all the separate pieces interact with each other to get the secret pickups, honestly.   The combat is... a bit weak honestly, since it's all indirect. You throw deployables that do the fighting for you, at least until you unlock the bonus weapon waaayyy near the end of the game that is. There are really only two or three weapons worth using out of the eight available. And the enemies tend to be an annoyance more than a threat. Death is pretty cheap, either just sending you back to a checkpoint with no penalty or dropping all your collected items in the wave rush and payload levels but allowing you to pick up half of them again, and if you're playing it smart you don't keep a large stash anyways. The wave rush levels in particular feel just a bit unnecessary since the combat is never a strong point, but there's few of them and technically you can finish them all in seconds if you want to. The payload levels are a nice change of pace, there's a time limit but not a very strict one and it's easy to extend it as well. I dig this level style a lot more than the wave rush levels. And I do admire that there's diversity in level types, showing off different aspects of the game. The optional race things that appear in every level are another nice little bonus though there's no incentive to beat the best time and trying to do so tends to be the only real source of frustration in the game.  Where the game really works best is in its movement, which is kept consistently fast allowing you to travel large distances with little hassle. And there's even little quirks of the game engine you're expected to discover and exploit a few times. Movement in this game just feels fun, though if you had to be really precise with it I'm sure it'd wear off, but it's distinctly different for a puzzle game. The other aspect of the game that's particularly memorable is the dialogue between the two main characters, which I enjoyed a lot more than I expected to honestly. There's an air of mystery to the overarching plot that plays well into the conversations, a lot of 'AI not understanding humans' bits that develop into some serious snark towards humanity by the end and plenty of genuinely funny quips. And there's just, so many dialogues too, I haven't even found them all yet I'm sure, even with how much I have found. There's also some nice little easter eggs tucked away that you can get near the end, they're pretty fun to hunt for and decently clever.  The game also looks pretty solid visually though the game's aesthetic is a bit limited, it kind of wears off after a number of hours playing. And the soundtrack is nice for what it is but definitely a bit restricted, since it's the same set of songs playing on loop for the entirety of the game. You'll probably have them all memorized by the time you beat the game. I eventually just turned the music off and used my own music to stop from going insane.  It's definitely a pretty good game but I wouldn't say it's a great one. Regardless I definitely enjoyed playing it and I would recommend it... on sale."
413580,Reverse x Reverse,"A fun and challenging puzzle platformer. Execution gets challenging as you go on, especially when going for faster stage times. Because of the difficulty, devising faster solutions and pulling off tricky manuevers are incredibly satisfying."
413680,Statues,"Sick game, got it on discount for really cheap and hasn't dissapointed especially with price. It gives me the creeps on occasions but is overall a horror game with low value. With that in mind, it was fun :)"
413700,Run Turn Die,"It's a simple little game, where you must turn right or left based on rhythm. It's not as easy as it's seems to be and it takes a while to master it."
413710,Blood and Gold: Caribbean!,"While this is a fun game, sadly I would feel bad giving this a positive review. I love Warband and simply picked it up because it ran on the same engine. It's not a horrible game, it can be fun and it's very low on bugs. But that's where it stops. The more you play the game, the more you realise that this isn't worth the price. The game gets old, fast. Even compared to something like With Fire and Sword, its very boring and repetitive stuff. Some of the radiant quests you get from the man in the tavern are fun, but even then there're very few types, and many are just straight up boring or broken. (IE, stand behind a wall for 5 minutes to take over a mine, still never fixed the good 'ol M&amp;B AI). This game just feels like a polished mod for Warband. It's not a complete broken mess and most of the content is there, but just not enough. Plus, even when I can get great frames in Warband, this game will lag my PC, so there are also some optimization problems as well. But then again, this game has one major feature that none of the other Mount and Blade games don't : Boobs. So if you like to waste $200 to disappoint some random prostÍtute after slaughtering some Frenchmen, then this is for you.   Jokes aside, I would skip this game until there're more opportunities for fun gameplay like in the other games, or until there's a more active modding community to give this game some content."

413870,Sickness,"These kinds of darkly themed games are right up my alley, but with this one having so few reviews on Steam, I didn't know what to expect. I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I ended up liking it. I play visual novels pretty sparingly because they bore me if they're too lighthearted, focused entirely on romance, or have overly perfect and sweet characters. This one, however, had my attention all the way through.  I will say that it didn't feel like there was a whole lot of choices, but I liked the story enough to not care. It was much more intriguing than I thought it was going to be. I liked nearly all the characters and their personalities were very believable. Most of the art is pretty good. Not always perfect, but certainly passable. The soundtrack was nothing memorable to me but it suited the game well. Took me just under 8 hours to finish one playthrough. I think anyone that likes a twisted story would appreciate this one."
41400,Doom Rails,Best game i've played by a long shot.  10/10 should trust review  'extremely fun' - ign  'five stars' - pcgamer 'fluent gameplay' - machinima 'impressive graphics' - anandtech
414060,iso-Sphere,Well the most frustrating and rage inducing game i ever tried.Maybe i am an idiot but the controls are just not good enough to do the the levels where you have to be fast because the tiles break after like 2 seconds under you.The ball feels too much unresponsive to be able to stop it at the precise moments. Okay there are levels where i can take the slower aproach( i will never think about doing the time records) but where you have to be fast and do things with good relflexes the controls feel to unreponsive for fast movements.Or maybe it is the phisics of the ball that it needs some time to stop or turn so maybe it is me only that are not used to these kind of games but it is realy hard for me maybe i should try it with a controller and would have better results.  So all in all if you like hard(i mean realy hard at least in my point of view) games where you need good control skills and good reflexes you will have a good time with this game and i recommend it but for those who can't take multiple fails in seconds steer clear or you will rage like hell(or like me).So for gamers who like casual puzzles i wouldn't recommend it even if it is saying casual in the game tags.

414370,Raining Blobs,"I just tried it out, but the controls are so strange and the menu layout isn't really a good help, cause it is also pretty confusing. After I studied the well hidden tutorial now, I played another arcade match, which I quitted after a while, because it was too boring to me. The tournament then doesn't seem well balanced. All in all, this game wasn't fun to me, and this is what a game is for. Because of the reasons above I cannot recommend this game."
414500,Caribbean Odyssey,"This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and great game mechanics, the overall sound is good. Keeps you entertained and satisfied."
414510,5089: The Action RPG,"Under-rated game. The previous games were constantly just called off as 'Minecraft clones' because of the graphics, but the '89 series is really something great.   5089 has quite a lot of depth to it, and you can get a lot of replayability out of the game with how much customization there is. I highly reccommend to RPG fans."
414580,Uriel's Chasm 2: את,  I think the trading cards are the core value of this game.
414660,Vampire Legends: The True Story of Kisilova,"One of the weakest Hidden Object games I've played. It's not very bad but I'd not call it good either. My biggest problem with this game is that there is not really any plot reason to do all these puzzles. Most puzzles you can start collecting / combining before you encounter any plot point that would require you to do so. That paints main character as having serious case of OCD. 'There is an unsolved riddle on that table! What? Murderer we were chasing? Can wait. I need to fix this right now!' There is also a character that can help you if you play games with him. 'You are chasing someone that just kidnapped another villager? Sure I'll give you a lantern you obviously need, if you defeat me in shooting contest that is. No, I didn't bring a gun, I'll wait for you to get one from somewhere.' Why? That destroys all sense of urgency.  Also this game involves a lot of leg work. You are quickly opened to a whole map and many puzzles require you to go back and forth between locations on extreme ends of a village. You can use a map to jump between locations but that spoils the fun as it gives you markers where the next thing you can interact with is, which makes this game extremely easy."
414720,Astrox: Hostile Space Excavation,"It is a nice 3-5-hour game although a little grindee. With a reasonable sale, definitely worth buying.  The maps are procedurally generated; however, they are so similar that it does not benefit the game much. I think it could have been a nice 20-hour game if there were a reasonable number of premade maps with some local flavor and light emergent narrative."
414730,Epic Clicker Journey,"A clicker game that tries too hard to be innovative. Lots of its design choices are questionable and the system has little explination. Items have no explination except for a little vague hastag blurb, only one follower at a time, no idle system, and the fact that you need to save gold to buy keys to move forward in the game.  Overall the game feels very unrewarding and confusing and you're better off playing another free clicker on Steam."

414920,Corgi Warlock,"Not actually the game I thought I'd bought - so many games with corgi warlocks in them it's easy to get confused you know! - but a fun platformer with some nice comic book art, not hard enough to cause any real stress just the occasional grrfle moment. Definitely worth picking up for the price."
414950,Star Nomad 2,It's nice..... but to buy the next spaceship with any reasonable amount of cargo spae (greater than 40) you need to have a 200 standing with any faction.... very hard to increase standing. Especially true when you lose standing faster for smuggling than you ever do for gaining... btw how do you gain standing???
41500,Torchlight,"I did prefer over 2, because of simplicity, but the game overwrites extant files with dupes or even deleted characters which means your toon, and all asssociated, is randomly deleted. Perhaps this is a windows thing, I don't know. What I do know is a game where it can just 'randomly' end, and OOP, is a game that effectively sux, even if th3e game itself is good. The game itself is great, but If i wanted to play 'Wheel of misfortune', I would play that by, well, existing."

415140,PD Howler 10,"Editing my review upon finding an solution.  I am not sure exactly what change was made to the installer since Howler 10's release but Steam's intial install process will leave you dead in the water.  If you're having troubles getting Howler to start you will need to find the application folder in Steam Common and browse the subfolders for PD's naked executable installer and run it manually. Your desktop icon will be replaced with the paint brush instead of the Howler dog and should now work.  As for the software itself PD Artist is a great assest as part of a pipeline. I believe those with more of an intellect geared for engineering will be able to use it standalone however some of the most basic manipulation principles, common in digital art applications, are hidden or applied in an obscure manner.  Despite not being user-friendly for intermediates I can still highly recommend owning a copy as a tool to resort to when your works need much more fine-tuning or customized brushes. There are a lot of features buried deep here as Dogwaffle has been in production for as long as I can remember.  As example: I use start my designs with Art Rage; being able to scale, rotate transparent layers quickly then export as png files into Howler for texturing and special FX layering."
415150,Pang Adventures,"The Pang Adventures is remake of one of my favorite games in childhood. I remember I was playing it on arcade machines in early 90s. At first I was sceptical about this Pang Bros adaptation but it turned out the game is really fun and of course catchy as it always was.. Try to play just one ! :) There are new weapons and boss fights. Tried co-up as well and it works great. Some players miss the smallest ballons, but the only thing I miss so far is that recognizable POP! sound when you hit the balloon.. Worth every cent ! Great game !"

There are a lot of strategic options and posibilities to outplay your opponent. I've played this now for a few hours an i can recommend it to anybody. It is free, it has sci-fi and you can earn quite a lot of cards with the campaign (which you get for free) and the quests."

415670,Highrise Heroes: Word Challenge,"This is a competently executed wordgame with a lot of variety. There's action levels. There's turn based puzzle levels. There's even some mathy levels swapping out letters for numbers. The story is not amazing, but it makes moving through the campaign a little more satisfying. If you particularly like a certain type of puzzle, you can just do those. If you don't like the action-y levels, you can turn off the timer. If you want to be competitive you can obsess over a level for hours and try to get a global high score.   Overall, if you want to play a Boggle type game where you find words on a grid, then this game probably has what you want."

415850,BAD END,"Just Finished Playing the Game and receiving all the endings. I am very familiar with Visual Novels from Japan and I have played alot of them.  This one in particular is just a port from Android/iOS Phones for Steam. I later realized this. However, The price point is set very well about how much this game is worth  It is pretty short, took me about 3 hours to get ALL endings, 1 hour for one playthrough to True End. So its better to get this on your phone and play it spurratically IMHO.  -I Purchased this game because I am a huge fan of Survival Horror type games where the Protagonist is mutilated in a variety of interesting ways. This was rather lacking to what I'm used to.   All the Bad Endings are mostly the same with little difference in what happens. Very Unoriginal Bad Endings    For a game called BAD END, only the True end makes the game make sense lol -The BGM (Background Music) was very distracting in key scenes which were supposed to be scary with 'Happy Tones'. So calling this 'Survival Horror' is kinda a joke. -There were very few Unique CGS, but considering the length of the game, understandable. -The plot   breaking the 4th wall and back again was entertaining at first, but was dragged on and on throughout the game.   Personally I have enjoyed stories from Amatuer Visual Novelists better than this, but it was an okay way to spend an hour of life. -Best part of the game is the funny posts you can see in the Discussion community after you play  I recommend you play other Visual Novels instead, use  vndb.org  to find the genre you like best. Steam isn't really the best port for these types of games yet, but the 16:9 / Fullscreen Aspect Ratio was appreciated (Although you would get the same thing on your phone)  If you really want to get this game, it is entertaining for about an hour or so, and I would get it on iOS/Android because of conveinence. Also it IS made to be a mobile game."

Releasing a game that does not respond to a common contol device suggests a lack of knowledge and skill by devs.   Conceptually clever but poor implementation.  Unless you are still running a command line system avoid this product."
41600,Earthworm Jim 3D,This game is GROOVY!
416030,Your Quest,"Don't ever ask me why... just another one of thoose K1ngu1n deals we players have once in a while... this came... i tryed it... i am no really fan of rpg's but the ones i play do usually have confortable controls, a nice hud, a cool art style and a enjoyable theme song or even a soundtrack so great that melts me with pleasure... ( 100% no sarcasm :P ); In 'Your Quest' Though... its totally different... and i fell like i should say that this is a constructive opinion of myself... by no means i pretend to make anyone mad or even upset the developer... i bet this was a hard working game by a man standing alone, but in a world full of big acomplishments we have to stop 'over crediting' the weaker ones , be reallistic, and therefore make thoose ' weaker ones' grow up with a more inteligent mindset, this said, lets proceed: to be honnest, this game made me fell a little bit depressed, the graphics could be brighter, collourfull and funnier, the design looks way too simple, the music is quite boring and the battle/crafting system feels heavy, boring and a bit complicated,the only really good thing that it brings is the very own idea of making one rpg... there arre a few on the market... some better some equal in quallity... i could see theese ideas being so helpfull to the gaming community, still, i hope that after i criticise this game so much it can improve... or maybe motivate someone to do a better Rpg... ho knows?     -Fanone, the most dyplomatic gamer of all thoose ho kinda live ^^ :P cya ;3"
416040,CLASH,"Would be 6/5 if there were bots and players, RIP"
416080,God Game : The Odyssey,"Kinda interesting but also kinda boring game. Look, if you like clicker games, this one is for you, most probably. I kind of like clicker games, like 12 labors of hercules, but that one is a lot more fun for me. This is kind of boring, but also kind of different than other clicker games. But I just farmed trading cards and deleted"
416110,Blitz Breaker,+ Nice music + retro 8-bit style - Doing the same again and again to finally get that level done - Waiting to fall down  NOT MY GAME! Maybe this is something for speedrunners
416130,Written in the Sky,really nice its too short though :v
416180,Gun Bombers,Great multiplayer either co-op teams or total versus mode! I've had so much laughter with this game when played against my friends! Definitely worth the buy!
416190,Vehicle Simulator,"  I do not own nor have I operated a real sailboat. The sailboats here are just fine. I am sure there are a list of things missing from a real sailing trip but I was able to leave the dock in less than 30 seconds. That does not happen in real life. I did not need a shower when I reached land. No one cares where or how I park the boat. If You are thinking of getting a boat and have never owned pne, get this first. Get this to see what is involved in boating even on a simulation scale. The $20 You spend on this will easily pay for itself when You are reading real life boating information.  The aircraft get a biased review. Flight simulation is my second favorite form of simulation. The F86 is all I've flown so far. I almost had it lined up for an unexpected carrier landing until gravity and water turned my plane into future coral.  We can make our own vehicles. I have not yet experimented with that because nothing else would get done today.  edit: added a video to this review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U9yM4Q5KlM "
416200,Door To Door,"Absolutely stunning!   Door To Door is a first-person RPG experience that combines surreal environments, atmospheric soundscapes, a unique blend of comedy and suspense storytelling, and diabolical jazz all in one industrial sci-fi labyrinth!   Simply, this game is a must-have for any RPG fan.  The Lounge District is magnificent achievement in architectural engineering, a perfect example of what an independent producer can create...  Best Independent Game of 2016   Great work CD Jones!  5/5 Stars  --  '...Wash a window or sweep a floor, there's no greater joy; than going Door To Door... '  — Ministry of Mottos"
416210,Block'hood, Early Access Review
416220,The Light Empire,Feels more like a beta or alpha version than a finished game. Really bad interface makes everything take longer than it should. It's also missing a lot of tutorials meaning there's a lot of trial and error just to figure things out. Not really what you want in a rogue-like. There's also a lot of unnceessary waiting time.
416240,Space Impossible, Early Access Review
416250,Tales [PC],"Long, long time ago, I frequently visited AGS-games and played all the free adventures (this was in the time before the marketing started and there literarally were no AGS-games that costed money), I was a real addict and played everything I could. Now, years later, I still love good adventure games; I stress out: 'good' ones.  This game is not very well made. The story begins rather lame, the puzzles aren't original or at least interesting, The graphics look really nice, but the animations are horrble and really slow , the dialogues are boring, it isn't worth playing in any way, in my opinion, compared to many, many really great adventure games.  A game like this shouldn't cost money. If people have a hobby called developing adventure games: nice!  If they want to earn money with their hobby, they should perhaps learn how to do it properly.  Just look at Wadjet Eye Games, they started as part of the AGS-community and boy, what great games they've made! Here I don't see any of this potencial at the moment. If you watch the trailer, it really looks like a fantastic game with superb voice acting et cetera; playing it, it doesn't give you, what it promises.  Also the trailer shows you, that pretty much people for such a game were involved.  But this didn't help the essence of the game to be enjoyable. Perhaps it's just not my cup of tea; I find too many flaws that ruin my gaming experience to get hooked to the game and I don't want to give it another try, because it's just mediocre in an unacceptable way."
416260,The Lost Island, Early Access Review
416290,Bleeding Border,"Nice game!!  Looks alright (it's not the best looking game but neither is Fallout 4, which by the way has more bugs and it's more pricey) and runs smoothly!! It has a lot of blood and some nice horror moments.  Hope we get a sequel some time, to see how the story unfolds!!!!  It's great to see a new studios making games. "
416310,Goblin Defenders: Steel‘n’ Wood,"I just don't like it. At some point difficulty spikes to hell. A map can take up to 40 minutes and when I lose on 35th wave out of 40 waves, I just don't want to repeat that. Interface icons are too big and overlap with your turrets, so in certain cases they can't be upgraded. The view of the map is a bit too small. You can make a maze with your turrets, but flying enemies will fly over them and can spoil your plan on early waves = repeating a map. Directions for enemies are not clear enough at start = repeating a map. There are too many colours - everythings seems to sting your eyes and it can be hard to focus. There is a nice variety of enemies. Turrets are nice and have levels of upgrades (damage, reach, reload time). There is campaing and survival mode. I guess it's a decent game overall, but it's not my thing overall and one level put me off so much that I won't bother myself with this game anymore. I would give it thumbs sideways, but since it didn't entertain me enough I will give it thumbs down (you should fix it Valve). Not bad, but not good enough to recommend. Bye."
416320,Rescue Team 5,Nice Game To Make Your Mind Work and also Fun  Mind + time  Great game
416330,Revolt,"Steam really really REALLY needs a section, seperate from the main store page (like the Software section), to host and, otherwise, corral amateur developers  I would comment on what immediately frustrated me about this game but it's so obvious that  I'm wondering if it was designed intentionally for the sake of getting reactions."
416340,Viking Saga: New World,"the name of the game should be evil boss simulator - you overwork viking dwarves with a series general tasks - The same guy that build a hut collect the taxes! seriously: this is an identical game to 12 works of hercules (which is newer), its more of a puzzle then a strategy game in the classical sense, good way to get distracted - the casual tag is there for a reason, in all fairness grerat game for what it proposed"
416350,MiniBikers,"  I like games like this, ofcourse with gamepad. Unfortunately it's a first game which I can't force using my gamepad property. I can't set accelerate or brake (my minibiker accelerate or brake all the time without my action). Game launcher - nothing. Game setting - nothing, x360ce - no effect, same with JoyToKey and Xpadder. So I give up. Sad :("

416390,Magnetron, Early Access Review
416450,Emporea,"Very fun well designed game... except there's one problem, every 90 days the entire server resets to make it 'new user friendly'. I don't understand why they can just not allow you to attack people of lower levels, but that isn't my choice. I would recommend this game to people that don't really care about 3 months of their life cause this game takes it away. Still a very good and well designed game though, I'm just sad to see such a deal breaking feature"
416530,Tacopocalypse, Early Access Review
416550,Rubber Ducky and the Rainbow Gun,"Wow. This game is only selling for .99c but I still recommend you to hold off from purchasing this fetid piece of ♥♥♥♥. If I had to characterize it, I would say it's like a platformer that got aborted in its fetal state. ♥♥♥♥ that, saying it's an aborted platformer would be too nice.  It was made for some 'Ludum Dare' thing, which perhaps in the context of such a contest it would look better--however, upon looking into the Ludum Dare website, I was confronted with a website that seemed about as terribly organized as this game, so gave up trying.  Regardless of why this game was made, it is terrible. For something with 'gun' in the title, the game isn't as much about shooting things as it is avoiding getting hit by things. The condition for completing a level perfectly is ending with full health, not beating a certain number of enemies or anything else that would make a satisfying win condition. You don't get any points for shooting things and you can pass some levels without shooting hardly anything. The ways in which you beat the levels feel contrived and unsatisfying. It's not skill that wins the games, not even logic, just some gimmicky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you'll end up figuring out by playing over and over. The Rubber Ducky title is also superflous... There's nothing duck-like in the game and the character is just a pixel square that you will never ever feel any love for.  It took 3 levels of play to figure out that the point is to pass the levels with full health. During the 5th level, the Developer blatantly points out that this is pretty much a failed effort without a sound concept. It sounds like he's apologizing almost, but DON'T WORRY--HE'S GOING TO MAKE UP FOR THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. HOW? Oh, by adding the extra challenge of making you find a bunch of stupid secrets laced throughout the levels in order to proceed to the final level. You would think the secrets would take logic and skill to find, that it might at least be one satisfying part of the game attempting to seek them out... but ♥♥♥♥ NO. One or two secrets took minimal thought to accomplish, the rest happened by accident for me and could hardly be called secrets at all. It's nothing like finding an easter egg... the Dev merely forces you to do some trivial task like exit on the left side of the screen instead of the right or some other equally pointless task. None of this effort was satisfying to me and I was annoyed that someone made me go through the motions just to see if the ♥♥♥♥ing game would pick up... IT DOESN'T.  What else can I add to the list of ♥♥♥♥ this game pours forth? How about Achievements for clicking a link to follow this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on twitter? I clicked a little bird icon thinking it was a secret that I had to check out, but NO... it pushed me out of game and tried to link me up with Twitter and said I obtained a 'social media addict' achievement... right before the ♥♥♥♥ froze my computer. Another achievement just for buying the game.... (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). The game also seemed to lag at certain points in some levels.  If the gameplay itself wasn't annoying enough, it gets worse because you have to listen to the developer narrate the game controls in what he feels is a humorous banter, which is really just annoying. This is especially so since when you have to redo a level, you have to click through the multiple frames of text in order to get to another unsatisfying level. Also, have the time the narrator speaks as if talking to the audience and half the time he speaks as if to the player.. This isn't a problem, except on the damned Ludum Dare site, he described this game as 'a dialog between the ever-silent Rubber Ducky and his eccentric developer, all made to hopefully make you smile!'  NO--this game doesn't make me smile. I feel less intelligent for having played it. The fact that you're charging for a piece of ♥♥♥♥ soundtrack to boot is ♥♥♥♥ing LUDICROUS. The fact that you throw in trivia about your game development efforts into the narration of this game and blatantly try to use this just to advertise yourself seems idiotic, since people will now be aware that you made a REAL ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. You didn't have to bring our attention to it.. you could have been nice to yourself. Let your friends donate to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ project through paypal or something, don't try and rip people off on steam. 'LOOK MOMMY! I CAN SELL A PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ ON STEAM AND PEOPLE WILL BUY IT! I'M A ♥♥♥♥ING BIG BOY NOW!!!'  I played your game, I made it to the end, I clicked a bunch of ♥♥♥♥, made random graphics appear, and now want to slam my head in the wall...... *OUCH*"
416590,Emily Wants To Play,THIS GAME WILL KILL ME IRL
41660,Tommy Tronic,i picked up tommy tronic and can not get the game to run. it has alot of issues just trying to start the game
416610,The Growth Journey,The game won't even launch! (Linux related problem?)
416630,True Lover's Knot,"For a VN this one has some pretty major flaws. FOr once thing, the art is sub par. The characters clash with the background more than in most good VNs I played. The characters dont look professionally drawn either.   I could forgive that if the writing was good, but the pacing is dull and the jokes tend to fall flat. I'll keep playing and hope things get better. Hopefully I'll get my $8 worth."
416640,Diabolical,Pretty fun. Kinda linear but a good read regardless.  I like the humour too. Had me laughing out loud multiple times
416670,Gunslingers, Early Access Review
416680,Zombie Night Terror,"Loved the game, then hated the game. I can only watch my precious undead minions be blown away so many times."
416690,Oh...Sir! Prototype,"This little game could seriously use some actual British voice actors. I know that this is from a game jam and made in 42 hours, but man, these badly spoken lines with a very thick Eastern European accent (Polish I presume) are like nails on a chalkboard and ruin most of the fun for me.  Shouldn't be too hard find someone with a british accent and a decent microphone online and re-record these lines and patch them in."
416720,Toro,"Hello, I'm a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ right now, because some idiot gamers in the review section have said that this game is cruel toward animals. First off, grow some balls you pansies ☺. This game is just a virtual depiction of a sport very sacred in my culture. So maybe before criticizing the treatment of bulls, think about whether you may or may not be being a racist.  Now to the game, because that's the important part of this review:  Some of you kids seem to think that a virtual bull being stabbed in its rump is more vile than actually eating your stupid hamburgers you stupid American fatsos. Now ♥♥♥♥ you. I'm a little mad because we should be talking about the game when you little tiny idiots are so small you can't even comprehend the importance of this sport you miniature idiots. Maybe you Dwarven smurf petite dinky microscopic nerds can read up on wikipedia because I don't have time to educate you paltry gnomes. Lil baby boys. Puny.  So about the game:  This is a 8.7/10 but pip-squeak idiots like the ones in this review section wouldn't be able to comprehend that because their brains are tiny as heck.  The sound is fantastic. The graphics remind me of the good ol' days of gaming (retro). Twerps.   Maybe in the audience next time you could add some scantily-clad women (because when I used to bullfight there would be ladies in the crowd displaying breasts). It was Spain so we called them 'señoritas'.   Maybe you Americans would benefit from immersion in another culture, instead of bathing in your mountain dew and baby sweat and tears because Mom turned off the Nintendo.  P.S. Your ♥♥♥♥ing tiny, dweebs. Lilliputian homunculi.  So peace out, you rat-chasing, dust farming, pint-sized tiny♥♥♥♥s. That's right you shrimpy ant-dicked grass men."
416760,Pay2Win: The Tricks Exposed,"THIS GAME SUCKS BEYOND ALL BELIF. ♥♥♥♥ THOSE POSITIVE POST THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF TIME. ONCE YOU START THE GAME THERE IS AN AUTO SAVE FEATURE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? NO SAVING!!! YOU CAN SPEND HOURS ON THIS GAME AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN 1 SITTING WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE FUNNIENESS ENDS EXTREMLEY QUICKLY AND JUST BECOMES THE MOST ANNOYING THING EVER! AND IF YOU WANT TO COMPLETE ANY QUEST, TOO BAD BECAUSE THIS GAME THROWS SOME LAST MINIUTE ♥♥♥♥ AT YOU SO YOU CANT EVEN COMPLETE THE QUEST! DONT BUY THIS GAME! IM SERIOUS THIS ISNT A FUNNY COMMENT THIS IS REAL. DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
416770,SquareCells,Great game with nice music
416790,The Metronomicon: Slay The Dance Floor,"It's a rhythm game without much rhythm management. Heroes have abilities, but you have no idea what they would do, as you're focusing on the rhythm. Music is only mediocre."
41680,Death and the Fly,"This game has a major problem, and has had for as long as I've owned it. Multiple computers, graphics cards, and operating systems all seem to have the same glitch, which makes the game nearly unplayable. If I had not purchased it long ago, I'd have asked for a refund."
416800,Cluck Yegger in Escape From The Planet of the Poultroid,Jump Scares :O
416850,Astral Gun,"This game is absolutely fantastic. I went over my friend's place and was instantly hooked. We spent a lot of time combining our weapons. Astral gun is something that's easy to pick up, but difficult to master. The skill ceiling is insanely high and the ability to customize your ships to suit your own skillset opens up a lot of opportunities to outplay each other. For only 2 dollars it offers a surprising amount of depth. Astral gun is the perfect local multiplayer game to pull out with your friends and I highly recommend this game to anyone!"
41700,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat,"This is great game and the modding community makes it even better. This game even 7 years later still holds up as one of the best survival games. Some great mods to consider are: Ray Of Hope Radium Call of Chernobyl Misery Mod And there is a pretty good remake of the original stalker called Lost Alpha. Even years later i could personally recommend this game to many people as with all of the mods that the community is making, This game can be made to seem new and fresh."
417060,UnSummoning: the Spectral Horde,"I like these types of games but the controls did not feel precise and after a couple minutes I did not have the patience to learn what kind of lag in response I was going to get when moving around. Considering how vital it is to do precise moves, the feeling and responsiveness of the controls should be perfect. Using a keyboard did not help.  I came back and tried again a few weeks later but it was no better and I gave up even sooner.  I have a high end PC and there is no reason why this game should feel laggy and I chalk it up to poor design."
417110,Mayjasmine episode01 What is God? 五月茉莉,♥♥♥♥♥♥ loli game with broken english    10/10
417150,Pavilion,"Let me start with the good things about Pavillion: It has very atmospheric graphics, and it captures a nice surreal feeling. It's enjoyable to look at the scenery and plot a course through the levels.  Unfortunately, it does have several limitations. The core mechanic is moving a cursor to interactable objects. But the mouse can not be done to do this. The simple interaction means that the puzzles are on the easy side -- even the hard ones are more of a matter of precise timing or smart navigating instead of logical brain-twisters. For the price, it's a very short game; I finished in just over 2 hours. The story is implicit rather than explicit -- but this means you're wandering around the ruins without a stong sense of who you are, why you are here, and what you want.   Worse of all, just as you start piecing together what you think might be going on, Chapter 1 is over and now you wait (and likely pay) to experience Chapter 2."
417290,Ghost of a Tale, Early Access Review
41740,Cargo! - The quest for gravity,Have you ever thought to yourself 'Boy! I sure wish there was a video game where I could build vehicles in order to entertain a bunch of naked midgets at the behest of some metal tiki mask gods that look exactly like Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot'?   ...Me neither!
417430,Moto Racer  4,Moto Racer is back!!
417480,Marcus Level,"This game is not good. Boring stages, boring achievments, boring music, boring everything. The hit detection is really messed up..I can jump on an enemies head sometimes and be successful while other times I die. I've encountered so many glitches too I can't even count them. If you jump in an area that wasn't meant to be jumped in, then you get stuck and have to restart. I've gotten stuck in the goal as well because you move faster when you sword jump. I did a sword jump right before the goal a couple of times and got stuck in the wall. It's pretty much a mess. It feels more like a flash game or a game meant for phones. Kids may find this fun, but If you're an adult and enjoy platformers, stay away at all costs."
417540,Gamefuel Driver Control,"Fully recomend!!!  This program scans and does find out of date drivers even for things that windows is suppose to manage like generic mouse and generic keyboard.  For me it fixed an issue i had with my USB driver.  Word of caution!!! So of the places the drivers come from dont make sense.  EX) it said my Hard Drive was critaical out of date and under source of update it gave me a website to small bussiness.   just do what you always do when you update, learn why its being updated."
417750,Left Alone,At first I was kind of skeptical about this game but after giving it a shot and actually having a chance to talk to the development team I do in fact have to recommend this game. It's quite different from any conventional horror game with out right now and kind of takes his own approach if you're looking for something that is going to scare you without all the cliches safe from Resident Evil or whatever this game is right for you it's only a few bucks and honestly you're supporting the small Indie Development Group. 10 out of 10 would buy again  Pros: +The scenery is very well done +The story is spot on +Runs perfect  +i was so scared at times.
417840,Mysterious Castle,"Wish I'd read the reviews before buying. Absolute waste of money for £3.99.  Game was too short, not even an hours game play. Was also glitchy meaning I had to restart a couple of levels as it wouldn't let me click.  Puzzles were too simple and it makes our that level 10 is a level by letting you click 'play' but its not a real level. So in effect only 9 levels."
417860,Emily is Away,i realized that i intendedly friend-zoned myself.
417880,Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,"**** Discusses details, but no true spoilers. ****   There's one question  you have to ask yourself before you begin this game: Does the slow pace of walking sims attract or repel you?  If you can't stand a walking sim's pace, you won't like this game. And if you review it, you'll whine about how slow it is and you will thereby deserve to burn eternally in hell for ignoring my advice. I don't like professional sports. What do you think would happen if I presumed to review a football or basketball sim? I wouldn't like it. And my opinion would be  entirely effing worthless , because I should never have reviewed the thing in the first place, lacking a basic sympathy for it. Just as your opinion is  entirely effing worthless  if you basically don't like walking sims.  If you are able -- notice that I don't say 'willing,' you can't will yourself to change your tastes -- if you are  able  to let yourself sink into a story and absorb it slowly through a multitude of environmental details, hints, and suggestions, and to sort out the tangles when you trigger story information in the wrong order, as you will -- it is superb.  June, 1984. You're in a picture-perfect little English village, the type you're used to seeing in glossy magazines. And it's empty. Why? Well, the world just ended. Again, why? That's what drives the story, but the story isn't a story, it's an interlayered and intermingled series of tales of the people who lived here, the crisis they faced, how they reacted to it, and how some of the may have helped it to happen by their snobbish insularity. The story is told in six chapters, beginning with the village priest, Father Jeremy, and ending with Kate, the American astronomer who married a local man and came back with him to work in the observatory near their village. The human characters express themselves through swirls of light which re-enact scenes from their lives and interactions, allowing us to watch the development of what has already taken place.  'Rapture' is a lyrically depressing game, often shading into tragic. For me, the most hanky-worthy moment was Rachel's final scene. She's a bit of a 'bad' girl because of a supposedly dodgy boyfriend, but when an irresponsible couple abandon their baby to her care in an attempt at a speedy flight (which ends badly), her boyfriend stays by her. In her last scene, she's trying to rock the baby to sleep while struggling with the realization that it's all over, whatever is happening, none of them is going to survive it, sobbing through the words of her lullaby, 'When we're called, we needs must go...' but still considerate enough to tell another who comes to see if she needs help that he ought to get some sleep himself. And then all of them are gone.  One point that isn't made sufficiently clearly is that Kate is black. Her encounter with Wendy, the local busybody whose main retirement hobby seems to be minding the business of others with an unhealthy intensity, is a masterly depiction of hyper-refined bigotry, an unprovoked insult carried out from sheer racist spite covered with a gloss of 'niceness.' But of course it isn't Kate's skin color that is the problem, she explains later. It's just that 'she won't fit in here.' That attitude may have ended up being a major reason the world has ended. But there are a lot of other candidates.  The village is done in magnificient detail, and the score by Jessica Currie is by turns ominious, lyrical, and mournful, funeral music for a world. The ending is a bit difficult to understand, but one must remember that the sole witness was not necessarily entirely sane at that point. Too often, criticism hinges on confusions and mistakes that would be natural for a character to make.  So by all means play it -- if you like the genre. If not, avoid it. You'll be missing nothing but a headache and the scorn of those who realize that like an anaconda swallowing a baseball, or me trying to throw one, you took on something that wasn't meant for you in the first place."

418030,Subsistence, Early Access Review
418040,hocus," Ow my head!   Hocus is a masterpiece! I couldnt play a game more addicting than this. If your tired or bord, go play hocus :P Its on mobile too so you can take it on the go! Just to add, once you finish the game, and that alone is fun and hard, you can make your own levels and share levels with others! I have never seen such a mind puzzling game  The only issues I have and this only applies to the steam version of the game are the bugs. Sometimes it will just stop your cube randomly but you get used to it and it will fix in a second. Also the borders and resolution could be managed but its a simple fix. You most likely can adjust the resolution in your launch options on steam.  If I were you I would get this game. For 99 cents (US) It is perfect fun!"

418110,MoW: Face Off XL, Early Access Review
418120,Cally's Caves 3,"If you'd asked me a week ago, I would have *raved* about this game, and given it eight thumbs up. Unfortunately, enough game play inside Cally's Caves 3 revealed what most gamers dread: bugs and game glitches. Enough glitches to be problematic and thoroughly ruin what could have been a stellar game. And the developer is nowhere to be found. He promised a year or so ago to resolve some of Cally's issues, yet seems to have completely abandoned the game. So what's left is an enjoyable platformer with overly frustrating issues such as weapon upgrade glitches and artifact collecting gone wrong. It's still pretty good, all things considered...but if you're after Steam achievements? Nearly impossible."
418150,The Madness of Little Emma,ok so how did no one mention there is no fullscreen? like really this the full release of the game with no fullscreen or decent controller support?!?! its not even good its just BOI but with bad controls i dont get why people are praising this game.

418180,Tempest,Gameplay 8/10 Atmosphere 8/10 Music 8/10 Graphics 8/10 Replayability 8/10  A very good 8/10 fun pirate game and for the price its a steal!
418190,Helen's Mysterious Castle,I liked this game. It was a quick fun little RPG that didn't require too much thought. You could get though it in an hour or so if you wanted. The dialog was corny but funny and overall I enjoyed it.
418240,Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,This game is dank...so addictive..This reminds me of commandos but in edo period :v
418250,Polaris Sector,"So disappointed, as a regular customer of Slitherine and Matrix strategy game I thought, yes a new game and purchasaed it immediately.Right jumped onto the tutorial and was appalled, the graphics are like old style Master of Orion, I saw no evidence that this game utilised any tech from the last 10 years,I know your saying as I did your not bothered about the graphics so long as the gameplay is present but seriously this looks rubbish.The tutorial is light on information and without tooltips any game like this is an uphill struggle, innovative tech system my left one, its over complicated and I found myself slipping into a coma just from the tutorial.I tried to form a fleet of 3 ships to engage the enemy and it said no because they all wernt pointing in the same direction ???? can you imagine insisting on that in mid battle in a modern game its ridiculous. Just for the record I didnt have the game bought for me its my hard earned disability money and at £26.99 its a bad joke, £4.99 maybe but knowing what i know now I wouldnt even pay that.  I liked the ship design section for its simplicity, but was concerned about its lifespan with all the much improved competition around.   I love 4x and overall the parent companys record is excellent, but this, sorry a definite no from me."
418260,Gumball Drift,"The driving and drifting mechanics are fun but lack depth. The physics are fun for turning but the braking and understeering punishment seems harsh. I'm a fan of drift culture but this is short lived. It feels like sound effects are missing and some solid progression.   The physics are fun and so is driving the cars but it will get stale very fast. The game feels a bit empty. I hope they add more features, UI elements, sound effects, and I would love a POV camera just for fun."
418280,Retaliation,"What a inferior game it is! When I am in the town hall , I pressed SPACE . Then the character jumped up but never down!!! Even though we have no need to spend money on a free game , Please don't make me stuck on the air. (NO OBVIOUS BUG)"
418300,Wick,"This game is not worth the prize. I mean it has some nice sound effects and some nice scares, also graphics are nice but the gameplay becomes very quickly boring. :( Edit: Controller support works perfectly, which makes it double disappointing, since I was happy that it worked so good, but doesn't help that the game is boring. :(  Das Spiel lohnt für den Preis nicht. Coole Grafik, gruselige Soundeffekte und ein paar tolle Jumpscares, aber das Gameplay wird schon nach 30 Minuten sehr eintönig und langweilig. Da helfen auch die Jumpscares nicht mehr. Edit: Der Controller Support funktioniert wunderbar, was mich sehr erfreut hat. Macht es aber doppelt so schade, dass das Spiel an sich nichts taugt.   Schade. Hatte mich schon gefreut. :("

418430,Survive Me Miolhr, Early Access Review
418440,Tick Tock Isle,"This is a super casual and short game that's worth the play for some relaxing fun. Getting through the house and island can be repetitive at times, but the mini level games are really cute and fun to play.   Play this if you want some short and simple fun to while away the time."
418520,SculptrVR,"  Wow. Just wow.  This software is fantastic. I received a key from the developer in order to test the hang glider locomotion, but I plan to buy a couple copies to give to friends.   This game's controls and tools are incredibly intuitive, other than the water spawner, though I'm told by the dev that that is something in the works.  In addition, the hang glider is probably my favorite form of locomotion in any game I've played in VR so far. It works exactly as you expect it would, and it's fantastic to fly around like Mario with the wing cap in Super Mario 64.  If you want a fun game where you build worlds and explore them with friends in VR, this one is highly suggested."
418610,Swiftly,"Usually I like hard platformers but this game is just bad. The controls aren’t fun and feel inert and the levels are designed horrible hard. This game is so hard and not fun I didn’t even finish level 1. If you are looking for an abstract platformer get Thomas was alone, Love or Geometry Dash."
418620,The Takeover, Early Access Review
418640,Iron Commando,"Disclaimer: My playtime is not accuratly represented (Steam does not track playtime in offline mode.)  If you want to learn how to play, I explain a lot about this game in my video:  https://youtu.be/UQxUUhGT4-M   Pros:  + Good variety of weapon types with their own strengths and weaknesses (club/bat works great against snakes) + You have everything you need to deal with the mob type enemies (if you're constantly using the jump kick, you're playing wrong. Moving up or down the screen to dodge and grab enemies so that you can then throw them at their friends is where it's at) + Seperate button which is dedicated to picking up items (in almost every beat em up, punch is how you pick up items and it gets you killed. If you get hit while picking up an item in this game, it's completly your fault and I like that about it) + Co-op (if one player dies they steal one of your lives, this may sound bad but it makes it so you both get to keep playing together. If you don't like it you can turn it off in the options) + From a machanics standpoint, this game is very unique (feels a lot like Legend, made by the same company)  Cons: + Unless I turn everything else off, this game does not run smoothly (might not run smooth for you no matter what you do) + Popping audio noise that happens often (I couldn't figure out how to get rid of it) + This game couldn't destinguise one Xbox360 controller from another (I had to play with a keyboard so my brother could use the controller) + If you have a weapon and you're close to an enemy you'll punch instead of use the weapon. This isn't a problem, but sometimes you'll punch even though no enemy is close. (It really messed me up a few times since I was trying to shoot across the screen but punched and got shot instead) + There are 3 autoscroll levels (maybe you like these, but I hate them) + On 2nd to last level, where the ceiling begins to fall and you have to break the giant door, my game got stuck at that part and would not allow me to move out of that section (this happend to me twice, I don't know if it was due to the ceiling hitting me or because I threw grenades. You have to break that door before the celing gets you or it's game over)  Conclusion: I put this game in my wishlist and bought it on sale, because I'm cheap. Much like the other beat em up made by this company (Legend) I didn't like Iron Commando when I first played it. You do have to get used to this game to start appreciating it. It rewards you for being good at it and punishes you when you're trying to get away with lame tactics (just my opinion). So long as your system runs this game smoothly, I think you'll grow to love this game."
418650,Space Pirate Trainer, Early Access Review
418670,Pankapu,The controls can be pretty bad. (playing with controller)
418910,Idle Civilization, Early Access Review
418950,DreadOut: Keepers of The Dark,I really enjoy playing this game.. lots of jumpscare. But the story of the game really short i just finish it in 4 hours like that (without banish all the keepers). The story lead to kill the serpent mistress is really short.. If Digital Happiness wanna make more games like this maybe there should make it more longer such as the first Dreadout game. But still the game is really enjoyable and scary. I going to gave this game 90/100 :)
418960,Catorize,"Very awkward controls that are more at home on a touchscreen, especially since you're expected to not just launch the cat 'Angry Birds' style, but also do that to change direction while in flight.  I cannot recommend this game."
41900,The Bard's Tale,Funny as hell. This game has the humor and rythem to keep most entertaind.
419080,Bridge Constructor Stunts,  Game itself its awesome but the control keys are awful and the automatic spins spoil everything .  Great potencial thougth
419090,Vector Strain,"There's no ♥♥♥♥ing reason why I should turn down my graphics in a bullet hell game just to make the framerate better.  It's mediocre, it feels amateur.   bleck."
419460,"That Dragon, Cancer","This game is absolutely stunning. What an amazing way to tell a story, or in this case share your story! I was immediately drawn in and found myself both celebrating Joel's life and sharing in the families grief. I don't know what else to say. There are a few bugs that forced me to restart chapters but those couldn't out weigh what I just experienced."
419480,Starpoint Gemini Warlords, Early Access Review
419500,Red Game Without A Great Name,"When I first started, I thought the game was bugged because I couldn't make the bird warp, no matter how much I clicked and dragged the mouse around the screen. I tried finding some sort of options menu for the controls, but there was nothing to let me know what I was doing wrong. I eventually figured it out and it turns on you have to start every warp by clicking and holding on the actual bird.  I don't really like the idea that I have to rapidly and continuously move the cursor back to the exact same spot where the bird is every time I want to move him around, especially since the camera is living its own life and the bird doesn't stay in the center, but I suppose the game would be incredibly easy otherwise, since that's the only challenge there is to the game.  That's all I can say about the gameplay really, because that's more or less all there is to it.  The scenery looked good on the video and I like the way it looks, but once I got ingame it all appeared increadibly low-res. The music is okay, but there doesn't seem to be any overall theme, it's just random tracks playing on each level.  Personally, I refunded the game and In the end I think I'll just go back and play a couple of rounds in Super meat boy."
419590,Tales from the Void,Just boring in my my opinion. Controls can be a bit funky and it's just slow. Wouldn't recommend.
419810,House of Hell,Its hard to either recommend or not recommend this game because of how bare bones it is. If you like fighting fantasy gamebooks and don't own a physical copy (or want a digital copy) of House of Hell then get this. That's all it really is. Its a shame I played the Sorcery! games first since they (and Warlock on Firetop Mountain) adapt the game books a lot better than this does. It adds music but otherwise doesn't add animations nor does it include much new art.   In Summary: 2 fear points out of 5

420060,Candle,"background and foreground objectives not always clear, but still a joy to discover...very layered critical thinking so id recommend an age in double digits to be successful...nice homage to Hieronymus Bosch"
420070,Kill The Plumber,"A clever twist on NES-era puzzle sidescrollers with a challenge that ramps up quickly. Each level is short, although some of the more frustrating ones may take many tries to complete. It's a good game for those who enjoy striving for impeccable timing. I enjoyed this form for taking short breaks from work, as the game doesn't demand too much investment at any particular time.  The controls are playable, although not optimal, and some of the challenge of the game comes from dealing with this imprecision. The game is also relatively short, and replayability seems limited. But still a fun one for the library given the price."
420100,CLANNAD Side Stories,"I watched the anime and I fell in love with CLANNAD. Then I played the visual novel and I fell in love with CLANNAD again. More recently, I went through CLANNAD Side Stories and I fell in love with CLANNAD once more.  If you love CLANNAD, then CLANNAD Side Stories is absolutely a worthwhile investment. If you don't love CLANNAD, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can give you an unbiased opinion on whether you should buy CLANNAD Side Stories."

420210,KRUM - Edge Of Darkness,Can't say it was great. Clunky with some performance issues.
420270,Into the Void,"This game doesn't do good explaining anything that needs to happen. It just throws you into a gameplay menu and then you're on your own. I didn't enjoy this game because of that and because of the werid battle system, just couldn't figure it out and it made me mad.  Refunded forsure."
420300,The Admin,"The Admin is a hybrid third person shooter and hack n slash; with a lot going for it in terms of looks but zero substance elsewhere.  Storywise, there is no coherent storytelling in game at all. The gamepage says you play as a cyborg called 'The Admin' who has to keep a facility running. I thought I was a robot just killing creatures on the moon.  Gameplay is VERY basic. You click your left mouse button to slash (up to 3 times) and hold the right mouse button to aim your gun and left mouse button to shoot your gun. You have 4 special attacks with cooldowns and that is it. You can level up your character with XP gained from completing missions, but it doesn't improve the gameplay at all, just makes the game a little easier.  After the first 5 minutes, the game just becomes boring to play with no in depth combat system such as having combos. Also the targeting of enemies in this game is horrible and I would miss alot of times when I went to attack something with my sword.   The game looks really pretty, due to being developed on the Unreal Engine 4, but it is poorly optimized. My rig has an i7-6700k and a RX480 and the game would dip below 10fps after the first level on high.  As far as I got in this game, I heard ZERO soundtracks for this game, it is just dead silence in terms of music. The game might have been a bit more enjoyable with some kind of soundtrack.   I got through the first 5 missions of the game and just quit because I was bored out of my mind. Took me about 87 minutes to get through the first 5 missions (excess time that you see is from farming cards).  So overall, the only feature The Admin has going for it is the graphics. It lacks an in depth combat system, music and optimization. Save your money and go try out Warframe instead, which is free."
420360,Spectrum,  Cute little 'platformer' that ramps up in difficulty pretty quickly!
420380,The Strike,This is the one! Oldie but goodie. Controller force feedback on a strike. That's fishing. Nuff said.
420440,Atlantic Fleet,"Definitly not a simulator, but not entirely arcade either. Wouldn't call it a good game, but worth it if on discount.  Pros:   Decent capital-ship vs capital-ship gameplay.   Not too difficult, easy to get into.  Cons:   Planes poorly modelled, and more of a minigame   Torpedos poorly modelled (chance to fail merely RNG based, and does not depend on angle-of-impact; torpedos loaded within 2 turns)   Submarines poorly modelled (can launch torpedos at a 90° angle without a problem; can disengage simply by diving, even with several destroyers having SONAR contact). Combined with the poor torpedos, this means that it's often a better idea to just sink a submarine with torps, than risk getting one-hit-killed by a torp, head on, 2 turns after he fired a full salvo of torps - which isn't even enough time to reach him for a depth-charge attack between reloads, unless already so close that the torp hits before it's your turn again...   Ships can only use one kind of weaponary per turn - rendering medium artillery on battleships nearly useless, and also meaning that you cannot start an air strike without ceasing fire with one ship for a turn.   Imperial measurement chaos, no way to switch to something sensible (metric, gravitational metric, etc.).  "
420550,Super Arcade Football, Early Access Review
420570,Cubixx HD,"I used to play this on my XBOX 360. It's a 3D version of Qix, basically. The music reminds me of Geometry Wars. Works great with an XBOX controller, too.  Only problem with it is the menus and leaderboards are off-center. The game area is centered, but no matter what resolution I set, there are words off the right side of the screen."
420670,Elite vs. Freedom,Ok i wont say this game is really rubbish or okay but i will suggest this game belongs to tablets and phones. It is really difficult to point out why but i would suggest the dev team revise and look at games like Hounds and max payne etc.  2/5 for the whole concept.
420740,The Deed,"  After playing this game multiple times, I can easily say that this is a great game for it's price for sure! It has a lot of replayability. It's a wonderful game. I would sell my soul for this game.  I deffinately recoment it.  The story will last at about 30 minutes. So if you think about it, it costs £0.01 per minute.  Not bad at all!   9.6/10"
420770,The Legend of Dark Witch,"+ Nicely drawn 2D sprites + Responsible controls - NO full screen (WTF?) - Choppy scrolling, yes it stutters occasionally, which shouldn't happen in such a simple game. It stutters the same way as if you're playing a 50hz game vsynced to 60hz. I'm sure not many will recognize this, but ultra-smooth scrolling in these types of games is essential.  Played for 5 minutes before I quit. Will I ever play again? Maybe, if they fix the scrolling and add a full screen option."
420790,StarBreak,Cool game.But i dont understand the hate 
420840,BLARP!,"This is sort of like that game 'Snake' that came with Windows 95, but the updated modern VR version with a twist! For $2.99, this is a great deal. A physics puzzler with a trippy aesthetic. I can dig it!"
420850,Cosmic Leap,"This game sucks. There is a plot so bad that the game would be better off without one, glitchy gameplay, finnicky movement and controls, and the ending is literally the game telling you to go back and do all the levels that were presented as optional in the beginning just so you can get 1 extra character. Yeah, normally I wouldn't have spoiled that, but you should know the junk you are getting into before you play this.  "

420950,Time Tenshi (2015),  SO.... MUCH..... DIALOG.... WITH.... NO.... VOICE.... OVER... i've been left clickt as fast as possible for the last 5 min and' i'm still not to any actual desiion making points...this is a truely cheap content. 
420970,RoBoRumble,"This game does work properly. outdated graphics (90s game), clunky control, mediocre story, probably you will like this if you have nostalgic feeling of those games in the 90s.. not me, dont throw away your command &amp; conquer game yet."
421040,Plantera,"RECOMMANDED : HIGHLY NOT  This is nice casual clicker but rarely updated and debugged. It's like dev put on sales game and wait about money, no more.  Grinding offline is allowed but severely limited that mean worthless at high level.  At high level you get bored as hell, no ascension or too few content to distract you.  I simply stop to support that dev.  If you plan to buy it for some reason just do it when hard discount."
421050,Deponia Doomsday,Man... I loved this game and all it had to offer (aside from the rapid clicking QTE's) but man... the ending... it was satisfying in that it gave the answers we needed... I can't say too much else lest i spoil the game but all i can say is that the makers of this game make it quite clear what the ending was going to be from the very start
421060,Age of Steel: Recharge,"First off, the good. The game is polished, with a neat pixel art style and an interesting 3-level battlefield.  Unfortunately, the actual gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Generally units can only attack units in their level on the battlefield, but the top level is the exception. There are fighter bombers that can attack everything and can do a lot of damage, so generally there isn't much reason to build anything else.  Projectiles fired by your units seem to miss more and have shorter range than what your enemy throws at you. I've had instances where I've had several upgraded units destroyed by one lower level enemy unit simply because it flew in slight above the firing arc of my units.  You only have one production queue for everything (building units and upgrading). Furthermore, the enemy can spawn multiple units at a time leaving you scrambling to get even a basic defense set up between upgrading to get the units you need and building stopgap defenses to deal with the enemies swarming you. There really aren't breaks between waves so once you get behind there's a good chance you've already lost the battle. I found myself with huge piles of money and because of the production queue issue I couldn't spend it as fast as I was earning it.  The game is quite short which is fine, but this means that the difficulty ramp is much steeper than it should have been. The later levels are insane with the number of units they throw at you and many times you have to already have built the correct defenses, there's no time to react.  Overall, with a rebalance and some new units (antiaircraft tanks for ground, helicopter gunships and AA ships for mid level for example) this could be an interesting game, but right now I can't really recommend it given the major gameplay issues."
421120,Samorost 3,"This game is absolutely delightful! I've played the previous Samorost games, as well as Machinarium and Botanicula, and this one definitely did not disappoint (though I do wish it had been longer...). Although all the Amanita Design games have amazing soundtracks, Samorost 3 is the first to truly integrate the music and gaming. I'll definitely be buying the amazing soundtrack. Samorost 3 didn't have quite the emotional resonance of Botanicula and Machinarium, but it is definitely worth your time--you'll definitely enjoy this adventure."
421140,Blades of the Righteous,"ILAIDRSINGTRTERIOWAT(I'm lazy and I dislike reading so I'm not going to read this entire review, in other words a TL;DR): It's a good game, which needs a bit more work done with it. Definitely seems like a good deal for the price, especially if you catch it on sale.  For the actual review: The concept of the game is nice. Simplistic and good. The option to stop and continue anytime is great (autosave is included after every turn). The graphics - again, simplistic and nice. The UI is a bit problematic IMO. You often have tooltip windows being blocked by other things, I've seen a typo or two, and in general it's not as responsive as I'd like it to be. Also, fullscreen mode is a no-go until the graphics setting are tweaked for different screen sizes. What would I change? Again, the UI a bit. Make some parts of the game more obvious (like stating that every single action outside the castle spends an entire turn, or that new conscripts arrive every single turn). Maaaaybe add an option to remove existing skills from soldiers. Add a reward indicator to the mode selector in the screen between modes (the one for spending XP on new units and such). Not much more.  So yeah, a good game, needs more work, good deal for the money - especially if you catch it on sale."

42140,Hamilton's Great Adventure,"If you like puzzle games, you'll like this one.  If you hate puzzle games, you'll definitely hate this one.  I was just so happy when I beat the final level.  6.7/10"
42160,War of the Roses,This game is garbage.
421600,Ray Gigant,"Ray Gigant has been a severe disappointment for me. I was excited to play this game but soon found myself more and more bored as time went on. From a completely unlikable main character, pointless party members, to constantly repeated tutorials and unskippable cutscenes there is a lot to dislike.  I pushed on through the repeated dungeons, the simple fights and the uneventful story but I wish I had simply refunded this after my first two hours."
421610,XBlaze Code: Embryo,"If you want a background information on BlazBlue universe, this is a must.  If nothing else, this is a good fun story in on itself, with interesting characters and bonus silly stuff to top it off."
421630,A Study in Steampunk: Choice by Gaslight,"Short version : this is a top-notch adventure book. I felt compelled to go back to try out alternate endings, some of them completely hidden and unexpected even once the general structure of the book starts to be clear (after the 2nd complete playthrough).  Long version : up until now, this is the only book I read in the choice of games batch that approaches the level of Guns of Infinity (even though the Infinity series definitely is superior to Gaslight). The pros are the beautiful setting, the replayability, the well fleshed-out characters, and the social/political scenery (which is rare enough to mention, since most games talk about elves and giants, not about labour law reforms and religious freedoms). The neutral are the writing (decent but not great), the difficulty (can be easy after some playthrough, the difficulty rests in unlocking all achievements). The cons are non."
421660,Harmonia,I loved it!
421670,CUPID - A free to play Visual Novel,"Best free VN on Steam. One of the best VNs on Steam, period. You have absolutely no excuse not to try the game. (best played with headphones after sunset)"
42170,Krater,"Really fun, but the devolopers abandoned it. Beware."
421700,Sakura Santa,"A touching growth story of a socially awkward and depressed young man named Koji. Throughout the game I was thoroughly surprised of how deep the story was, I would even find myself in tears at some points. To be honest I wasn't really ready or expecting the feels trip here, it really brought out the christmas spirit in me and overall succeeded in being the deep romance/drama experience that it aims to. Oh, also butts.  I would rate this game 7 Spicy wolves out of 13 Sneaky foxes, enjoyable experience worth replaying over and over."
421740,Goetia,"Overall, it's a OK+ game, definitely not bad, but certainly not plausible in terms of the game design. It is evident that the creators put decient effort in storytelling, and if you do read everything on notes, you'll find that this is a delicately written, engating story with twisted ending and siganificant indications for humanistic thoughts on warfare and the future of mankind. However, I find that the tasks and puzzles from the midway through started to be far-fetched and some (for sake of not spoiling the story, I won't mention those puzzles) unnecessary. This is particular true somewhere near the end of the story.  There are some shortcomings of the game design not exclusive to this game, but very common to the similiar kinds. E.g. the repetition of characters' lines without updates after the progress of the story. This is usually found in the indication bubble of an object. Say, I found something for the first time in the game, and by clicking on the object, the indication says xxxxx, but after I solved the puzzle, and return to the same object, it says exactly the same line which is no longer relevant to the story at that point, and sometimes, the un-updatableness of indication bubbles caused some confusions to me as I did not understand if I still need it or not.  I started to lose patience till 2/3 of the game as the puzzles were challenging but not in a logical way, and I couldn't go further with the story and got stuck by the puzzles.  However, having said that, with the price I paid during super sale, I'm satisfied with the game, but not excited about it. I do recommend the game as the story is pretty deep if you really try to analyse it as literature, and I understand the creation of a game is far less as easy as writing a review."
421810,OH! RPG!,Its good but good but with a few problems (like oneshot in fights and a not perfect upgradesystem for weapons)
421880,Plastiland,"Basically you have to safetly land ♥♥♥♥ing clay figures. I hate these ♥♥♥♥ing clay figures. If my friend didn't get this for me while it was 80 cents, it would've been a ♥♥♥♥ing rip off. I wasted 7 hours of my life to beat this game for my boii m-a-x. ALso, getting 120 stars made me wanna ♥♥♥♥ing kill myself. Thanks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."
421890,Avaris 2,"Eh, kind of a neutral recommendation. It is nice to watch huge battles but as the game goes on things can get annoying with night maps that have the fog of war which force you to look everywhere for the enemy Comamnder.. I'll also note that I refunded the game.  Gameplay wise, you're an Empress fighting against armies of evil dudes with the help of the King. Your own troops that you buy are the Empress Guardians who follow you around and protect you and can also be ordered around. The hundreds to tens of thousands you get are from the King, a friendly NPC. If either you or the King dies (he can almost always handle himself though) you lose the battle, to win you have to kill the enemy Commander. As Empress you can both fight in melee or use magic as a ranged attack (which is pretty much just Magic Missile). Between battles you can buy upgrades (armor is armor, sword is melee, ring is magic) plus buy extra Guardians.  The game's main appeal of course is the absolutely massive battles. Not all of the levels have these, such as the fog of war levels I mentioned which are annoying. Battles get harder as the game goes on though the position of troops for th battles are randomized. It could definitely use more unit variety (Warrior is generic melee, Ninja moves fast and is weak, Mage is the ranged unit, Mummy is slow but tough) and well more variety overall. As another review pointed out, it is very much grindy and mindless at times (bunch of battles can be won by doing nothing, depending upon the randomization they can end within seconds but that's not too common) plus it's price is a tiny bit steep.  It would definitely make a fun mobile game, but on Steam I'd really only recommend getting it while it's on sale or if you got some dosh to spare from selling ugly CS:GO knife skins. Just be ready to refund if you get too bored."
421900,Shadowrun Chronicles: INFECTED Director's Cut,"I really want to like this game. It has interesting character development, quite fluid and playable combat system, great theme. Sadly, for me its multiplayer system is completely off-putting. Everytime after a run, I go back to the base and my immersion is completely broken by random people running through my char and everywhere around the screen.   If I knew beforehand that this is basically mmo, I would not buy it, as it really destroyes any sense of accomplishment from single player campaign. The game is advertised as indie strategy rpg, as xcom with magic. In fact it is tactical mmorpg. If it were clearly described as mmo, I would recommend it as the gameplay is sound, however as a single player title I cannot do so.  If you want good single player RPG go for one of the Harebrained's titles. Or Witcher, or something, but beware - this certainly is not a single player title."
42200,Nancy Drew Dossier: Resorting to Danger!,"This Nancy Drew game was not like the other games. It was as if they decided to create it for 8 year old girls only. It has almost a constant tutorial and 'sparkle' sound effects. The game did not have the same interactive features as the previous games had. If not comparing it to the other Nancy Drew games, the game is boring in itself."
422020,Dark Days,"Cheap game, all around cheap piece of crap. Voice acting will have you wanting to mute game altogether. Could have been fun but can't get over this feeling that the game should have stayed in oven a little longer. It just feels incomplete. Stuck at a point on securing the first safehouse. Zombies killed - Check, Gates repaired - Check, 2/3 survivors and here lies the problem. You can only move to places you've been, can't move farther because I have searched every where and the 3rd survivor is non existant. Did I miss something? I guess I'll never now, spent as much time as I could before deciding that this was a complete waste of my time and money. The game only tells you that you can't move further. You have no idea of knowing if you've missed something or if that part of game doesn't open till way later in game. Several spots to use sticky bombs yet no idea of when that blueprint will drop. Stay away, you've been warned lol"

42210,Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill,"I want to like this game, but the interface is really annoying and hard to play. Also, all text is blurry on a high resolution screen."
422130,Comic Book Hero: The Greatest Cape,Personally I really injoy this game at first I was confused because there is no guide in the game and it trows you right into everthing but as i begain to play around with the machines of the game I noticed how much customization it has. Yes granted that the maker of the game has games thats have much more extensive customizations in his wrestling games but for what it is and for what year it was made it is great. If you do not like pen and paper games I do not recommend geting this game you will not like it. I will be creating many mods for this game because this game is completely modifiable and I love games that give you that type of freedom especially in a superhero game 
42220,Nancy Drew: The Captive Curse,"For what it is, Nancy Drew: The Captive Curse is an enjoyable game with some difficult puzzles and interesting set pieces. The voice acting and graphics aren’t great, but the game is cheap and cheerful –&nbsp;I look forward to grabbing a few more titles in the future."

422610,1775: Rebellion,"Poorly tested and frustrating to play. Maybe it will be stable later, but certainly not yet."
422630,Metaverse Construction Kit,good for creative minds:)
422640,VR Karts SteamVR,"I'll start by saying that the idea is nice but there is too much holding it down.  First the controls are just garbage. Using the motion controllers as just controllers and hrobile controls at that. Most of the time I cannot turn and drive right off the track. Had to drop the motion controllers and pick up a normal one just to drive correctly.  Next the AI are impractical. I've intentionally saved a full boost and used it right after an AI just used there boost and they were still right behind me. And this will also be the same AI that used its boost everytime it picked it up so I know it wasn't also full on boost.  The next fustrating thing, and one of my big pet peeve of this game and when the AI hits you from behind, logic would say that you will get a small push but instead, you slow down, and the AI get a small boost and passes you. What is the reason for the mirrors, if blocking someone only works against you.  The game has potential but it still needs more work."
422650,Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age,"The presentation isn't amazing, and it definitely isn't enough to save the game from its huge gameplay flaws.  You deal so little damage with your basic attack that you run out of mana trying to kill anything. Then, you have to wait for your horrible mana regen to kick in. You spend a disproportionate amount of time waiting for your mana regen as you watch your summons slowly auto attack enemies to death. Its a shame that casting spells in a game about casting spells is so incredibly weak."
422860,Holodance, Early Access Review
422900,Particle Fleet: Emergence,"tl;dr: Novel content that you absolutely need to try.  It's basically your childhood dream in game form: Dynamic ships with volumetric, fully destructible hull which is simulated per-piece, no immersion-breaking health bars, only that giant hole in your ship which went straight through your lathe module. The enemy, despite being a mass of particles, is surprisingly relatable and seemingly intelligent (in the sense that you will rage at it because it destroyed your HQ while you were trying to hold it off elsewhere, or it managed to take out that mission-critical energy mine). There's also enemy ships with a rudimentry AI, but even those can be devasting opponents. Storyline is excellent and has ties with previous creeper world games, but you don't need those to enjoy this game.  The game also includes a full ship editor, where you can build out your hull block-by-block then litter it with guns, energy tanks and support modules. There's also an in-depth mission editor with a fully-scriptable 'PRPL' module for creating complex custom maps with original behavior. If you're not one for building a map, there's a mission generator capable of making just about anything you want, and they play like an actual story mode mission, with a (normally) balanced progression, minus a few novelties usually present in most custom maps.   Combat is surprisingly in-depth: Ramming with heavily armored ships works just as well as missile spam, and the hull+modules-to-build-time ratio really helps balance it as well. There's not a huge variety in weapons, but the ways in which you can combine those weapons lead to specialized ships and rich strategies. You can design a huge mothership with twenty of each module, but you need to defend it for a considerable amount of time due to the steadily increasing time-per-hull-cost ratio. Or you can go the route of several smaller ships, or even several ships which combine into a larger ship.  The game isn't bad in terms of performance either: obviously, a massive particle simulation isn't exactly easy for your CPU but it runs fine on my mid-range gaming laptop. Graphics look great, although they're not as impressive as say, GSB2.  All I can say is that this would be EPIC as a game engine for realtime player vs player ship combat. There's already fully-featured enemy ships controllable via scripting, but what could beat real multiplayer where you have to build your fleet up, organize your particulate and proceed to the all-out in a war of epic proportions.  My only complain is that it would be nice if tankers would refuel ships within range of an energy mine if the mine was unable to provide them sufficient power.  protip: Omnis (especially with the cannon and reactor upgrade) work great as both area denial/defense, stealth missions and cannon fodder."
422910,Creeper World Anniversary Edition,"This is the best Creeper World game ever made. It is worth it at any price, but especially worth it now if you buy it during the Steam Winter Sale as you can get it the Anniversary Edition discount price or as part of the KnuckleCracker bundle. It has nothing in common with CW2, but if you've played CW3 you will recognize all the units instantly. You can get through the campaign in a long weekend; it has 20 maps. However, where this game shines is the replayability function-- every single day-- every single day has a new map. And you can go back and play old maps regardless of when you buy it, so if you want to play the map for July 4th, 1976, that's in here somewhere. And you post your best time online to compare/compete with the best times of others.   Gameplay: For those who has never played Creeper World, it's basically a Tower Offense game. In every map you have a base called Odin City, and you have to build outward from there. Instead of random monsters, the bad guy is watery, ocean-like 'Creeper' that keeps rising; you have mortars and drones to beat it back. However, they cost energy and so you will also spend a great deal of time building energy farms and reactors, all of which always have to connect back to Odin City.  The game is fun, exciting, and highly addictive. Plus it's got a new visual upgrade for Steam so it looks far nicer than the original version. Well worth getting!"
422920,Creeper World 2 Anniversary Edition,"As a big fan of TDF games I can highly recommend the Creeper series! It is a very original concept that works really very well Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is still my all-time favorite TDF It has a very high repeatability and an active community I played all the creeper games for many hours for free online, and I hoped the series would be available on Steam These are Gems worth buying!"
422970,Devil Daggers,"Please add controller support. As a tv/couch player, keyboard &amp; mouse isn't an option and this game is not suitable for steam controllers."
422980,Super Robot Jump Jump,"This hard as nails platformer will have your palms sweating in no time. The controls are really tight; if you miss a jump it's your own fault, or should I say Jump Jump. Love the driving music in the volcano levels. Definitely recommended."
4230,Race: The WTCC Game,"Don't buy this if your after realism. Sliding 50 meters sideways while only doing 15kmph is impossible and if you were going fast enough to slide that far you would flip and roll, because it is on bitumen.  Having said that, if your after some quick race fun that is relatively cheap, especially if you can get it in a bundle, go for it!"
423180,A.I. Space Corps,How AI Invasion could be a pretty decent shooter end-up making such a bad game is beyond me. :(
423220,T-Kara Puzzles,"  T-Kara Puzzles should be served with first morning coffee :) T-Kara Puzzles is the thing for start of a good day.  Good variety of puzzle mods, relaxing ambiente and music, decent price is all I need to recommend this game to anyone."
423230,Furi,It's amazing how many people confuse tedium for difficulty
423270,ZHEROS,"Graphically, it's a nice looking game, fairly over the top designs for the heroes and robots. Unlike most games of this genre it isn't just going from left to right, there is a 3D element in play too as you can be heading up or down along a path as well, so it isn't quite linear, which opens the door for the a bit of exploring if it appears there are two paths you can take.The HUD is perfect in its simplicity, top par is your health, bottom bar is your energy (which is tied to the player's ability to block or fire a weaspon)  The controls are easy to learn, which is a huge plus, as some games tend to over-think the controlscheme a bit, though Zheros does have some control elements I don't like (the hold a button to charge an attack gimmick is something I truly hate, no matter the game). Playing normal difficulty, there is a nice even flow, where you have to learn and master all the basics, as knowing when to dodge and block can often be a determining factor being victory and defeat, by the end of the 3rd stage, a player should have all the basics down solid (at least in theory)  The music is where this game shines, I was just bopping along to the sound track, it's that infectious! The sound effects are of a decent quality, the robots have little sounds they make when getting smack around which is a nice touch.  VERDICT Though Zheros has very mixed reviews on Steam, I find it enjoyable for what it is, and since decent beat 'em games are not as easy to come by these days, I give this game my approval, and recommend you give it a shot!  Review can also befound on my blog at  www.fredcasdensbasement.com "
423320,Pendragon Rising,Great game has his own style 10/10
423440,Choice of Kung Fu,"This is one of my favourite games of 'Choice of...' series. It doesn't feel neither too long nor too short, provides quite a lot of options to choose from and various endings. Besides the theme of Chinese martial arts seems enticing to me. If you like Choose Your Own Adventure type of games, you should definitely give it a try - you will be rewarded."
423490,Air Missions: HIND, Early Access Review
423580,Project Highrise,"Simple UI, simple yet entertaining gameplay, and workshop support; pretty fun."
423590,The Little Acre,"Played through the game and have to say it's quite good. However, as others have noted, it's quite 'rough at the edges' for some parts. Fair warning, there might be small spoilers ahead!  Since I grew up with Daedalic games I've seen quite some different drawing styles. However, Daedalic always pays attention to wrap it all up - No matter if the style is hand drawn and scanned, drawn on a tablet or rendered: It looks like a package where everything fits together. With this game there are several different styles from scribbles (the cat for example) to the fully fleshed out style of Clonfira but nothing to really piece it together. Playing especially the Non-Clonfira passages felt rough as that's in my opinion the places where most styles clash together. This is definitely a point which needs some work.  Also, the storytelling is rather quick and due to this often feels jumpy and disjointed. Sometimes, it's neccessary to take the time and explain things whole to make sure everyone has time to realize the gravity of the situation. A good example of this is the first meeting with Nina and their conversation: It feels very staged as there is no time for shock or other emotions (directly answers with 'oh my god, no! Let's go!' for example - She might be quick thinking but that one just felt unnatural). Also that tombstone. Certain someone just walkes through a weird new world and encounters a stone with a name on it. Why does she exactly know what happened there? No one explained it. There's not even a rest in piece inscription. Throughout the game there were several of those small hiccups where I just felt 'thrown out of the story'. The next game should definitely make sure people are sticking to the story 'til the end.  The voiceacting was all around pretty awsome, there's not much to criticize here - Everyone was in character and emotions are shown accordingly. However, some samples were a little louder or quieter than the general others. It makes sense if the character is visibly muffled to tone down the voice but looking at two things, in the same room, without much difference in distance should give the same volume.  Character design and world building was all around great. No complains at all here. :)  So overall? This game is very charming and is a lot of fun to play through. It is rough yes, but I'm positive that the developers can take the lessons learned with this game and push for a great game in the future. I'm looking forward to that! Definitely recommending this game to everyone who loves point and click adventures."

423770,Our Love Will Grow,"Our Love Will Grow is a fun little Harvest Moon clone that will have you growing crops, buying farm animals, training your dog, marrying a townsgirl, and eventually having a kid. It's a very minimalistic game, with the time limit being mostly negligible and without there being any seasons in the game. Despite this, it still remains fun. It's nice upgrading your tools and unlocking new crop seeds you can buy. There is a good bit to explore and you progress through the caves as you get better tools.  The music is pleasant enough to last you through the game, and while the artwork is weird and ugly, the in-game graphics are simple and pleasant as well. The characters are very immature, childish even, where sometimes they will act like you would expect, but then others they will act like a 7 year old and say something outrageous. It's kind of off-putting when even the girl you end up marrying starts acting like a spoiled brat. You usually run out of stamina much sooner than the day ends, so you'll find yourself going to bed around 12 in the afternoon not too long into the game. The gameplay gets a bit stale and becomes a repeditive task after a while...yet...for some reason the game draws you in and makes you want to see it all the way through. I have almost a full day of playtime put into this game, and if you enjoy games that you shouldn't take too seriously and have a weird unintended sense of humor, you might end up enjoying this one. I did, and recommend it to anyone with an open mind, especially for how cheap you can get it."
423800,Automata Empire,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!  There's literally nothing to this game. It's just ♥♥♥♥ing dots moving around. There's ZERO strategy to it, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing dots moving around doing whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want."

423870,Astervoid 2000,"The single player mode is really challenging, which is great because you can have a really quick session and don't have to coast through waves of too easy enemies. The controls are fantastic, responsive, and easy to learn. The game really shines in the couch multiplayer mode. Matches last a few minutes and are really intense. Music is great too.  It's a very polished game and exactly what it says it is and needs to be. It's a great next step in the evolution of games like Asteroids and Spacewar!"
423880,Carpe Diem,"This game was fun and as for the story, good story and really touching somehow... but anyways had fun reading and somehow playing it. :D"
423900,Dinocide,"Could have been a decent old-school platformer if the developer in his infinite wisdom didnt decide to reinvent the wheel and make it square. The added hunger meter is like a fly in an otherwise good soup, it ruins everything. Doing everything under a constant time limit is probably the design choice i dislike the most in any videogame."

424060,The Glow,"Although the atmosphere and the gameplay are incerdibly interesting, this game is bugged like a rotting corpse. The unlockables don't unlock and the game disables it's HUD every couple of events. Too bad, just a little more attention paid to it and it could be a hit."
424100,Celestrion,"I'd love to recommend this game, but it is too difficult for me. Saturn (my main) is really hard to play, and has poor frame data and movement speed. If they buffed saturn, I might give this another go.  Pros-  -Fast, exciting gameplay -epic music 3. Lots of cool things to do; replayability  Cons- -Jupider is OP -No controller support -Hard to learn -No techs"
424170,The fall of gods,"After such a long time playing this game and trying to get into it, I think I've finally given up. Visually, it's pretty impressive for an RPG Maker game - at least I think it's RPG Maker since those resources (artwork and audio) come from RPG Maker XP. But the game just feels so very tedious, even for an open world kind of game, and there's no real rhyme or reason to anything you need to do or accomplish.  The combat felt okay at best, although the hit detection seemed off at times. It was also easy to fall into a pond or lake and then get stuck. In most cases, you fall into a pond or lake you'd lose some health and respawn on the land where you dropped in. But quite often the game would not remember where to respawn you at, and instead just keep respawning you right back in the pond or lake you fell into, and you're helpless to do anything but either reset the game or watch as your health slowly depletes away.  Constantly having to navigate back and forth across a large landmass without any means of fast travel was another time waster for me. NPC's dropped meaningless clues or would send you on a large fetch quest that often times had you going back and forth across various regions far too often to be any sort of fun.  The biggest challenge in the game is trying to locate all the correct cracks in the floor and walls that will actually do anything of value. You spend so much time straining your eyes for any sort of cracks in the earth you can hit with a pitchfork. And then you get an explosion spell that can open up entrances in the walls. Except half the time one crack in the wall that will reveal an entry way looks no different than the cracks in the walls that do not lead anywhere, and you spend so much time wasting spell power trying to blow everything up, only to then have to leave the dungeon or cave or whatever to recharge your MP.  Some might find it fun to spend aimless hours on a game like this, and that's fine. Maybe this is what all the hype surrounding open world games is all about. If it is, it's not for me.  If you're looking for something a bit more streamlined, and perhaps a bit more story and character driven, you might want to find a different game to play."
424210,SodaCity,"I've been playing this game since the alpha and the beta, its simply awesome and really really entertaining, you could play for hours! The difficulty is an important fact to the game, it remembered me the jewels of nintendo or super nintendo. Give it a try, you'll enjoy it for sure!"

NEUTRAL: - Gets repetetive  OVERALL: This game is overall a good experience. 9/10  Edit: Developers added some g4y achievements that i don't want to try to get. This is why this game is getting thumbs down."
424320,Anomaly 1729,I really would like to recommend this game. The visuals are amazing for an indie game at this price and I think with a little more polish it could be a really great Portal clone. Too many bugs spoiled it for me though. With a game where you need to be this precise to solve puzzles I would hope theyd do an extra thorough job of bug fixing it.
424370,Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem, Early Access Review
424590,Farm Expert 2017,"Edited update: Unfortunately to the 17 people who have found my review helpful so far, after playing the game after the tutorial I have ran into some things that force my hand to no longer be able to recommend the game in its current state:  Gameplay is smooth, however this game is no where near a finished state. Many features and text are missing, for instance trying to sell your crops at the silos bring up empty text boxes and the game does not tell you how much you are selling for. You also would in theory have to drive to the different silos to just see what the prices were, if it even told you. 2 hours of gameplay was on the tutorial, the rest of the 4 is on growing a crop, selling it, and experiencing these things. Furthermore, textures and lighting is poorly done, and flickering can be seen commonly; to skip say, 100 days for your crops to mature, you have to go to the calendar, go to the last day of the month, then skip a day, then repeat for the next 2 months. There is also missing text at the place where you store your grain, you don't own a combine from the start (you are forced to take a loan or hire help), meaning before you even start the game you're at a disadvantage, and the wear and tear of your vehicle doesn't really mean that much. For instance, I ran my vehicles for an entire planting, fertilizing, and harvesting season, and ran into many things due to clunky controls, but I barely damaged the tractor.   The game should be advertised as a early access as the game is not yet finished. You cannot tell this within the two hour time frame that the refund term gives.  Original review: Just finished the tutorial scenarios and have a decent idea about the game. Positives: The game plays pretty decently. I have it on the max settings and it doesn't go under 60 fps. Furthermore, the asthetic of the game is just that, an asthetic. They weren't trying to make it look realistic or anything. The controls are fine, and from what all you can do (buy and upgrade buildings, plant and havest other kinds of fruits like berries other tree fruits, ensure that your machines are taken care of, etc etc.)   Neutrals: The soil physics are iffy. They look alright, and they are a fun feature that isn't present in other games, but they kind of get in the way sometimes. Should the wheel of the plow make a 4 foot deep hole? probably not. But it isn't the end of the world.  Negatives: Minor bugs. Some of the textures are popping through others (can see small patches of grass through fields, streets etc. Nothing to write home about (but enough to write in here!)) Also it seems like some of the machines were rushed. The last tutorial was of the beets, and the beet harvestor looks like ♥♥♥♥. The treads on the front of it doesn't look finished at all. The bumpy roads. Bad? Sure, but again, its not a game breaking bug. And finally, apparently you cannot switch between tutorials without fully exiting the game, or at least I couldnt figure out how. Again, this is easily overlooked, as its only 2 hours of the game.  But in the end, there isn't anything better or worse than FS15, and I believe it will be better than FS17, as it seems like they've just added a few new toppings on an already aging game engine. The devs will need to patch some stuff, and there is mod support. For $15 less that what FS17 will be, its a worthy contender even with its flaws. As I play the game more, if I find issues that cant be ignored, I'll update my review. The game's tutorials took me 2.1 hours to finish, so I could refund it if I wanted, but I probably wont. I believe after a few updates, it'll be a fantastic game."

424830,Bell Ringer,"  Frankly this game is utter trash. But I got it for free and played it with a friend. The controls are so horrible. The gameplay is so unbalanced. But that's what made us laugh. In the end, isn't that all that matters?  ...no. It's not. It's still a trash game and I have no clue how we had so much fun.  Only buy if you are expecting the game to be like a week old turd in a bungalow"

This team is in the world of the 2016 Ghostbusters, not in the Original 1984, every reference is on the new one. Nothing special. Save your money or wait for the sales or buy 'Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime'."
425340,Space Moth DX,"I wasn't high when playing this, but I honestly think this is what it feels like."
425410,Road to Ballhalla,"  This is like one of those puzzlers I used to play in the school computer labs, but done better! Its beautiful simple fun, with all the speedrunning creativity to expect from this publisher!   https://megabadger24.wordpress.com/2017/01/03/my-top-ten-best-games-of-2016-10-6/ "
425580,The Room Two,That's probably not a game you'd wanna buy. It's kinda boring and annoying. First part was better.
425670,Seraph,"I really wanted to like this game, but it just falls apart in the end hard. The combat starts off kind of fun but then becomes tedious because as the scaling difficutly ramps up, every enemy becomes a bullet sponge and does a heck of a lot of damage. The game stays tuff until the last boss, where even on the 'normal' difficulty you die in 3 hits or so. Whats worse, you have no way to scale the difficutly back, so basically if you did really good through most of the game then get to the last boss that is a HECK of a lot harder then anything else you have fought, you can either quit and start over or bang your head against a wall trying to get past him. For a game that took about 3 hours to go to the end, spending more then 30 minutes fighting the same boss over and over isnt fun. Ive always like the ninja gaiden design to boss battles, if they can kill you super fast, you can kill them super fast too, but the whole fight is challenging. Hate to say it, but avoid this game."
425720,Cloudlands : VR Minigolf,"I really wanted to like this game, but just kept on getting tangled in my cables like no other game I've played in VR, which was very distracting, and made it hard for me to continue playing and enjoying it. If you have a larger room space to play in you might not have this issue, but with 1.5x2.5m, found it wasn't quite working well for me overall."
425820,Dragonpath,dont buy this game its dreadful. i have played flash games with more depth than this. the controls are really bad and the gameplay is awful.
425860,Vector Assault,"I'll be quick (which, for me, is a rarity). This is a perfectly fine game - competently designed, handles smoothly, controls like a twin-stick shooter should. It just feels slightly unambitious, or like Wizbyte got it as far as 'solidly functioning' and chose not to go any further. Balance problems pop up early, with a bit of a 'hurry up and wait' flow to the game. The fact that the main enemies have strict pursuit AI means that the game does not demand the chaotic hand independence of, say, Robotron 2084. There are a few instances of lacking in polish, too - I run the game in a downscaled resolution, and the bomb count and score multiplier are on top of each other, so I have no idea what my value for either is.  If you cannot get enough twin-stick shooters, or if you've never played one, you probably won't regret buying this, but it's hard to recommend when, even in my limited experience, I've played a few others that better capture the essence of this style of game."
425870,Gyrodisc Super League,   Early Access Review
426000,HunieCam Studio,"If you expected Hunie Hop 2, stay away of this. No gallery of exciting pics here. Absolutely none. This is a resource management game, highly addictive. You exploid your girls for money, which isn't so polite as to get a date with them. The game itself is an addictive resource management but, since rewards are just to buy some robe or hairstyle for your girls , what makes no effect in the game, since no girl is seen during the gameplay, or to get the achivements, it lacks interest very soon. Devs, when will you release a meaty Hunie Hop 2, more girls, more pics, more explicit? when? when?"
426010,Womb Room,The meme isn't even worth it on Black Friday. God damn it.
426040,Goodnight Butcher,game is fun at the beginning but it just gets boring caues you have to do the samething over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and its not really a scary game. 5/10
426170,Defragmented,It just took me 3 days to complete the story. I hope they will add more content soon enough and will let orange items drop from mobs from time to time.
426240,Caretaker Sacrifice,   Early Access Review
426290,The Away Team,"An interesting enough story, but not as interactive as I was hoping. Don't be fooled by the screencaps, you will be spending 99% of your time reading neon green letters. Comfortable chair highly recommended."
426330,MetaHuman Inc.,"MetaHuman Inc. is satisfyingly long and has a more complex, detailed plot than average for a Choice of Games product. I had thought it was one of my favorites until replaying it after spending time in other CYOA games this week. I found myself more critical afterwards. The supporting cast are rather bland and making divergent choices didn't effect the plot as much as I would have liked. I do like the resource allocation elements to the game and feel like it helped me feel invested in the success of the company itself and added to the sense that I was indeed the CEO and responsible for success and/or failure of my company.   But I found myself unimpressed with the setting itself. Choice of Deathless, Choice of Robots, Midsummer Night's Choice and Tin Star are examples of CoG products with a satisfying and immersive setting, whereas MetaHuman's ended up feeling very flat. Nevertheless, I'm giving it a recommendation because I feel its positive features outweigh its flaws."
426560,Full Tilt Poker,"Play money poker. If you pay money for play money poker, you are bad at poker, deserve to feel bad after playing this game, and shouldn't leave a bad review."
426590,Blood of Magic, Early Access Review
426610,Virtually Live presents Formula E Season Two Highlights,"Needs alot of impovement, Graphics are bad and cars go through corners at lightning speeds with incredible grip haha. Nice try though."
426630,Bubsy Two-Fur,"Pros: Catchy Music,Decent Art Design, 2 for the price of 1, You don't have to play it,Bubsy is dead,Youtubers get good revenue of this,Steam ain't goin' bankrupt because of it. Cons: Annoying puns,Annoying Main Character,Fall Damage,Sonic Wanna-be,Terrible controls, Bubsy runs like sonic in mario like levels, Camera is too slow and constriting,Spawned the one of the worst pieces of animation ever, Spawned on of the worst games ever must i go on?(I could say Everything, but i want to go into more detail.)"
426690,Narcissu 10th Anniversary Anthology Project,"Don't buy now, go read 1 and 2 while you wait for the DLCs."
42670,Singularity,"I expected this game to be like Fallout, but all it did was give me a headache. The story is dull, and there isn't much to do besides kill aliens. It's a crappy attempt to be like Borderlands. I recommend buying Borderlands 2 with the refund $ from this game."
426790,Grow Up,"I have only played this for about a half hour, but so far this game is awesome. I played the first one for about 8 hours on my old laptop that could barley run it, but i loved it. Now my pc has evolved and this game runs awesome on it. This is one of those games that you shouldn't pass by."
42680,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,Crap load of hackers!!!
42690,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - Multiplayer,"Whee okay. I'll keep it simple, like the game is. Pros: Still fast paced Can still be somewhat fun once you get to a higher level Spec Ops is fun for 4 hours maybe more if you have friends who play Cons: Worst maps in a FPS ever Weapon leveling is stupid Guns are badly badly badly balanced Community now consists of players going prone the moment they see someone Killstreaks are no longer kill streaks, you now get kills streaks for total kills - wat."
426930,Moonshot, Early Access Review
42700,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"I will talk about the campaign, because everyone already knows what the multiplayer is like.  It's your typical COD game. If you forget all of the problems that this franchise has, than this is a half decent game. The story is interesting, and it's misteryous enough to make you wonder what is actually happening. Unfortunetly the game wasn't as epic as the previous ones. I didn't get all hyped up, and got that adrenalin rush that is usually present when playing a COD game. So I wouldn't recomment it if that's your thing.   TL;DR : The campaign is not that bad, it's a good experience. I bought it for only 8 dollars in my local store, but I don't think I would buy this game for 40 dollars. It's way too expensive. Altough I would recommend buying it on a sale."
427030,Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Gate of Firmament,"If you intend to play this game, you might wanna set a slow text speed (if that's even possible). Since the audio is in chinese and the subtitles in english, the pacing can be a tad annoying if your not a fast reader. The sometimes screwed up grammar doesn't really help either.  Aside from the screenshots/intro sequence which do look fairly good, the rest of what i've seen looks fairly bland, like a standard korean f2p mmo with some thrown in cutscenes.  Lastly, while the xbox controller works just fine, all the prompts ingame are shown for keyboard ...  i gave up trying to figuring out which buttons did what, simply mashing buttons is plenty to win the fights even on hard. "
427040,Pitstop Challenge,"  What is in the description, it's all in the game.  Nothing less, nothing more.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFytkBdjyC8   "
427100,Fernbus Simulator,"The game looks good, but there are too many bugs which spoil the gameplay. AI vehicles spawning on the road in front of you. AI vehicles stopping in queues for no reason, suddenly being off road despite being on the road, AI vehicles too slow to pull away from lights being just a few of them."
427190,Dead Rising,"Digital homicide games had better shooting mechanics than this ♥♥♥♥.  Seriously, how can any game have bad shooting controls in a world where we have had doom for over two decades. Add to that the fact that the enemies who use guns are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aimbots.  Then theres the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, hitboxes, and script.   I don't even know why I bought this, hated it on xbox too"
427240,Cosmic Trip, Early Access Review
427250,8-Bit Armies,"This game was a definite interest to me as a old C@C player, but the simplicity of this game isn't neccesarily a good thing. Anyone can learn a more complex strategy game if they simply put in the time. Multiplayer is a fun and tense experience, if you find any matches. If you enjoy playing against AI, like me, then you'll more than likely be dissapointed.  I feel like the AI is very shallow and thoughtless. Hard AI whips up a base and has enemies on you before you as a human player can so much as build your first turret or have your vehicles out. Its more about overwhelming numbers for the AI, whilst building the most scatter-brained base defenses. If you try some smart tactics like sneak in from the back, most often you'll see the ai units aimlessly standing around. They'll only move to defend their base if you get too close. AI, like with all C&amp;C games, will almost always take the same generic path through a map. This allows countering even Insane level AI by setting up a heavy defence at their expected route.  One of the skirmishes i played was assasinate. The AI superunits simply acted as glorified infantry taking on an assault on its own. With its underpowered rifle, it would only makes sense they'd try to keep it safe, not the first line of defense. Needless to say, i wiped the AI without ever seeing their base, and to top it off, an ally of mine decides to nuke the area of a recently defeated AI base.  Really I want to love this game but the single player aspect is all i really care for, and the AI is just not smart. If the AI gets some improvements, this would be a much better game for offline play. I would love to see AI behaviors, such as turtles or steamrollers found in C&amp;C Generals. A emphasis on exploiting player weaknesses or openings aside from brute unit steamrolling would make offline play much better.  If you don't get the game, i would definetely recommend the soundtracks. Frank Klepacki has made an astonishingly beautiful set of tracks for this game, as he has for all of the original Westwood developed C&amp;C titles."
427270,Orcs Must Die! Unchained,"Streessful game, you need to do massive multitasking or lose, ridiculous upgrade 1.6  Edit: good coop if you have luck"
427470,Democracy 3 Africa,"'This game has taught me that if you want to be a dictator, you don't make it so that no one can vote; you make it so that everyone has to vote and your policies cater to most people.' - Biggus Dickus President of Mauritius for 204 years 6 months 3 days 11 hours and 27 minutes."
427480,FritzChess 15,I paid on the nose for this chess program with great expectations only to be let down. The chess engine is great as you would expect but the GUI is buggy at best; it constantly stalls and flickers; it is definitely not worth the money they ask for it. The overall feel of this program is that it is still in the Beta stage of development (after 15 versions?) They do not offer a 64bit download! I circumvented this problem by downloading a pirate copy and entering my product key from steam to make it a legal copy. Now I can run both 32 and 64 bit versions on my computer.
427510,Way of the Samurai 3,"While a little old and quirky Way of the Samurai 3 is an incredibly fun underrated title. It's possibly my favorite game of all time and has a kind of open ended gameplay and storyline that I adore. I've already played ten hours in just two nights and I can see my self logging many more. It has the same charm and allure of Majora's Maks in terms of characters and locations, and a solid soundtrack.   At $15 you can hardly lose, try it out!"
427520,Factorio, Early Access Review
427550,Tibetan Quest: Beyond the World's End,"This was definitely a silly one as is obvious from previous reviews. I think I lost it at the point where you need to pour gas from a canister to a gas cylinder beside a gas stove (LOL). Still, I played it to the end, but a bug in the last HO scene (could not pick an object, and I clicked everywhere in a fairly large area around it) prevented me from getting the no hints achievement (had to switch to mahjong to bypass that one). Cannot really recommend this one, although in this case, I'd prefer a third option besides Yes and No, and that would be Meh."
427570,Dawn of Andromeda, Early Access Review
427660,NightCry,"This game is just for the mobile, not pc.  Really bad graphic, texture, control... The only positive thing is the storyline."
427730,Who's Your Daddy?!,so much lag!!! plz fix it.
427760,A Chair in a Room: Greenwater,"Game doesn't work for me, I get to the boat part and there is no trigger to move to the next area. I'm literally stuck on a boat. Looked up the solution, still doesn't work for me. Tried 5 times (have to sit through a 5 minute boring ♥♥♥ boat ride each time) and it never worked. Game seems interesting but the bugs just prevent me from actually playing it. REFUNDED!"
427770,Pills4Skills,I can see sounds now
427780,PERFECT ANGLE: The puzzle game based on optical illusions,i loved it  it was interesting and addicting
427810,CALENDULA,"While I appreciate these types of games, this one really wouldn't be worth more than $1. It takes less than an hour to beat and, to me, didn't truely offer any better meta experience than other games could (such as Stanley Parable). The imagery felt cliche and although the 'ending' may or may not come as a surprise to some people, to me it was fairly obvious half way through.   This would have made a decent freebie browser based experience, but for me it came and went quickly, left no lasting impressions, and just wasn't worth the already discounted price.  I would have loved to see them take the concepts in this game and incorporate them into something larger and more subtle."
427820,Hitman GO: Definitive Edition,"This puzzle game has a neat idea but mediocre execution. There are some generally clever moments in this game but unfortunatly they are too few and far between. If you are a die-hard lover of puzzlers then it might be worth picking up for ultra-cheap during one of the sales but the simplicity of the levels will most likely disappoint. This would probably be a decent casual mobile game but as a PC port it just doesn't deliver.  Pros - Artwork is good and the boardgame aesthetic is a nice touch - Of the 91 levels, there are a dozen or so that are generally clever - Some of the later game pieces are well thought out and allow for some good level design - The game doesn't hand hold with tutorials or 'how-tos' but the introduction of new pieces is well-paced enough not to overwhelm  Cons - Clearly designed for mobile and the port is mediocre for PC. There is no keyboard support and movement is based on mouse drags (which is less precise than using a finger on a mobile device and quickly becomes an annoyance) - Interface is wonky and is begging for a turn counter as half of the objectives in the game are based on turn count. You have to count turns yourself to figure out if you are going to meet your objective - Levels are far too easy and the entire game can be beaten in a matter of a day. Additional objectives are added to increase difficulty (occasionally to effect) but most of the time they are just mutual exclusive goals forcing you to play a simple level twice in order to get a full completion - There are several obvious bugs in the game: including some poor camera angles, the level map showing your character piece on the wrong level and as others have stated as of December 2016 multiple Steam achievements are broken (so you will never be able to get 100% completion)."
427860,The Next World,This is a terrific casual game that tells a great story and demands just enough time and attention to keep it fun and challenging. Just like the three bears: not too hard but not too easy either but just right. The only thing I didn't care for was the casual homosexual reference. Note to developer: we play games to escape the tedium of real life... Go peddle your social agenda elsewhere eh? Just stick to entertainment and leave the vocal 10% to their own...
427890,Felt Tip Circus,A few minigames that weren't really much fun. Hardly worth the price being asked.
427910,Zavix Tower,"Great simplistic dungeon crawler!  The strategy is straightforward, the story is fairly minimal which is a plus for me, and from what i've experienced thus far, boss fights are tough but not impossible! Well-designed and level scaling is smooth. Only thing I wish I could see more of was a variety of monsters, but otherwise I recommend trying this game if you like the old-school RPG-type games."
427930,Army of Tentacles: (Not) A Cthulhu Dating Sim,this game is crap
427950,The Withering, Early Access Review
427980,Aozora Meikyuu,"Well.. There were so many opportunities to fill the game with more story and make it longer. However, looks like developer had missed it. Overall it is a quite good story. Some parts are a little bit repetitive, but it's ok. Enjoyed it. Recommend to buy it on sale or in bundles."
428020,The ORPHEUS Ruse,"Many of the stats don't actually affect most of the game, the only reason to change which body you are in is in order to learn a short backstory of them used in the ending. There is no major difference in outcome regardless of your choices and most of your choices are meaningless."
42810,For The Glory,i dont seem to get the hang of it. inflation is a ♥♥♥♥♥ even though i had help from another player. will play to the end and delete. I think unless you are a fan of Iniversalis games then maybe this is not for you. Then again. If you dont try you will not know. Still played hours on this. cheated to many times. Save ..play another nation. make war with my old nation. Wipe out the troops with delete. Save. Go back to old nation. Attack....i win....lol
428100,Beyond Reality,"Now this is a game I can easy recommend for every fan of JRPG's. A good story and a neat, if somewhat short game.  Don't let the minimalistic graphics fool you. Behind that is an old school JRPG."
428110,Save Halloween: City of Witches,"[Updated]  I had to change my review to not recommended, at least until the massive lag bug gets fixed. Multiple people have posted to the discussion board about the issue, but that appears to not be read. Quite seriously, I had a lag in game that started with three goal matches left, and the last match took over five minutes to resolve which should have taken probably ten seconds.   Unbearable!  --------------------------------------------------------  [Previously]  This is one of the best match 3 games I have played - power ups, achievements, Halloween, hidden object, and achievable 3 stars. It's the standard fare for matching, and so far, there's been a few new mechanics. Mostly the same, though, which is not a bad thing. It's that layer of comfort.  However, the devs need to get off their pumpkins and start responding in the forums! There are some bugs that prevent this from being top notch and an automatic purchase for match 3 players. Number one for me is always community support. Not perfection, just community support.  Still, I would recommend it for anyone that loves Halloween match 3 games as there really aren't that many of them."
428180,Islet Online, Early Access Review
428190,MadOut Open City,Its just reminds me of one of then old Playstation 2 games you find on Steam and think oh il buy that for the memories even though the game does not look the best nowadays. This is that just without the memories lol. Might be alright in the future with updates but at the moment i found it very boring after like 30 mins.
428200,Attack Heroes, Early Access Review
428210,Horror in the Asylum,Boring game repetitive
428220,TurnOn,"Judging from the acheivements I earned I'm about half way done with the game. I was going to wait until I completed the whole game, but I can't. I got stuck on a runner level and was getting sick of it (seriously, I was about to just quite the game for good for how much I loath this pointless level) until I finally did beat it (and was overjoyed for about two seconds)... until my alien zoomed straight past the score board for that level and and the game proceeded to basically bug out and get stuck. The animaltion of rain and the music was still going, so it wasn't frozen, it just failed to animate the scoreboard after I went past it. I hate that level so much, beating it once should have been enough (it didn't count me beatingthe level becaue I had to quit out of the stuck scene). So I think I'm done with this game. I want my money back, honestly. Nearly 3 hours wasted on this."
428230,Swift,love playing this game with friends but is there any global multiplayer servers?
428250,Mystery Castle: The Mirror's Secret,"If I could give this a middling review I would. It wasn’t all bad. I thought the art and the designs were really nice. The voice acting is very nice. And the game starts out well it is pretty fast paced and not a lot of mucking about and fun puzzles. But as the game goes on the puzzles get more obtuse and silly. Culminating in a puzzle that is match these foods with these colors. Which is pretty original and a neat idea for a puzzle except the execution of the puzzle is terrible. An apple in real life can be a few different colors. In the game what looks like blue berries turn out to be black berries. Some seed like things turn out to be blue? What? So, I have to give serious minus points for that sadly."
428260,The Book of Desires,"This one is a shame, because I sometimes enjoy HOG's and this one was decent...up until one puzzle which was basically broken, and I could proceed no further. As a developer myself. little raises my ire as much as completely broken stuff (that would be obvious to spot during testing) that never gets fixed. A reluctant thumbs-down on this one."
428270,Twilight City: Love as a Cure,I enjoyed this game. The storyline was pretty weak but it was good to find a game I where I could have my own avatar and work my way up in this gothic vampire setting. I wish there were more games like it.
428280,Mystery of Unicorn Castle: The Beastmaster,"Not a bad game, not a good game, somewhere in between. It's a nice twist in the story, but not very believable. Not everything makes sence. The puzzles are nice though. I was glad the game was over, allthough I liked some parts of the game, it's just not the best."
428340,Marmoset Hexels 3,Just Awesome!
428350,Fear Equation,"Fantastic game. Even though you never leave your compartment at the front of the train, it maintains a sense of tension throughout. While I'll admit it gets repetitive towards the end of a game, the moderate to high difficulty means that decisions can make or break an otherwise great run."
428370,Windlands,"my first review, after a few days' play: [playing on a VIVE] aargh this game is a brilliant concept and lovely graphics, but ruined for me by being almost completely unplayable... just too damn uncontrollable.. the controls seem inconsistent, you cant tell how big a jump is going to be, and half the time the button on the controller doesnt work (??) - the grappling hooks dont have enough 'pull', the easy setting is no easier than standard, there should be far more respawn points it is just too frustrating redoing the same section n times.....  and now, after two weeks' play: no, I was wrong - it really is amazing - once you get the controls sorted out. You need 'advanced ropes' OFF, cos that means they have no pull; and you need to start on EASY, where you can grapple any surface. And once you get used to it, the sense of soaring through the air is fantastic! - and keeps pulling you back..."
428410,PRiO,"Pure skill-based gameplay, solid presentation, but these levels desperately need to be clocked. We need leaderboards. This is such an ideal speedrunner."
428420,Room 404,"Doing a letsplay of this game, feel free to check it out -----&gt;  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF_pbGp6777A9tFGLNpYiNLKn7Q6eytep    So far the game seems to be a bit glitchy, and waaaaaaaaay too dark. But it has some really creepy moments that made me jump. If you're looking for a game that is well polished, you may want to look elsewhere. If you like indie games though, it may be worth checking out, just understand that it isn't for everyone."
428430,Endorlight,"  I'm a simple man, I played this game, I didn't like it."
428460,Kings of Israel,"If you've played the board game Pandemic, it's basically a cool reskin of that, but it's more luck-based with so much depending on which random resource cards you draw."
428510,Solitaire Christmas. Match 2 Cards,"In this game, you have to match cards by 2. Every power has to be bought whith hard obtained in-game money, so it's a bit hard, but pleasant."
428530,Machine Gun Train Run,"Not Online multiplayer, no audio options. this game is 2 bads in one."
428540,Fragments of Him,"Click on the turkey to recieve your next piece of dialogue, please.  Now click on the chair. No, not that chair, the other one. We'll get to that chair soon enough.  A hidden object narrative dispenser, where the hidden objects glow until you click on them. Then more words are said.   It could have been a moving experience, but the repetitive, pointless interaction makes the player a mere spectator to the characters' story."
428590,Unearthing Colossal,Tried playing this game and spent around 10 minutes at the 3rd puzzle as the text didnt appear. Then when it says to double hit d to dash it dosent work...... Needs work.
428690,Youtubers Life, Early Access Review
428740,Nordenfelt,"A fairly basic shoot 'em up with little depth. There's a very light skill tree and maybe five zones to clear.  The soundtrack is quite nice and gameplay isn't too bad, I played with controller and had no issues.  On the whole the game didn't hold my attention for more than an hour. Thus, while not a terrible game for the price point, I can't really recommend it."
428750,Neon Chrome,"  Boring, boring, boring. Neon Chrome is really little more than generic repetition at it's core. You spend most of the time grinding with absolutely nothing to make the experience stand out. It's just typical run n shoot with dull weapons.   Neon Chrome does as bad a job replicating it's cyberpunk inspirations as it does carving it's own identity. It's like someone who's never heard of cyberpunk before got an email describing some basic themes and aesthetic the day they went to work. Something something brain uploading blah blah robots blah blah neon. And about the neon: there are bright colors, yes, but they are bright like a clown is bright. Yellows, greens, and reds get tossed around liberally, but it looks nothing like like you'd imagine when you think 'neon'. See what I mean about that failure to understand the aesthetic it's going for?   I hate to make that the meat of this review(as bad as it is) but the actual game is just so boring I don't know what else to say. Run, shoot, get credits, run, shoot, get credits. I'm guessing the chance the game would really blow me away if I took dozens of hours to level up all my stats and get to the final boss is low. There are trillions of roguelikes released on Steam in the last couple of years, and about half of them are shooters. I can't think of a single reason you'd go for Neon Chrome over any of them, especially considering how bungled the theme is."
428760,Hatch and Slay,"This game is really annoying to play without an auto-clicker.  Even with an auto-clicker, it's a bit lame because when you get rewards, they only have a 1 in 5 chance of actually giving you something. This is the only way to get upgrades for your character, and it's not fun."
428800,liteCam Game 5.0,"I'm going to start off by saying that the Spec Requirements needs to be updated severely. In the description (which not a lot of people read) it lists a Quad Core i5 or i7 while the Spec Requirements only list ANY Dual Core. This is a significant difference.  From what I can tell, this is not supposed to 'impact' gaming by utilizing the CPU rather than GPU. On my system, it maxed out the CPU (all 8 cores) and caused significant frame drop upon recording a light-weight game. GPU utlization never toppled over 40% and that was just a one-time spike, average was 26%. Meanwhile, Xsplit uses 26% CPU and 21% GPU as average.  During recording, both microphone, and game audio became desynched by as little as 5 seconds but with lengthier videos, it was 20 seconds.  The settings for recording where a bit lacking but very good for such a light-weight program. The UI is very nice, both for Game recorder and Screen recorder. All-in-all, this program has great potential but needs a lot of core work to utilize the CPU better."
428830,Save the Dodos,  Fine for a mobile game but I expect a bit more of everything on the PC. Thought it to be more like Lemmings but it's just shuffling some plateau's around.
428870,Take the Dream IX,boring
428880,The Quest,"I really like this game! It's a lot like The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, but with less archaic interface and cotrols. If that sounds like something that you would be into, you will be. Also, it's pretty hard but very rewarding if you're really into dnd style stat building.  I really like all the npc interaction and stories. The artstyle is very charming and nostalgic but not in a cheap way, rather it feels very detailed and authentic. If I had the attention span I'd play this game way more often."
42890,Sword of the Stars Complete Collection,"this game does not live up to the hype from most of the good reviews here, I'm really disapointed, I expected a wast deep strategy with a lot of things to do, well there is hardly anything you can do, the AI sux and always attack you without reason, so forget to making friends with any of the races, and you can not run the game on high resolution, I only played for 30 minutes before I had enough. everything is not vissible on screen because of this, this is very bad because in the research screen you can not research everything avalible, you only get a hint there is more stuff there but you can't reach it, there are a lot better games than this if space strategy is what you wan't, this game is poorly updated to modern standards and not worth it, not even on sale. don't buy"
428900,"Linea, the Game","One of the worst games I've ever played in my life  Let's to details:  &gt; You'll start, straight to the tutorial (Congrats, you just lost an achievement forever) &gt; You will die, die, die, die, die, die, win an achievement for dying, dying, more and more (If you're smart you will quit the game now) &gt;You pass the tutorial (YAY) &gt;Level 1, more deaths, I beat 20 on score and give up  Good aspects:  &gt;You win achievements just discovering things in main menu or dying (And this gonna happening, believe in me)   The game isn't fun, it only makes you spend time and makes you angry. If you get for free, take it, but if you wanna buy, think twice."
428920,WinKings,Very nice campaign.
428940,CONTASION 2,"First boot: 'ERROR_D20D; not connected to the XA servers. Playing in demo mode.' After looking at the updates, the author says that that needs to be fixed by adding a seperate patch (which is, strangely, not automatically downloaded). Second boot: 'Patch added, please do not remove the exec.script file until the new update is deployed on Steam' Need to manually enter the serial code, okay.   A .midi file starts playing  Click Offline mode: black screen, ambient sound, rain, screen remains black. ALT TAB 'Contasion 2 is not responding'  Third boot:  A .midi file starts playing Click Online mode Need to make a Contasion 2 account (Steam account is not enough).  See that all the sessions are empty. Attempt to join one anyway. 'Thanks, Mark Overmars!' (the loading screen thanks the creator of Game Maker, some freeware apparently used to make this game?!).  Again the screen remains black. Contasion 2 is not responding.  This game is non functional at this time."
428950,"Kivi, Toilet and Shotgun","Well... kinda funny at start but then it's rly quick to get bored... needs more to be a good game. If you like this kind you may buy it and enjoy if you're rly big fan, well i'm sure you will leave it quick."
429020,LONE WOLF: Horizon, Early Access Review
429040,Furfly,It's a fun game don't ge wrong. It didn't grab me but didn't ♥♥♥♥ me off too much either. Ultimately though it's clearly a game that was meant for mobile. There are way better and more interesting platformers on Steam.
429050,Feed and Grow: Fish, Early Access Review
429060,Zombie Wars: Invasion,"You should not buy this game even if the price is cheap. You will regret it.  The game balance is totally broken as a tower defence game. There are few choking points to make towers effective. Zombies in this game shoot, without any reason."
42910,Magicka,"It doesn't work. I guess this is what I get for buying cheap crap. As soon as I have launched the game and the developers' logos have been displayed, the screen turns white, then black. When I tried to click in the darkness, it just took me to a store page for the DLCs. The ESC button works, but that just allows me to exit the game and it's so dark that I can barely see the letters. Can someone help me with this? If not, I just can't reccomend it."
429120,Zamarian,"A really terrible space shooter. You nagivate this ship with the mouse around this circular path field. Its super finnicky and oversensitive with no real way to change it. Some movements can make it go forward to a closer circle but its hard to control. You shoot guys along the path, or more the ship auto shoots and you stear. Thats it. Theres no special weapons or any other controls. Guys come in from the front, and even from behind you, which is dumb, and even worse, shots just from off the sides of the screen for no reason, leading to getting hurt for no reason and in an unavoidable manner. You collect jems, and in the worst UI decision ever, you have to maneuver your mouse off the middle of the screen to these random buttons you have to click. It doesn't stop the game, which is the best part. So you navigate and try and buy new ships when your ship gets low, or new weapons. None of the weapons or upgrades are explained so you have no idea what you're buying. Also you can't tell your ships damage because the indicator is poorly designed and makes no sense. Many times you can't tell if something is a collectible item, a shot, or a chunck of something, because of the bad blocky drab ugly textures, leading to other unnecessary damage. If you die you have to restart, but you can continue from a certain level. Nothing good about this game.   2.5/10."
429160,Cyborg Rage,"Every enemy we killed made the screen get brighter, until it was no longer playable. Co-op usually means couch co-op, apparently no so with this. It's online multiplayer, if you can find people on, but 2 minutes into the game we can't see anything. Not that it matters, because you move the mouse around and that's it, no other interaction. This game was given to us by Black Shell Media because we have a Let's Play channel, and we appreciate any game given to us. This is an insult that we wouldn't wish upon our worst enemies. This is like receiving the kiss of death."
429180,Project CARS - Pagani Edition,great car great track great game great gfx what more could you ask for a zonda at monza hell yeah
42920,The Kings' Crusade,"ENGLISH&amp;TURKISH REVIEW (Turkish review is in the comments)  Great concept, multiple regional units for both sides, strong medieval atmosphere. Makes you feel like Saladin or a crusader if you are on the wrong side of things... But it does not really matter, because you can not get past first battle of either scenario. It just crashes. This game crashes more than the Bandicoot himself...  All jokes aside, this game and Paradox in general is the real JOKE! Why? All they seem to care about is the DLC'n now. Where is that great Paradox these days? Yeah games are still solid but not fixing a well-known bug that makes playing the game impossible, is unacceptible. I am still a devoted fan of Paradox games and i buy every one of then (on sale though but does it really matter?). But this one really pisses me of, because as much as it seems like a bad imitation of Medieval Total War, it does have a unique character as a game. For a hardcore paradox and strategy fan, this game could have been a no-brainer.  I am very dissappointed that i have to downgrade this great concept and not have fun out of it. If they somehow decide to solve this problem, i'd be glad to buy this back and liberate the holy lands!"
429200,Super Helmets on Fire DX Ultra Edition Plus Alpha,"PERFECT, ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I EVER PLAY, 2016 BEST GAME 100%"
429220,FullBlast,"Starting with the basic information, FullBlast is a vertical Shmup (not a bullet hell) game based on the yet classical pattern of fighting the alien hoard that, for no apparent reason, invaded Earth. Its structure consists of three different play areas (Urban, Jungle and Arctic) each of these adding four maps to the aforementioned sector.  On terms of storytelling, you have only the casual before/after mission dialogues, rendering it clear, even from the beginning, that this game is not about the narrative but its more about enemy destruction (kinda default to the genre).  The background and the color palette is carefully blended with the gameplay, allowing a pleasant esthetic feel to each scenario, combined with proper contrast differentiations in between bullets, enemies, and playing fields.  With this in mind, you’ll have no problem distinguishing in between the latter mentioned, thus making bullet dodging accessible.  Turning to enemies and scoring rules, you basically have no multiplier mechanic, you score each time you kill an enemy and that is that, dampening replay ability and not being punitive at all, creating an overall sense of -easy game- even on HARD difficulty. Continuing a bit on the scoring part, if you want to indeed make a score worthy of the board, then the game allows you to practice each map alone, making it a plus for when you want to practice some thought to kill boss.  Embossing the easy part, if you really want to finish it fast, the game offers Local COOP play that will run you through the levels together with a sidekick. Player 2 will be able to move and fire either with the use of a keyboard or with the choice of a controller.   Enemy variety is indeed present but i don’t believe its enough, with very little exceptions every ship will fire with the exact same bullets, the sole true shoot revamp being felt only at boss fights.  Weapon wise, you have two shooting styles – in line and cone, that will multiply in damage and bullets with every drop you take of the enemy you kill. Important thing to mention is that once you lose a life, you’ll basically lose all weapon upgrades, forcing you to restart the grind from zero.  Nevertheless, drops are present and are there to fall off only one particular enemy type, this being notified to the player by a specific sound. Drops consist of Shield, Health, Weapon Upgrades, Score multiplier, Fire rate increase and Slow (the only negative drop).  Last but not least, lets talk about the control scheme. The default setup is Arrows (Directional), ALT (Special), Control (Normal Fire). Now, even though these might seem decent enough, considering the Windows 10 screen flip shortcut of ALT+CTRL+ARROW, I quickly learned that I need to change these defaults and I suggest you do the same before actually jumping in and play.  Overall, the game is not bad, quite relaxing at some points when you simply want to doze off and shoot some stuff of the screen. But that is all, if you want to play a truly competitive shooter such as the Asian classics (Ikaruga, DoDonPachi etc) then this is not the game for you. At its core, it feel its build as a casual/mobile experience which looks, sounds and feels good to that extent."
429250,Beyond Dimensions,"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed in playing this. The Trailer looked fairly promising. Not to sat this game doesn't have an interesting premise,b ut some of the mechanics need to be tweaked:     Actually HIDE the secret chest, so they can be accessed w/o needing a fire spell to light torches to unlock    dial down the number of mobs on the 1st floor or up the damage on some of the spells (ie Life Drain is too slow)  These can be easily fixed.  The MAIN issue holding this back is the ENVIRONMENT.   If you think of games like Dungeon Souls (another game published by Black Shell Media), the Music, Dungeon Design, Items, Mobs, and Bosses have a dynamic look to them; despite the games dark atmosphere/premise. This game sadly has a boring look and feel to it. The mobs are generic and killing them gives no satisfaction. The music is just a carry over from the opening credits and is too bland to enjoy. Mostly the dungeon is just a collection of black wall that reveal themselves as you move closer.  Don't get me wrong! This has a chance of being a really good game, but the devs would have to do a rehaul of the game environment to bring out it's potential. Now if the first dungeon is just something to gt the player used to the game mechanics, fine. Judging from what I've played, I wouldn't recommend it to others as is.   You can see my run of it  HERE!  "
429260,Super Intergalactic Gang,played with my girlfriend and had an awesome time beating it. Absolute recommendation to play it with someone else!
429280,Gems of the Aztecs,"What a strange match-3 game... At first, i didn't like it, because of limited moves and the need of paying earned coins to use a power. But after a while, i realized i had to play differently, thinking more every move and i started to like it."
42930,Elven Legacy: Magic,"DLC to a game I dislike. But on the other hand, it is a good deal when you buy it in package. And on Sale. Still not my cup of coffee."
429300,Sepia Tears,"I found myself being a bit distant from this Visual novel because I had made assumptions. As I read on though, I found myself immersed in the story! ^-^ The story is very interesting and enjoyable to read, the music that goes along with it is relaxing and brings me back memories of my own. The ending was very beautiful (:   10/10 \^-^/"
429330,Stikbold!,"This is an absolute mess. This port is insanely bad, and they had no intent of keeping some sort of playerbase to pc. Why make a local co op game good for 5 minutes of laughs. This is jsut another meme game being pushed out by the powers that be. and is to be avoided at all costs. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money."
429350,Satellite Rush, Early Access Review
429390,XenoShyft,"Playing this game would be amazing if it didn't freeze every time we were doing half decently. Please fix the freezing that we suffer in multiplayer!  Edit: 12\2\2016 There was an attempt to fix said lack of playability literally the day after I wrote the review initially. While I applaud the attempt to fix the issue, The new time bar for progressing the game can some times freeze, which unfortunately causes the game to not progress.  We've made sure that everyone had a ready status in our group, but no dice. So in the end, it still comes down to the game freezing on us when we play. I give props for the developers at least trying, and I can't wait to see a fix that works! It's only happened twice so far. So we managed to actually finish our games for once. Had a great time too!"
42940,Elven Legacy: Siege,"DLC to a game I dislike. But on the other hand, it is a good deal when you buy it in package. And on Sale. Still not my cup of coffee."
429430,Tyrfing Cycle |Vanilla|, Early Access Review
429490,Resilience Wave Survival,"GOOD: Great visual tweaks and parameter tweaks, interesting atmosphere (even better depending on how you tweak it).   BAD:  -Graphics settings are all there, but on my decent rig I couldn't get 60 fps on the lowest possible settings at 1080p (peaks at about 45-50) all while getting a choppy 30 fps at max settings at 1080p -There is no A.I... Enemies will just run at you no matter where you are.   TLDR: There's nothing that makes this a game, but if you like taking screenshots, you might like this.  I enjoy simple games and this has the potential to be really good, like I wouldn't mind paying upwards to 15 dollars for this if it was complete 100%. Right now, I look at this game as being 10% complete. "
42950,Elven Legacy: Ranger,"DLC to a game I dislike. But on the other hand, it is a good deal when you buy it in package. And on Sale. Still not my cup of coffee."
429520,Falcon Gold,Remorse - 1999 EDITION 10/10
429530,Falcon 4.0,"Certainly the best simulation of the F-16 out there. The game will run stock from steam on Windows 10, but to really get the best experience download the Falcon BMS mod that updates the graphics and pit to make it look a lot better. Be warned. This is a hardcore simulator with many buttons clickable and functional in the F-16. Even getting off the ground is a challenge such as starting this plane. It's certainly for fans of the F-16. Ever wanted to get a feel for what the real pilots have to do then this is for you. Love being able to be in full control of a virtual F-16, then this is for you. The time it takes to learn is what makes it fun. It's also a really cheap way to get into the F-16 and probably one of the best simulations of this bird that you can currently get while not looking like a game from the 80s with the BMS mod. Don't play the game without the BMS mod. It used it with th hotas x stick and appart from changing a couple of the axis I was good to go straight away."
429570,The Walking Dead: Michonne,"If it was longer and fleshed out, it could have been a decent game. Only worth on a very low sale. Kills a couple of hours"
429580,A Wild Catgirl Appears!,"This has a lot of negatoive reviews, so I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, but I understand it's been actively worked on and improved since released. It's short and sweet--and the characters are also sweet. Despite the comically large breasts on some of the characters (oh, Lise), the art is clean and pretty, and I like the twin themes of gaming and coming out. A nice way to spend some time."
42960,Victoria II,Pop up clicker simulator. That's what this game is. You click on pop ups. Then after about a few hours of clicking on pop ups your whole country rebels and you die. That's the game.
429600,Fairy Tale Mysteries: The Puppet Thief,Played on expert to start for only 1 play through. The HOs were very challenging because they were quite bleak looking. Some of the puzzles were pretty tough too. The story was fine. The bonus chapter seemed to lead into the sequel.
429610,The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams,This game is so nice :)  Is for smart people
429620,Dungeon Rushers,Maybe I didn't spend enough time in the game but it felt very basic and repetitive.
429680,Spellweaver," Very similar playstyle to M:TG but has a few new ideas that make it unique. It has more decision making then most card games (like Hearthstone), and it feels rewarding.  Business model is fair, earning currency and getting cards is easy. You are frequently given quests (every 8 hours), most of which you can finish against AI (AI itself is competent). Some harder quests will also give you premium currency.  Card art is beautiful, and the UI is well designed. Developers seem nice, and are actively keeping an eye on card balance.  Only downside for me is the currently small card pool (more card sets are coming in a few months).   Best digital card game on steam.   Chicken Fiesta."
429690,Astro Duel,"A perfectly formed little party game. Tight controls, nice pixel art, meaty sound effects and thumping soundtrack. I've had a lot of fun playing it local multiplayer and would highly recommend it."
429700,Squirbs,"Although the concept, graphics, and music are all very good, the thing that breaks this game for me is that it doesn't play right. Let me explain. Everything in the game is functional, but it doesn't feel right. The part that especially doesn't feel right is the edges of platforms. Specifically jumping off them. Sometimes you have to restart a level about 15 times for jumping at the edge of a platform to work right and when you have to make eight similar jumps in the level, it gets very repetitive and boring. This isn't a terrible game, it just needs a little bit of fixes."

429780,Bunny Hop League, Early Access Review
429790,AdventureQuest 3D, Early Access Review
42980,Victoria: Revolutions,"I played this a lot more before I had it on Steam. This is for any historical enthusiast who wants the power to control a country. The graphics is nothing special. The music is from the era and the historical events are all accurate.   For the gameplay. This game can be slightly shallow if you only want to wage war. This in itself is fun and rewarding. There is however a very deep game hidden in this crazy awesome world conquering masterpiece. As you play the game with different countries you will notice that you can build up the industrialization by educating the people and build factories and railroads. You can also just let the capitalists roam free and build your riches on the broken backs of the working class. You have to fight corruption and rebells. Will you fight them or bend to their will? Is democracy really that great when you know whats best for them?   I Highly recommend this game, but there is some downside.   - Manually taking care of trading or educate the people is way to much work. - Progress is a bit too slow. - It’s extremely addictive. I’ve lost hours thinking it has gone minutes. - There is a Victoria 2 and maybe even 3. These should be (but doesn’t have to be) better."
429830,Unseen Diplomacy,"One would think that with an option for Restricted Space, the game could accomodate people without a massive 4m x 3m, but nope. The option has no effect, rendering the game unplayable. Any other game would opt for a simple teleport function to get around space constrictions, but not this game. So the question is, why have a Restricted Space option in the first place? All it did was give me false hope to be able to play it. Dumb."
42990,Sword of the Stars II: Enhanced Edition,"If you are looking for a better turn based strategy experience, try the normal version of Sword of the Stars 2. While this one looks pretty, it is just pretty confusing. Even more so if you played the normal version of Sword of the Stars 2. The menus are a mess and the in-game guide might superficially explain something enough that you might figure out how to do what you wanted. I hate to be a little negative, but this might better be called the Unhanced Edition. Avoid this one and get the regular Sword of the Stars 2. It plays better and is less encumbered with strange menu mechanics."
429940,The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns,Dreadfully addictive. I shudder when I picture the faces of friend or relative whom knew I clicked my way through an Anime goth visual novel.
429950,ABO MANDO,con: this game  pro: cards
4300,RoboBlitz,"It has a weird charm about it. The puzzles are nice and clever, the humour only occasionally resulting in a smile from me, and it looks nice. My biggest complaint is the physics. It makes the game really frustrating at times, especially the platforming. Worth a look, but it's quite short and prepare to be frustrated quite a bit."
43000,Front Mission Evolved,"I wanted to love this game, I really did, but it's just average and can't recommend for any particular interest. For a game about piloting giant robots, you'll find yourself surprisingly unempowered. Note that this is my first Front Mission, unlike most reviewers I've read.  The worldbuilding and overall setting is pretty interesting, voice acting is pretty good (although most dialogues lack creativity and script could've used a couple rewrites).   Gameplay is average. Controls are pretty responsive however there's no strategy or thinking at all for the fights. There's no cover system, enemies can pack a punch really early into it and your weapons deal little damage (except for your rockets that are incredibly OP) so it's just 'get behind a building. poke out, shoot a little, enter again. Rinse. Repeat.' Your mobility is limited by a boost bar so it's just short bursts (dodge) or slow walking instead of a fluid movement system. (There's a burst for movement but it's pretty useless for fights). You'll find yourself lacking either agility or power constantly through tedious levels.   Level design is good enough.  Bosses are surprisingly even more uncreative in terms of gameplay. You're just in a cage (you don't feel yourself in danger, just limited) where you dodge predictable attack sequences and shoot. If they were a little more open or interesting (in terms of enemy attacks/level design) I'd love them.  Story was pretty OK up to the point I got to. Nothing groundbreaking, but nothing really bad either. I've heard many complaints in this particular area so maybe it gets worse later, but I haven't found anything terrible yet, just cliches and 'could have been done better' moments. Anyways don't play for the story alone.  Customization is decent, but not great.  Soundtrack is Okayish... Does it job, but nothing groundbreaking either.  Multiplayer is as dead as it can be. Don't even bother looking for a game.  If you want an action robot customization game, just go play Custom Robo. If you want a strategy robot customization game, just go play Super Robot Taisen. If you want a shooter... Well, I don't know, but this is not the game for you sadly."
430020,Dance of Death,"Pros:  1. Interesting puzzles, some of them quite innovative. 2. The same may be said about the HO scenes. 3. The music and graphics are not bad.  Cons: 1. Extremely simplistic and dull story. 2. Horrible digitized characters. 3. Very poor voice acting. 4. Lack of a map (well, perhaps is too short to have a map). 5. Short."
430080,Elysium: Blood Games,00000000/10
430170,Babel: Choice,While the game looks visually beautiful and the idea behind it is worth while in its attempt how the actual combat and gameplay is set up leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to this rougelike game. For more details check out my full first impression review         YouTube™ Video:  Babel:Choice-Ant Plays! (Review)&nbsp;
430190,Wondershot,I have played the single player which is a bunch of levels that you try to score the best time for challenges. Some of them are just shooting targets that pop up and some of the challenges have ai that attack. I think I am enjoying the single player component more than I will the local multiplayer. I recommend this game.
430230,Grass Max,What you have here is something no worth the time it takes to download. Collect more grass than the other players that is if you can find anyone else to join in a game. Buy this game and you will definitely get a refund.
430280,Nature Defenders,"Okay, first things first.  It was 1:30 AM, two days after Christmas. My friend decided to be generous and get me some games for Christmas. Little did I know, it was going to be a combination of furries and cancer. This game requires ZERO strategic knowledge or adaptability, and the English localization is downright awful. The music makes my ears bleed, and the graphics are like Super Metroid on crack.  P.S. WHY THE HELL DOES THE GAME REQUIRE 8 GIGS OF RAM TO BE PLAYED?!  Thanks, Fesh God. You ♥♥♥♥ing monster."
430290,Shmups Skill Test,It's like Brain Age except it actually helps you in your everyday life.
430300,MINUS ZERO,"If it wasn't for the odd choice of special effects vomit all over the screen the game would be pretty decent. You fly your little triangle around and blow up circles. Don't feel bad if you can't tell what's going on from the screenshots, it doesn't get any easier when you start playing either. I've played a few shmups (I'm in no ways an expert however) but this one makes my eyes bleed. Controls are fine, progression takes a bit. You can see other peoples scores and watch (some) replays of their runs.  See my video on youtube.   https://youtu.be/CjT-KHjSzfg "
430930,Z. Year One, Early Access Review
430960,Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-,"This is a picture book that outlines some of humanities flaws. I understand that a little is lost intranslation, but it's clear the authers are intellegent. The interaction points don't seem to change the plot, but are well done as is the art.   I'm a huge fan of the old style 'choose your own adventure' books and I like subtitles because they help me learn other launguages. I'd LOVE to see full adventures done in this style, The bigger and the more choices and greater the differnces they make on the story the better the re-read-ability / listen.  So over all I'm pleased with the idea, but dissapionted with the story. I'd like to work with the devs on projects like this. With a few minor changes this format could redo all the classic novels for all age groops, and mabe we could try to make them end the way we (the reader's) want :) (or better yet twist our decisions to get us to see the errors in our ways).   Lots of potential, a change of pace, but i think they missed the mark on this one.... But keep trying !!!"
43100,World of Zoo,"World of Zoo is for kids. I seriously can’t recommend this to any gamer who is serious about gaming. While the name does bring up some Zoo Tycoon references, it plays absolutely nothing like it. If Nintendogs ever went zoo mode, this would be it. You spend the entire game poking the animal you are taking care of, while also feeding them enough food to cause diabetes. Each and every animal have the same two personalities; happy because you pamper them and utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you’re a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ zoo keeper. Apparently alligators do chase their tails, and lions won’t kill you if you chuck a beach ball at them. Total lack of realism in a flipping zoo game, sorry can’t recommend."
431180,WolfQuest: Classic,"i love this game! i cant wait with more updates! but if i have a list of things i want in the game here it is ( you dont HAVE to put it in the game but i think it will be kinda cool) More Skins for the wolves: like maybe one that kinda looks a bit like a fox with the black paws? i love foxes! Add in Humans? like what if in a random day theres a day called Hunting Season ( idk u choose ) and then the humans come out to kill animals, Bunnies, Coyotes, your pups! i think it could be cool and they can have guns! Add in a story to Lost River: when you get a mate in Lost River it says you cannot have pups, why is that? maybe you can have like a Good Ending, Bad Ending and Neutral Ending. ( i got this from a comment in a wolf quest video )  Good Ending: if you get a mate theres a thing that happens and you need to run away from it with your mate and go to Slough, if you make it out alive with your mate you go to Slough to raise pups. Neutral Ending: You make it out alive with your mate but your bady hurt and get a limp in your leg or something. Bad Ending: You make it out alive with injures but your mate dies, you go to Amethest to find another mate but you die once you get your pups from the injures. idk i just thought it will give Lost River some more love c: "
431220,Porradaria 2: Pagode of the Night,  10/10  Killed a demon called oniisama.  Beautiful graphics and sounds. Voice acting is spectacular.  This game is unique and worth every penny.
431230,Tiny Guardians,There are only 2 reasons not to get this game.  1st it is extremely drag on drop reliant. Which means if you're using a touchpad it gets very frustrating very quickly. If they ever put in an option to switch from drag and drop to point and click it'd be more friendly to all versions 2nd The game is much cheaper with the phone version.   So if you can overlook or work around those to things then THIS GAME IS PRETTY DARN GOOD.

431250,Mushroom Wars,"I looked at the screen shots and thought this would be fun for a little bit. I was wrong. You need to control every single unit, grow stronger and figure out how to outdo an ai that does exactly what you are doing with no mistakes. Basically you just have to outnumber your for in every way. Was not fun."
431260,Cursed,"Warning: This game is broken and glitchy. I got nearly to the end and think I did something out of order and it broke the game. I can't assemble the final piece... and I'm really salty about it. I'm not going to go through 93% of this boring game again just to see the crappy ending.  For the type of game it is, it is somewhat pretty. But it is super straightforward and the puzzles aren't hard at all. Find a thing that goes somewhere super obvious... rinse, repeat.   Don't waste your money even if it is on sale."

431330,Dungeons Are Random,"There are good stuff in this game and some bad stuff that make this game not so good.   The good stuff is dungeons being random which will make any game a unique experience. The bad stuff is probably the control. I could not do much with melee weapons while I was able to make my way with a simple bow. Hence if you don't get a bow at the start, you sort of good for a quick death.   From what it seems this game seems to be a single person project. I could say kudos on that but with many games of the same genre available with better playability and implemented ideas in the same Steam price range, Dungeons Are Random lacks of the little extra notch, polishing and a serious dose of playtesting that will make it a great or at least good game and not looking like some game prototypes or school projects.  For a low price or in a bundle, this is a good game to get when you have to kill 10-15 min in a rogue game. For the current asked price, this is way too much to pay for the fun the game creates.     "

431370,Diorama No.3 : The Marchland,"I understand that this is just an interactive illustration, but there's just not much to it. You can't interact with some of the objects around you and others you can, but I can't tell what the point of any of that interaction is. It is fairly inexpensive, so there's not much risk in getting it but there's so many other compelling VR experiences out there now that this one doesn't bring anything new to the table."
431390,Diorama No.1 - Blocked In,"Kind of like an interactive painting, but without much interacting except for moving around the space. It's nice to just boot up and sit and listen to the radio or the game music as blocks slowly fall in and out of frame, casting shadows into the room. $1.99 isn't too bad for all the love and care you can see went into this Diorama. Curious where #2 is though. May look into buying #3. Keep up the good work! Loved the little box diorama that came before the actual Blocked In room."
431410,Mazement,"Quite nice looking game with pleasing soundtrack, play through lasted 2h without rushing. The levels are increasingly more difficult but never really hard. an ideal nobrainer on a sunday afternoon. I would recommend this if bought on discount."

431510,Mystic Destinies: Serendipity of Aeons,"I have mixed feelings about recommending this game.  On the one hand, I got involved with the story by the end of the free 'demo' section and could certainly empathize with the main character and her attempts to deal with what life threw at her and to win over the love interest. I don't regret buying DLC for my preferred route (Shinji) and the story was interesting enough (although a little predictable at times) and reached a satisfactory end.   However I have seen comments that the Shinji route is the most extensive one. I am not prepared to pay more for further DLC, expecially if they are shorter than the set I have. So I think that the value for money is not too good, given that in nearly all of these games you have the opportunity to try out all the routes at a lower price than the full DLC would cost.  I think if you are only really interested in Shinji then it may be worthwhile.  "
431540,Frosty Kiss,"If you haven't played Everlasting Summer before, don't bother with this game.  It's hard to call it a complete game or visual novel, as each scenario only takes a few minutes to play and there are only six of them. I like to see this more like a feel-good Christmas movie but in a New Years Eve setting instead of Christmas. It provides a nice, happy epilogue for the characters in Everlasting Summer.  The visual arts are nice and the music as well.  What would really improve this game is a proper proof-reading. Either that or having its English translation completely remade as it's rather bad, and at times incomprehensible. Another letdown is that the achievements don't work and haven't worked for a year after the games' release date, even after repeated promises by the game devs that the achievements will be fixed."

431600,Automobilista, Early Access Review
431610,Hubert's Island Adventure: Mouse o' War,Solid game to pick up and play. As you walk through the world it's easy to see that is 2d top down shooter isn't the most graphic intensive game out there. There are however redeeming factors such as the helpful attitude the game shows toward the player and the competitive high learning curve progress. If you can see past the confusing interface this game is a blast for a few hours and maybe even more if you want to be the best.

43190,The Haunted: Hells Reach,"The game is very repetitive, although there are a few enemies, but everything seems to restricted and narrow. I was playing Beginner difficulty, but there's just no thrill or suspense after a few minutes. The multiplayer seems dead, too."

432010,World's Dawn,"Because you guys didn't get the point of my review i have changed it a little bit, maybe its more clear now:  MY OPINION, NOT YOURS(!): This game is so friggin' boring. The first 'mission' is to find all 26 villagers and that takes forever, hoping that after that it would get better but it wasn't. Besides that the mechanics are very basic like a flash game, looking weird. You can say that this game isn't for me, that could be true but doesn't change my opinion. Really had to go for a refund. 11 euro's is way to expensive for me, for this game."

432190,Chef Solitaire: USA,"Seems fun for awhile, but gets repetative in a bad way. Buying upgrades seems like it's an after thought, and not well planned. Was able to buy every upgrade in the first 20% of the game, money had no other purpose after that. Achievement tied to doing perfect on a level, but the level ends when you meet the goals, regardless of if you could finish clearing the board. Mindless fun if you're bored of regular solitaire, but not really worth it in the long run."
432230,"Axe, Bow & Staff","A fantastic, surprisingly lengthy game (7 hours to defeat final level), evocative of classic retro games in a way no other game has quite managed to capture for me personally. Co-op is more or less a neccessity, however. Frequently glitchy, however they never fail to be interesting or hilarious, almost as if they were left in intentionally. Pretty easily one of the best co-op experiences available on Steam, and definitely deserving of a lot more recognition."

432250,Soviet City, Early Access Review
432260,Tiltagon,"10/10 Mega fun and such smooth gameplay it's minimally frustrating!  But beware, Hexagons are jerks...  Sometimes they'll just bash you. Sometimes they'll be flailing one, or both, arms around to get in your way. Sometimes they'll shoot you. And sometimes you'll even fall through a hexagonally shaped hole.  This game perfectly balances greed and patience, especially in the Hard+ gamemode; let me tell you, there is not a better feeling in that mode than collecting the next block before that hexagon shoots its load!  Which will come first, the 5000 games played or the 100 points in Hard+ achievement?  With the slick movement, respawning, and UI, you also get tons and tons of cosmetically appealing balls to use, after you've unlocked them of course.  Oh why does a ball have to be so spherical!? And why do hexagons have to be so mean?"
432290,Elemental Heroes,"It has all the pieces to be very engaging (cards, upgrades, an rpg leveling system); but the combat is fairly simplistic and doesn’t increase in difficulty of type (same thing but bigger numbers). It was worth a look but not a long term play"
432310,Virtual Pool 4 Multiplayer,Lol the game simply doesnt run...
432330,Rytmik Lite Chiptune Synthesizer,"The true at this moment i can not recommend this software. It is easy to manipulate, but need more explanations about the effects of the levers and the terminologies. People with expierence will probably have a great time, but noobs with zero knowledge (like me) are going to find tedidous correcting mistakes and missplacement of clips, adjusting sounds, etc."
432370,Sethian,"In another universe, I might have liked Sethian. The game's concept somewhat appealed to me. Working out a new language can definitely be fun; I remember once in high school when I got bored and compared a Russian version of the Bible with the English version, just to see if I could deduce some phrases by this method; that was definitely a fun 20-minute experience. So seeing a game like this definitely piqued my interest.  Upon booting, I was instantly hurled into a keyboard with unfamiliar buttons and so on. I feel like this works slightly against Sethian's favour. After a short while, a prompt popped up saying 'Right-click to open the journal', so I did so.  The journal contained some story and some helpful hints to get started (e.g. how to ask 'What are you?'). So naturally, I followed the journal's prompt, keyed in 'What are you?' and was met with a complete barrage of symbols I didn't understand. Checking the journal again revealed more text explaining what everything was and what to ask next. Alright, fine, fair enough. So I then asked 'What is [some string of symbols]?' and the computer replied. This went on for some time.  One of the things I quite hate doing when it comes to puzzle games is looking up a walkthrough. Having to look up a walkthrough makes me feel like I'm not smart enough to get the solution to the puzzle. But here, in effect, a walkthrough is forced upon the player in the form of the journal. Not being fluent in Sethian (the name of the language in question), I found myself having to read the journal after every single reply to figure out what everything meant, in effect making the journal a walkthrough.  The second problem is that later on in the game, you're allowed to right-click a symbol to show what it means (it's a page of the journal). This too is good, only sometimes you end up in a situation where the whole screen is filled with symbols and you need to right-click the tiny spaces in between to get to the part of the journal with the story. UGH.  The annoying part is, though, the damn punctuation. Yes, there are pages in the journal that detail how they work, but there's no way to quickly access how to use them other than opening up the journal and flipping through to the page in question. I can't right-click the 'double dot' symbol and be told how to use it, for example. But the punctuation is so integral to the game, in that not getting your punctuation right results in the computer replying with 'I do not understand', that this just results in frustration when my questions aren't accepted as valid, simply because I missed out a tiny little dot or used '._' instead of '_.' and didn't notice.  What's more annoying, though, is the lack of ability to jump to a space in the input. Having to continually backspace and retype a mistyped answer completely kills the game when it turns out you 'merely' missed out a dot near the start of your 20-symbol-long sentence.  Then I hit a bottleneck, where I was told by the journal that I should 'ask more questions' about previous things. But every single question I asked was hit with 'I do not understand', and the journal never updated after this. Was I asking the wrong questions? Or were my questions merely not grammatically correct? There was no way for me to tell.  I think this game may have been playtested only by the developers. All signs point to 'the game is really fun if you're already fluent in Sethian'. Fluency in Sethian would completely nullify every single one of my problems, since I probably wouldn't even have to consult the journal at all, and would be able to see if my punctuation were correct. Having removed the language barrier, conversing with the computer might actually be fun. But the point of the game is that you  don't  know Sethian! And this lack of knowledge has led me to discover all these problems the developers seem to not have picked up on.  A good deal of the game might well have been improved had I had an overlay (say, holding down the SHIFT key), to tell me what all the symbols meant so that I didn't have to constantly go back to my reference guides. That way, I might also be able to tell if our sentence was grammatically correct before asking it.  Or maybe, if we somehow had the player already know Sethian, but the strain of Sethian used in the game was an unknown dialect of Sethian. Of course, in that case, it may as well have been made in English instead, and would probably have a similar gameplay to The Gostak. But if I had to choose between this game and The Gostak, I would definitely choose The Gostak, because at least there I can actually understand some things without having to constantly resort to an unhelpful manual that never opens to the right page.  Yes, these suggestions might ruin the difficulty of the game. But as it is now, I feel like the game's just trying to get in the way of telling a story that may well be interesting. If Braid was a game where, according to Ben Croshaw, 'a game where the gameplay and story are kept in separate rooms with you in the gameplay room looking into the story room via a tiny hole in the dividing wall', Sethian feels like a game where the gameplay slaps you away every time you try to even peek through the hole. I think I might even have preferred Sethian more had it not  had  a story.  The story, though, was indeed intriguing, and the premise was nice. As it is, though, I constantly ended up mistyping *something*, or not being sure quite what to ask. In short, good concept, unfriendly execution. Get this if you're a polyglot or are training to become one. Otherwise, you're going to have a rough time."

432410,The Sacred Stone: A Story Adventure, Early Access Review
432470,Magdalena,"For the price the game is pretty decent: graphics are great, it's nice that you can interact with every object, and the storyline is fine (at least to the point I managed to get).   On the other side: it's super dark outside - I can't see a damn thing. Also some intro explaining the storyline would be nice, but there isn't any.  But my biggest issue is that the game runs really slow, even if my computer meets the system requirements (according to my son who helped with this. He also told me to turn off some settings in the game, but it didn't help).  If the creators of this game made some kind of new version, or improvements, then this would be a pretty good game. In the meantime, I will give Magdalena a little recommendation for its graphics and storyline!"

432610,Monumental, https://youtu.be/oZ0KUUH3yRo   I have not played a lot of this game yet but it is fun from what i have played so far. Controls are a little iffy and there seems to be some input lag problems but the story seems decent and the puzzles are pretty good. Graphics are also not too bad most of the time but there are some parts that look horrible but hey they are usually in places where you are not usually looking to be fair. If you want to see more i would appreciate if you watched my video on it :)
432620,Mimic Arena,"If you're looking for a great local multiplayer experience, Mimic Arena is the way to go! I played this at PAX last year in an indie game arcade machine and people were lining up to play it even though it wasn't a part of the show floor. (Came back multiple times to play more too!) Got it in a Groupees Greenlight Bundle and I'm glad to see that it's finally launched! Can't wait to get some friends together and play the hell out of it! :D"

432760,Small Town Terrors: Galdor's Bluff Collector's Edition,"Assisting to the premier of Thurman's new trick on his request, he is victim of an accident. You know that he was sure that his rival was sabotaging his work. It's now up to you to find what Galdor's Bluff is hiding!  Small Town Terrors is a series of hidden objects games, focused on one town hiding a secret. After an evil entity and zombies, Galdor's Bluff is focusing on illusions and is less oriented in paranormal and horror themes. The story is well-written, as you don't expect the twist at the end.  The gameplay is the usual one: find items, use them in specific locations, solve puzzles, find objects thanks to a list of them or to replace the missing one to its place. The puzzles are quite easy to solve and the hidden objects scenes aren't hard at all. It's just a shame that the mechanisms of two characters you can switch are only explored in the bonus chapter.  The graphics are correct: while it's not an apocalyptic setting, it's still a town visited during the night. Though the majority of the locations are normal, some of them are situated in ruins, getting a little touch of mystery. The soundtrack is also correct.  As it's a collector's edition, you have concept arts, the bonus chapter, wallpaper and a solitaire game. Indeed, each hidden object scene can be passed thanks to a solitaire card game where you can remove cards when their sum is matching 13.  There are also achievements in-game but not on Steam, which is a little disappointement.  Anyway, Galdor's Bluff is really enjoyable, way more than Livingstone but Pilgrim's Hook stays still my favorite game in the series. Anyway, you can go ahead."
432780,Dream Catcher Chronicles: Manitou,"A pretty little Hidden Object Game with Minigames in between for variety. All in all maybe a tad too easy at time. The story is nice, graphics are good in my opinion.  You have a time-recharged skip button if you can not find something or are stuck.  Is it worth 10 bucks ? I highly doubt that. For less - get it if you like the genre. :)"
432870,Special Tactics Online,"This game was a good idea, but still feels like it should be in early access.   Would recommend if it was updated to show things like better line of sight, and was more clear on what areas are walls and what aren't. The AI sometimes does very stupid things.  Get the game on sale for at least 60% off in its current condition of today."

433000,Lost Lands: The Golden Curse,"I was 'kindly' asked to rate the game, so...  If you shove a huge 'buy our other games' screen at the start of the game and a 'rate this game now' screen after every chapter, I feel like I can wholeheartedly not recommend this game. The game itself is quite complicated to play as you hardly ever know where to use which item and backtracking to the start of the game happens all the time. The presentation is fine, but the puzzles and mini games are all rather bland.  Please remove this advertisment nonsense from your game. Thank you."
433100,The Town of Light,"i don't know how to describe that game . that game is so beautiful , words may denaturates it . i'll try to give a brief description though so you can have an idea if it's worth the purchase or not . first , this is NOT a survival/psycological horror game , absolutely not . during the whole game i never ever got scared even during 2 seconds . then this is not really a game but more a story . there are few puzzles but they are very/extremelly? easy to solve . but however that game is one of the rare games i keep thinking to even after having stopped playing it . that game carries you into the world of the 40s mad , you keep obssessed by the game even after having let down the gamepad . There are books you read that will entertain you, and they are books that you'll remind until the day you die, TTOL belongs to the latest category One last thing the game protagonists Renee and Amara are fictional. but the game is based on events that really occured. and it relates them in an accurate way I recommend playing in Italian with subtitles for total immersion"

433210,Rhino's Rage,"  Would probably be better on the mobile devices it's clearly been ported from.  Even then, the game is:  - Grindy - Luck based - Kind of broken  I can't speak for everyone, but for me, it crashed literally every time I tried starting a new match after selling my junk equipment. Being as I like to not have useless items making my inventory look untidy, I sell after every match, so this means I had a crash after every single match.  For the record, to sell items, you have to click the item you want to sell, then click the now highlighted 'sell' button. Dragging and dropping, right clicking, or double clicking doesn't work."
433280,Warlords Battlecry III,"I realy wish steam had a 50/50 Option. Played this when i was a kid probably played the Demo for 200+ Hours, Full game nonSteam would easily go 300+ hours. But as someone who played the latest 'Offical' Patch i can't recommend this games 'Fan' Patch version. Also has no 1920 x 1080p option and is always 4:3.  Its a NO for the Steam Version Its a YES for the Game I'd still buy it if it was 40$"
433300,Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,"This is awesome. Was scared that controller wouldnt work based on other reviews, but 360 controller worked perfect, not sure if I have a patched version or not, but it works and is fantabulous. looks good, not an upgrade really but plays as I remember (and just played it last week on my 360, so boom). Great game, love it."
433320,Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2,"The controller issues are still present but they can be fixed with a simple XInput correction. Apart from that the game runs fine and is lots of fun for any Marvel fan. Highly recommended! Plus, you can't go wrong with the Civil War storyline."
433350,BlackShot: Mercenary Warfare FPS,"Horrible game. They advertise it to make it look much better than it really is, this is basically a remake of CSGO and SF2. There are hackers in every game and it is horrible."
433360,Drawn: Dark Flight,"Short but fun puzzle adventure with stunning artstyle, but sadly falls a little short on the story.  First of all - artstyle, drawings, little puzzles with children-book artstyle - these are all stunning and beautiful! Loved the atmosphere it created.  Puzzles are not too hard, but very varied so not boring. They won't give much challenge to veterans, but at the other hand it makes game accessible to genre newbies.  As for other reviews mentioning constant crashes - I only encountered a single crash during my playthrough after alt-tabbing, so maybe it's already fixed ;)  Only bad thing I found about this game is that while it's story idea seems very intresting we're getting almost no backstory until almost the end of the game when we no longer care that much. Story has potential but should be developed through whoe game, not only in last 30 minutes.  Anyway - it's still worth a try! :&gt;"
433380,Back in 1995,So despite all the negative comments and generally mixed reviews I picked this game up because of my love for retro survival horror games and old styled games in general. I won't spoil anything but I will say if you enjoy old school survival horror style games like PS1's Alone in the dark or Silent Hill I would reccomend this game. It is very short and while its no masterpiece I think its a fun worthwhile time for the price!

I still have a boxed (yes BOXED) copy of this game on my shelf.   Unfortunately the steam version has serious display issues on my screen. Graphics issues and frequent black screens make it nearly unplayable.   DESPITE that, I'm still recommending it. On sale right now its just a little over a dollar. Buy it and pray they patch the graphics issues!"
433590,The Song of Seven : Overture,"I started this game up excited, having kickstarted it. I read development logs and kept up with everything, and now that its out I really want to play it, but there's one big problem that no one seems to be mentioning. This game runs awfully. I am well above the system requirements (i have a 760 3gb and a i7 920), and I cant get it above 60 in the outdoor areas (I get high 30's on high, high 20's on low, and yes those are the only 2 settings). This world is beautifully animated and textured, but it doesn't seem like it should chug a system that runs most games at medium high setting at 60 no problem.(see edit) Also, I haven't played through the entire game, really just that starting area, but the dialogue system is really strange at times. It isn't always clear what will end the conversation, and certain choices are way to similar. Edit: The developer contacted me and has been trying to help me fix what might be wrong. I'm still not getting a solid 60 outside even on low, but its improved. The developers have been fantastic in working with me, so top marks on that. Apparently more granular settings are coming and Ill update when that happens."
433600,A Legend of Luca,"I just didnt like it. You just move from room to room, with no rhyme or reason, then kill whats in the room and move on. It's a simple boring asset flip. It kind of like the dungeons in the old school Zelda, but in VR with bad controls, crap weapons, and little variation. VR game devs really need to step it up (sad face)."

433790,Wooden Floor 2 - Resurrection,"short, not very good at the 'horror' aspect or any real 'story' to speak off. The puzles are super easy.  The first one wasn't great but it was better than this garbage.  and the want £4+ for it?? (I got mine in a humble bundle) not worth the money. music was alright.  "

433850,Z1 Battle Royale, Early Access Review
433910,Neon Drive,"Well it's past time I talked about this game, I don't tend to make reviews for any game if duch games ain't really clocking more hours than they should, but if I spent 55+ hours as steam states, then damn there sure is something this specific gem is doing right (or Im just crazy, either or) As such this game is a cal back to the 80's style of sci-fy in a way, with allthe neons everywhere and the whole TRON vibe, also the names of some levels being references them'self, because yeah even though each of the 7 levels not showing any name alone, the music that follows, and also guides, each one has a name referencing things from blade runner to miami vice (the miami vice reference Im not so sure) making people that even never heard of those before still enjoy since none of the references are never too intrusive; A killer soundtrack helps you guide your ever changing machine across each level with a similar begin but tottaly different end, you may always start as a car in a little guitar hero meets hot wheels, but get ready for some odd stuff at every second half; Being a Rhytm game it goes slghtly out of the norm with the music not providing notes that you may follow, but obstacles that you should avoid as if dancing to the beat, so my recomendation when playing isn't to follow the beat as a guideline, but more of a timing pacer, telling you the speed of the beat you must follow. Now that the game received it's latest update adding the very fancy 'freemode' and improved graphics, you can play for the challenge or relax and enjoy the marvelous visuals, with a hard to miss aesthetic, This game may not be to everyone since it's dificulty curve can be kinda wonky from level to level, all counting with both your expertise with arcade-like games and past experiences with rithm based games, but if you feel like up for the meaty challenge and gorgeous art designe I can't recomend enough this game, Also... buy the soundtrack, if you buy the game you will feel like a fool not for buying it.  For the resume, if you enjoy neon like visuals reminiscing of TRON and the 80's most glorious period of sci-fy visuals, plus a very amaing eletronic soundtrack that would be very fitting (even if a bit unfair) to call a daft punk homage, then buy this game and get ready to lose the track of time as you trave in the front seat of each car in this retro wonder."
433920,Aveyond 4: Shadow of the Mist,"  I've been a huge fan of amaranth game since the first aveyond, Aveyond:Rhen's Quest.I have played all of them and suprisingly was very interesting but a bit unsastifying for some of the chapters.The game is fun and well written but it was too short.It was definetly not worthy of price if you ask me :/"

433950,Bit Blaster XL,Super fun!  The fast paced arcade game play is great! I look forward to more games from this developer!
433960,Shadow Of Nebula, Early Access Review
434000,Paws,"Note: This is mostly my opinion. Don't down vote my review just because I wasn't satisfied with this game. Although, I highly recommend you read other negative reviews because they speak the truth.  I was highly disappointed by this 'game'. It wasn't really a game, it was more of a story.  Pros:  -The story is good. A nice and cheerful beginning with your family and a happy ending.  -Wonderful music.  -Left click and you hear the most adorable sound ever.  -A lot of collectibles and secrets.  Cons:  -If you're planning on buying this game, make sure you have a controller. The keyboard controls take time getting used to, but you have to fight the camera constantly with a mouse.  -Not a great ending. It is a happy ending, but this one isn't intimidating and it fell too short.  -The game needs more story. I completed the game within an hour. I was very disappointed by this. The other Shelter games were 2 hours long. It shouldn't cost as much as Shelter 2. Best to get it on sale, if you wish to play it.  -Your   bear friend   is glitchy. Sometimes it'll crash my game.  -It's not even a game. It's a short story where you just solve boring puzzles to   find your Mother.    You may be wondering why I played this game so much even though I hated it. Well, I have a few reasons for this.  1. I like to follow the story of Inna 2. I like to get all of the achievements (although, I do have all of them) 3. It's a great way to kill some time 4. It prepares me to get ready for Meadow"
434020,Last Hope - Tower Defense,"Super easy... Ok graphics.... crappy controls.... BORING! I have played tons of TD games and this one lost my interest quick! I swear I use to go off reviews deciding what to buy, but anymore it seems like they pay for or post positive reviews themselves."

434050,Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour,"Bought it for the new episode but went through all the episodes again!  Spaceport, Raw meat are kinda laggy But babeland is so broken with the framerate it's literally unplayable.| Real shame! Great game but it really needs to be fixed"
434070,Plight of the Zombie,"As my 666th game, Plight of the Zombie is ok :)"
434120,To Burn in Memory,"It took a while for me to get into this game. The first chunk of time I spent on it left me awfully stuck, and I had quite a few moments where everything felt hopeless and I didn't know what to do. I ended up consulting a walkthrough to get me back on the right track. But once I got on that track, it felt like everything fell into place really nicely.  I think one of my biggest qualms with this game was that it was incredibly difficult to get a feel for the arrangement of the different locations. I found myself constantly wandering back and forth between areas because I just didn't know what options led me where. I think this game would have really, really benefited from a map feature. Just to be able to clearly visualize how the different areas were connected would have probably solved all of my issues.  That being said, the prose in this game is lovely, and the ending made it worth it for me. Even after I got stuck a lot, the way the plot worked out in the end was really satisfying from a storytelling point of view. 7/10 from me.  (A side note--maybe a glitch? Every time I exited out of the game, I had to recollect all the items I previously collected. They were lit up in my inventory, but I had to physically go back to the places I found them and go through the dialogue to collect them again. I thought the game automatically saved, and even though when I restarted it, it put me where I left off, the items I had needed to be collected again. Strange.)"
434130,Witch & Hero（魔女と勇者）,"Best love story I've seen in video games.  A bit expensive for the amount of content, but come on, you can afford it."
434170,The Jackbox Party Pack 3,"Played it 6 days in a row. These games are loved by everyone we've played them with, and are so easy to jump into on the fly. Highly recommend. Dave really likes some of these."
434210,It's Spring Again,A very simple childrens game with a great art style and overall high quality presentation. Bonus: You can beat the game and get all 4 acheivments in 10 minutes! :)
434220,Bear Haven Nights,"Even though from the trailer it doesn't look that scary, I felt pretty scared on the first night while playing. The mechanics of the game are interesting since you're avoiding of being detected when you see teddy bears are coming to kill you. But why teddy bears? I know that the game is called Bear Haven Nights, but why do teddy bears sort of haunt the place and want to murder you?  I'm on the second night and I will try to see what happends after a few nights... if I stop being a cry baby XD"
434230,Fairies vs. Darklings: Arcane Edition,"A charming game and with some interesting concepts, but the tempo feels absolutely sluggish. Everything feels glacially slow. One other nitpick is that you can only swap neighbouring gems - I'm more used to match-3 games that allow you to swap a gem with another one anywhere in the same row and column.  As both of these points are very subjective and minor, I still give the game a thumbs up. You can see the amount of work that went into creating it and it might be fine as is for kids or players who don't mind the two things I mentioned."
434240,Alien Blitz, Early Access Review
434250,Masked Shooters 2,"Free for all deathmatch generator with small variety of weapons provided upon spawn. Easy achievements and trading cards. Completion in around an hour or less. Each round is around 6-8 minutes long, so shoot to your heart's content. If you don't mind the simplicity of the game, block graphics, small amount of players playing, three maps to choose from, this is the game to get especially if it was priced at ten cents on discount."
434260,My Name is Mayo,"I don't like the theme at all, its just unapeeling, give it a more modern theme with mayo and it might be good, but not an old timey theme, just doesnt satisfy."
434270,Parasite,"Even with its low price, the game is still an 'almost' that really falls on the 'no' side. Music is somewhat catchy but extremely short loops, scrolling isn't smooth despite the serious hardware I'm running on, and difficulty is more a function of distance from a save point than any other factor. It's tough to rate the central morphing mechanic, as the game regularly provides multiple paths suitable to more than one morph (and a few optional spots that you need two morphs in quick succession), yet in practice you'll end up playing in one particular morph without switching (given that the game wants you to try to avoid switching). Overall, sadly cannot recommend."
434290,Typefighters (Steam Edition),"Interesting and really simple game... makes typing fun honestly (i'm a writer though I already type for fun but you get my point)   The only thing though is it's not truly multiplayer... I mean... you're playing against a computer whose difficulty you can adjust accordingly but it does get boring... pretty fast.   It's not worth $1.99 in all honesty. Just isn't. There are different 'game' options but I feel this would me more for students to test their typing skills. That's the ultimate use I see for it.   But I mean, it's a good game. Try it out."

434480,Mathoria: It All Adds Up,"I played this for a little over an hour and got to the end. While not the intended audience (children), I enjoyed it and would probably play it with young relatives to help them practice math. In this version, there is only addition so I would like to see more games to cover subtraction, multiplication, division and also a continuation of the story line to see what happens."

434520,Simutrans,"Incredible game. Played it for along time before it was on steam, will continue to do so. While other games such as Train Fever have better graphics, Simutrans is the best game I for simulating a large transport system, with other people having done thing like model the entire UK passenger rail network to timetable."
434530,Flobe, Early Access Review
434540,Secret of the Pendulum,"-Short Review-  + Pros:  *Good art style   - Cons:  *Glitched / poorly orchestrated puzzles  *Repetitive back-tracking  *More HOG scenes than puzzles  *Slow hint/skip system  *Short gameplay  **Overall: Don't buy this game unless it's on sale and you're really curious to try it. But, you're better off trying some other HOG games.   + . + . + . + .  I was one of the folks who supported this game on Greenlight, and I was really rooting for it - but it turned out to be an almost complete disaster.   I do like the art style and the concept of two sisters traveling in time (in short bursts, mind you), and the pendant that provides time-traveling powers is a cool gimmick. But that's a drop in the bucket, I'm sad to say...  A number of the puzzles are broken, and at times I either had to wait until the 'skip' bar filled up (took about two minutes) or reboot the game if the puzzle becomes unresponsive.     There was a puzzle in the subway where I had to line up the circuit lines in the power core and it just disappeared altogether. Secondly, I was trying to organize a set of colored USB sticks to get a security passcode - saved my game and exited for a break, and came back to see that the puzzle not only restarted but it was also stuck in the intro phase of the puzzle and I couldn't even get the sticks to light up and get the code - I had to reboot again to get past it. Also, the fuse puzzle on the safe was frustrating because I had to use a combination of four symbols without them touching - in the same columns or diagonally - and it's near impossible to solve. It's incredibly frustrating to experience.    The puzzles and HOG scenes are the meat of the game, and since they're pretty much broken the game is rendered pointless and frustrating - you'd really have to go out of your way to get it working.  Also, the story itself is another issue I have.  It's rushed, and there was a lot of potential to have it go in another direction but I guess the devs were strapped. And there were some interesting additional characters (like a sooth-saying homeless man and a detective with a mysterious past); they only appear once in the story and it's such a waste to cast their roles aside.    The homeless man acted like he knew about the secrets of the pendulum Lily and Madison had, and it seemed as if he could've been part of a secret society, but he's never seen again after that initial meeting. Also, the detective would've added some more depth - and length - to the story, but again, he was dropped after the first encounter. There just wasn't, ironically, enough time to flesh them out in the game.    The story was short, choppy, and the ending - while ending on a happy note - it's unsatifying...  I had really hoped that this would be an enjoyable experience, but I just wasted $8 and five hours of my time trying to get past tiresome glitches. There's no excuse for such a poor performance."
434570,Blood and Bacon,"Rating : 9.5/10   A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y H-A-L-A-L   Pure killing and bacon grilling.  If one is able to look past the dated graphics and plays futher than Day 20, ♥♥♥♥ starts get interesting."
434620,Pythagoria,"Solved all 60 puzzles in one session, about 2 hours (and a small break), with some simple equations and/or 'educated guesses'. Made 3 or 4 errors inadvertently.   - Random uneven difficulty - from instantaneous to tedious fraction equations writing and solving with a badly implemented pencil.  - Does not teach, only check your knowledge.  - No complexity setting.  - No replay value.  Only good as a geometry problems collection for like 5-6 grade's schooler with a couple of Steam achievements."
434650,Lost Castle,Like a coop rogue legacy....great game.
434680,Lamia's Game Room,i wish this was mutiplayer
434700,FORGOTTEN BALL,"Failed to realise this game is way too deep. Literally! I had to take a leap of faith, which leads me to free falling for next few minutes! Even saw some titles, music guy is cool doe! And eventually when I landed somewhere, I wasn't able to move or jump!  Prolly, you might download the soundtrack, that's all! But game is bad, better play C.U.B.E (pretty old, but anyway)"
434730,Half dead,Fun just with friends
434740,Lichtspeer,"Very silly and fun idea, executed with lots of style. Unfortunately the mouse aiming feels very clunky, which was a deal breaker for me as the levels get more and more frenetic and it's frustrating to die over and over just because it's so hard to aim right. Should they improve this in future patches, I'd definitely recommend the game. Right now, it's a pass for me."
434790,Planet 1138,A very challenging MOBA. I enjoyed playing this game for a good while. I like how each stage gets more challenging and think its pretty good considering the price. I ran into a few glitches but overall it worked fairly good to where I still enjoyed it. I definately recommend this game to any person who wants a different MOBA game to play with for a couple of hours or longer on multiplayer.
434800,The Great Escape,I really enjoy the game. Its not completed yet but i expect it to be really fun when its done :)
434820,Brushwood Buddies,"Brushwood Buddies is crafting and resource management puzzle game that I found to be extremely additive.   I enjoyed the cute style, bobby animation and the plinky, plonky sounds. The music I also enjoyed but found the long gaps without music made the game feela little cold. Each time the music started again, I found myself bopping along and helped my flow with the game.  When you start the tutorial you are given the impression that you will face very little challenge while playing this game. However this impression is very misleading. This game becomes extremely challenging, frustratingly so at times. I found myself walking away from my PC a few times while filled with salt, however I always returned determined to not have it beat me. The end boss was the off the scale tricky, but beating him leaves you with immense satisfaction.  For such a small price you get a lot. Not only the main story/challenge mode, but also a whole host of quick challenge modes, with leaderboards so you can compare your score to others. Medals, achievements and even Steam achievements with cards are available. Such good bang for your buck that I purchased a copy for my friend ^^"

434960,Rolling Gauntlet,"I forced myself to play through this entire game, expecting some challenging puzzles, but there are few to be had. The majority of the challenge and frustration exists due to a fundamentally broken system. The developer’s lack of any replies on the forum just adds to the sense that this was a half attempt at a game that he himself did not think it was worthy of his time to bother playing it through before selling it. Pros:  -Skip level feature. -Working achievements. -Handful of levels are nicely designed with a puzzle to solve. Cons: -Changing the quality setting in the game actually changes the way the ball moves. That’s right - some levels are easier or near impossible based on the set video quality. -Next button at the end of the stage sometimes skips ahead to some random level. I guess that could be a pro for speed-running it. -Using Continue from the main menu takes longer to load the level than selecting it from the level select menu. -The pause menu doesn’t actually pause the game, it just stops the ball’s movement, but then gravity still has an effect and brings it down.  -Closing the pause menu has to be done with the mouse and it moves the camera while doing so. -The camera defaults to a view where the ball is not in full view and you have to readjust the camera every time. -False advertising – the store page claims there are 8 unlockable skins, but these are nowhere to be seen in the game, even after completing all of the levels. -Broken levels. One level in particular, 31, has a rotating staircase that does not allow the player to ever make it to the top. I wasted at least an hour of my time before realizing that it just wasn’t going to happen.  I really wanted to enjoy this game, but not possible in its current state."
434970,That Dam Level redux,"In all the time I wanted this game, I hadn't seen any reviews here...at least 'not in my language', so allow me to chime in even without too much playing time: I'm already enjoying this game enough to recommend it. I thought it looked really cool, and like the visuals, and find no disappointment there. There's some good challenge to the gameplay, it's set up to be difficult. Think 'Super Meat Boy' type gameplay but more colorful...and even with some hair-pulling moments thus far, there's really nothing unfair or overly-frustrating, plus you have PLENTY of choice for difficulty. I think the trailer gives a good idea of what to expect from the game. I'm pretty sure I got the gyst of 'That Dam Level Redux', and at very least can already recommend it!"

435010,Krinkle Krusher,"Fan of the style, but at the moment damage is inconsistent."
435030,Lost Lands: Mahjong,"I originally had this as a recommended game, but I'm a completionist and this game does not allow you to proceed past the quest 'Black Magic'. Some posts suggest you just need to power through but the reality is unless you spend weeks of 1 hour a day or large amounts of cash, you cannot proceed beyond this point. Took the enjoyment out of the game for me."
435040,Incredible Dracula: Chasing Love Collector's Edition,"Game is a casual game, long enough to kill some free time during downloads and if you wait for something. The only negative thing is that you don't have keyboard shorcuts but other than that it was a nice game."
435060,GameLooper,Ok so i'm not a pro to codeing but the one in gamedot is easier to understand the codings there than the actions here idk but the code seems more logic but you know it's ok 7/10
435070,Elansar,"Wholly crap. How bad could this game ACTUALLY get? Coming off of Journey Down I was prepared for a game to be a bit less than that, but wow. This game is just unplayable! Can't get a menu, can't get out, changed my resolution. I had shut my whole computer off just to get out of this craphole. The 80's called, they don't want their games back. Myst is OVER. Move on."
435080,Philia : the Sequel to Elansar,"This game is a direct tie-in to Elansar from a very different perspective. It does seem to be a few degrees harder than Elansar, so if you're looking for more of a challenge than the first game, be prepared. I do recommend that both games be purchased together and played in chronological order.  The music and graphics were nice and the camera and controls feature several upgrades since the previous game. This makes for a smoother experience and enjoyable gameplay.  I haven't beaten it yet but I am excited to know what will happen next, which is the mark of a good game."

435840,The Preposterous Awesomeness of Everything,"  Absolutely one of the worst games I've ever played in my life, without a doubt.  Back in April, a friend of mine told me that she had a game for me that's 'right up my alley', and she sent me this as a gift. I've never heard of this game up until this point, mind you. The first thought on my mind when looking at the title was that the game would be a ridiculous, 'wacky-zaney' game, and the first inkling that would be the case was in the title. But, you can't judge a book by it's cover and all that jazz, so I started the game and the first thing I noticed was the cat, which told me every single thing I needed to know about this game. 'Oh, I get it now, it's a meme game that's going to include internet fads that were funny for maybe five minutes', I thought, as I started a new game.  About 5 seconds after the game actually begins I noticed that the faces looked like they were taken from that TV show Anegal Anaconda, except instead of having no color they had too much color, with certain features being over-exaggerated in size. This continued as I saw other characters, and then noticed one of them, the lunatic, was modeled after PewDiePie. I said when starting the game that it would include 'Memes' and 'Internet Fads', but I wasn't expecting this. Looking at the 'features' of the game on it's Steam Page now, it indeed says 'A cameo appearance from Felix Kjellberg (PewDiePie)', so I guess the game's creator can't say they didn't warn me, but that doesn't explain why, so when I saw Felix I Alt-Tabbed out and looked around online to see if I could find any answers, or to see if that was the only one. The only thing I could really find was a Youtuber named 'TheSwollenGamer' who claimed he was the character with a giant head, although I see almost zero similarities.  After spending about 10 minutes looking for answers I went back to the game, and without going into a huge amount of detail about every single thing that happens, I fully completed the game in just under three hours, and that includes going through every single scenario and finding every (easily found) secret there was, all while getting stuck for about 30 minutes total when trying to solve the games puzzles. After the game's ending where you fall down from your space rocket that burns upon re-entry into the Earth's Atmosphere, unfortunatly killing nobody in the process (Remember, wacky-zaney), the game restarts itself and you can talk to one of the first people you find in the game to get a bit of extra dialogue, where in if the right string of dialogue is chosen the game automatically closes itself, saving me the trouble.  However, as much as I wanted to just be done with this absolutely innane game, I wasn't finished. You see, after playing through the entirety of the game, finding every secret, and reading every piece of dialogue available, and even going so far as to reload saves just to see what all of the dialogue options led to... I got zero achievements. Unfortunately, the game's latest patch at that time made it so achievements would not unlock, so I had to email the game's creator, Joe Richardson, to tell him. In just a few hours, he emailed me back, telling me that he forgot to include the game's 'steam api', and that it should be fixed now, while also saying 'I hope it didn't spoil your fun too much!' Oh no, Joe, the fun was spoiled long before the issue with Achievements. He also included a papercrafty of one of the game's characters 'Anthony', the character with the bulbus head I mentioned earlier. But, I'm getting ahead of myself, and while the fix mentioned did indeed fix achievements, none of the achievements I should have already unlocked (which is to say, all of them) popped up, meaning I had to play through the entire game again and do every single step I already did again. And while my first playthrough took less than three hours, the second playthrough having been able to skip through most of the dialogue and knowing exactly where to go and what to do took me about 15 minutes.  While the problem with achievements is absolutely annoying, it isn't why I dislike the game. That's mostly due to the game itself and how it presents itself. There's buttons on the screen that I don't even remember using; I think you use 'Befuddle' maybe once in the actual story, I faintly remember using 'Pray' and 'Insult' at one point, and I'm almost certain you never have to actually do a backflip. There's one point where there's just a completely random gay bash, which I'm not sure is supposed to show the unintelligence of one of the characters or if that's just what the game's creator thinks is funny, because there's multiple instances of things like that throughout the game. I already know people are going to try to tell me 'That's the point', but that doesn't make the game good. Just because a game is intentionally trying to be a piece of trash, doesn't make the game not be a piece of trash and it doesn't make the game good or funny, in some kind of ironic or hip kind of way. It doesn't change the fact that at it's core the game is just trying way too hard to be funny, as also evidenced with making pop-culture references and how characters talk in general. Had the game been made a few months later, you'd most likely see 'Harambe' in there somewhere. I also know that people are going to try to say I'm wrong by just saying that I don't 'get it', and honestly the game has left such a horrible taste in my mouth, I don't think I want to."
435970,RefRain - prism memories -,"Fantastic game, and my god those bullet patterns are hypnotic. Only negatives in my opinion is the sound effects in places lack punch and the background can be rather simplistic at times. BUT who cares about that when the screen it covered in bullets :)  Recommend it highly. "

436000,Lovely Planet Arcade,"Definitelly not worth the regular price, fun and relaxing though. + You can make improve your reflexes and muscle memory with this game. I recommend in bundle or on sale."
436060,Lolly Joe,the controls are super floaty and imprecise. I got this for a dime or so in a groupees bundle and do not recommend it
436110,Medusa's Labyrinth,Really short but got me a few goosebumps haha
436140,Empire of the Gods,Interesting card game where you trade resources to generate resources and stock some to finish levels. It's fine.
436150,Governor of Poker 3,The best free game
436160,The Panic Room. House of secrets.,"For a free game, it is alright. It definitely tries to get your money, but for a look and find time waster it isn't bad. I generally play this when I am playing Civ 5 with friends to kill time while waiting for other members to go. Just keep in mind, this is a FREE game (at least at the time of this review) and you get what you pay for."
436220,A-10 VR,"Seen Star Trek: The Next Generation? Remember Phaser training simulations? This is basically that.  If you're interesting in improving/maintaining your situational awareness, hand-eye coordination, and reflexes: pay the $4.99 and start blasting things. 10/10.  If you're looking for some kind of story line or something, probably not what you're looking for."
436270,Civil War: 1863,"Looking at the achievements stats, 0,1% of all the players has gotten any achievement for finishing any campaign (there are a handful of different campaigns consisting of 5-8 missions). Now that says something.  First off, the price is 10 Euro for a game that looks and behaves like it was released in the late 90's. There is nothing about the game that can justify to charge even 10 Euro for it. Sound, AI, graphics, game mechanics...all has been done better by games developed almost 20 years ago. The only saving grace the game has is the historical correctness, which I can't judge since I don't really care about that level of detail of the American civil war. Now, if your biggest interest is the battles of the American civil war, then you might find this very interesting.  A pet pevee of mine is also when people can't tell the difference between strategy (which this claims to be) and tactics (which this is all about). Strategy in a game is stuff like recruiting units, carrying over units between missions, developing your army or lands in some direction. Civil War: 1863 doesn't have anything like that, it's merely a selection of set situations on battle maps."

436360,Robo's World: The Zarnok Fortress,Thanks for the game key guys. Love it to Death!!!!!
436390,Prison Run and Gun,Purchased hot guns would have liked to give the games I had to my friends.
436400,Heroes of the Seven Seas," The potential for this game is insane. Seriously. The ship aspect of it is extremely fun. Building your ship, going on missions... omg. When I was in harbor and walking around, talking to the NPCs reminded me of games like FF7 where it was actually fun to see what the natives had to say about certain things. Being able to explore big towns while in port would be amazing.   The 1st person fights are pretty cool too. I would love the addition of a sword so you can pick between shooting people or melee fighting.   If you make this a 20 hour or so game that is sand boxy but also has a ton of side quests and content, this could easily be one of the best VR games.   I want more ships in my pirate armada that I can collect.   I'd like a crew I can customize and gear up. I would also like to be able to gear myself up, like in most RPGs.    I would LOVE IT if you added voice command so you can just YELL at your crew to move the ship... like a real pirate captain would do. Either that or add a head movement, so if you tilt your head left, the ship goes left. Tilt it right and the ship goes right. Other VR games have done this with great success.   The weapon targetting felt good. It got a little crazy when I was also trying to steer the ship, hense the suggestions on alternate ways to move the ship.   The teleport options feels OK. I would like a simple push a button and move forward option. I know this option gives a ton of people motion sickness, but there are also a ton of people who do not experience motion sickness at all, and simply moving through the world feels better for us.   I am very happy with it I just wish it was longer :(  Great job!  /heavy breathing"

436500,Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor,"Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor is a really friggin’ boring game.  I was initially excited to play this game. I expected it to be an open world game where you clean up a town Viscera Cleanup style and get paid. And to be fair you still have an open world that you can clean, but it’s far from enjoyable.  This game reminded me a lot of Starbound’s main game, where it’s just boring running around and fetch questing. Except there’s no gameplay in this game. The only form of gameplay I found was to click things on the ground and burn it. That’s it. There may be some other quests or something to do, but the game did nothing to make me want to play them. Food and “Gendershift” requires money and both function as was to refill separate “hunger” bars, but burning things gives you more than enough money to survive so there’s really no reason for me to do anything else. I didn’t care enough to try to get enough money to leave or anything because getting money and playing the game was SO ♥♥♥♥ING BORING.  Honestly it bothers me more in this game because everything else is great. I love the way the spaceport looks and how vibrant it feels. I love the constant sounds of the city in the background and the chill music. I really wanted to be able to go around and converse with people and get some sort of friends or relations in this game because everything looks so interesting. But there’s literally nothing worthwhile to do with anything in the town.  I guess go ahead and try the game. Play for an hour or so and decide whether or not you like it at that point, because at one hour in you will have had the full experience."

436870,Tank Brawl,"This game is nothing like Battle City - the game it's supposedly based on. This is just a generic tank shooter. It doesn't even have the power ups from the original or the fun level designs. Instead you get to upgrade your tank stats by 1 after every fight, amazing.  Also I have a feeling these other reviews which are praising it are made by the developers or their friends, they don't seem geniune or don't make much sense because this game is absolutely nothing like the original, Battle City  Do not waste your money on this if you think this is like Battle City"
436940,Quar: Battle for Gate 18,"I feel that Quar: Battle for Gate 18 is underrated. This is one of the first games to implement RTS mechanics, and it does that well. I really like that you can scale yourself down so that it feels like you're there."

437020,WITCH-BOT MEGLILO,"This is my first time playing a bullet hell game, and it's great fun. I love the little cutscenes and the adorable dark humour. There's lots of different weapons to try out, and the warp mechanic is easy to use but tricky to master.  The game is pretty tough. I still haven't beaten it on easy, but I am a noob at these sorts of games. My main gripe is that you can't save after each level...I literally just have to beat the final boss, but I have to go through the whole game to get there. It's exhausting. That said, I still keep coming back to it."
437030,MEMENTO,"It's an excellent game with a fantastic story, but it is somewhat... difficult. For there is often neither a lead nor a clue indicating what to do, it took me 4 hours to reach just a normal ending (+1 bad ending). And, the save points are not very obvious, and the conversations cannot be skipped (And the skeleton chase part nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off). Despite all the things I mentioned, it is a terrific game with a touching plot, various routes, rather creative creatures and system. The game was worth the trouble."

437170,The Amazing Adventures of Ash - Afterparty,"'The Amazing Adventures of Ash - Afterparty' is a game developed by Z3roram Studios and developed using the RPG Maker VX engine. The game is a horror-style one if you will, and is mostly puzzle-based but has a few RPG elements to it, such as the casual RPG fighting. The game stars a girl named Ashlee who gets invited to a party, but later needs to escape the house which the party took place, with everyone vanished and unable to help her. Only to discover the shocking truth behind who owns the house, and why souls are present within the house.  I have just beaten the game as I'm writing this review. If you know about the other RPG Maker games 'Witch's House' and 'Five Nights at F***Boy's', you would say gameplay is like a mix between the two (Without the sexual themes of FNaFB, obviously). Most of the game is about solving puzzles within the house, and sometimes you'll come across a monster which you must fight and defeat RPG-style. So this game involves leveling up and gaining new abilities. But it's a bit cheezy how the minor combat feature mixes in with the major aspects.  This game MIGHT also be a 'Choices Matter' type as I have been given feedback from the game after doing a specific set of actions. Such as taking an item only to realize I was accused of stealing it later in the game. But I'm pretty sure these choices don't matter as much as other games like Undertale.  People were complaining that the game was poor for its puzzle solving, how it wasn't as difficult and convolluted as other puzzle games, which kind of make you think logically. But overall, this game is a pass for me. It's the kind of game you would expect from paying $2 for it, like something out of a dollar store.

437340,Toys of War, Early Access Review
437400,SOLRAVEN,"Looking down and seeing a fighter jet below me through the HMD was cool, but the way camera control is taken away during the mission start cut scenes as well as the change in camera during shooting are horribly nauseating and break the good use guidelines for momentum in VR. Potentially a fun game down the track if the issues are resolved."
437420,The Secret Order 3: Ancient Times,"Nice hog, the mc visited place before again before it become ruin"
437520,ZeGame,"Ahh, ZeGame. A very simple; although mind-boggling game made by a great puzzle designer, JesperTheEnd. I would reccomend this game if you are looking for a calming (RAGE INDUCING), eazy (HARD AF) game! The music is calming, the gameplay looks easy; you can make it easy, although you are in for a puzzle ;)  P.S Great design and backgrounds!  A 100% buy on sale, or not."
437530,A Blind Legend,"To sum it up this game is a unique and intense experience... I can't say how it works and feels for someone who isn't able to see but as someone who is used to use all his senses to have all but one taken away is a special experience. You have to really focus during the fight sequences and although they might not be hard or difficult from a mechanical standpoint they get pretty intense. Throughout the game you listen to your daughter for directions, creating a certain feeling of dependency, never more present than during the chases where one wrong step could lead to certain death - and your life is more or less in your daughter's hands and the directions she's giving you.   Some people have criticized the voice acting but I don't think there's anything wrong with it, it's functional and that's the most important aspect in this game. Not some fluff is the selling point here, but a unique experience - and the more you open up to it the more you can take away from 'A Blind Legend'. Add to that point that I was quite surprised by the duration of the campaign this game is well worth the money in my book."
437570,GoNNER,"I like everything this game to offers, but right now I REALLY can't get over the delay on the double jump. I talked to the developer at PAX East and he said that he just wanted to build a game that felt smooth to play. At PAX it felt VERY smooth, but I simply cannot get over the delay on the double jump. It takes from the otherwise silky gameplay, and slows it all down."
437710,Magic Flute,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
437740,Inside: Before Birth,I did pay for this game. This game isn't even finished!!! To pay 3.99 for it is a total rip off. When you get out of the tiny room you can't go any further than a hallway. Everything is horribly glitchy! you stand as tall as a giant and you crouch in a way that feels as though the perspective is what you would be if you were walking normally. What a rip off....
437870,Earth Space Colonies,"the game is rather 'easy' because of it's simplicity. You build something and get x amount of resources / workers. To build it, you need certain materials built by other buildings. It's explained which building provides which resources. So far so good. As a casual game, it would be very fun. But within just a few hours you can complete it. It still is in developement, so I hope they add some other features. Because it is fun and easy. If it remains like this, i would spend only a few $ on it.   Pros: + easy to understand and to learn + fun, casual game + short (if you have a few hours to waste) + just build a lot of factories and workshops. That speeds the game a lot.  Cons: - the tutorial doesn't speak of maintenance engineers. It's in the first comodity you build.  Very important, coes your buildings detoriate over time. - in the crafting screen you see how much items you need and how much you have. - you need to go to a lot of screens / buildings to make just 1 item. (example: build a hotel. You need suits. go to crafting. Oh yeah, rubber comes from other planet, ...) - the asteroid has defence against asteroids, but the 2 planets dont? - if you go from 1 planet to another, the first one pauses. So if you have to produce a hughe quantity of resources, you just have to wait at that planet. You can't go to another planet to kill time.  possible enhancements (for lazy people :)): * More text and info for each material please. Like for the turrets gun / rocket / laser. what's the difference? * More text and info for each worker please. In the housing department you can see the miner guy, but you do not know why you need him. At the left bottom you have an overview of your workers and there you see they automatically mine things. Things that you need to finish the game. * Great you have an overview of your inventory and production. But it would be better if you have both of them in 1 screen. Like: Iron ore 'x' / 'y' (x = amount currently produced, y = amount currently in your storage area). So you could easier see which items you still need. * Same thing for the crafting and personal please. * In the game the relationship between Mars and earth seems so important, but you can't send anything to Earth or ask anything from Earth. That might be something to work on. * You get attacked by another 'company'. Why can't you send attacks / troopers to them? It might extend the time to end the game. * At the first planet (Mars) you do not have all the available space to build on. You have to stay away from ±10% of the borders.  Conclusion: With some extra features and hours to play this could be a great game. For now don't spend too much money on it."
437900,Party Jousting,it's really boring
437920,Tricky Towers,"In my few hours playing Tricky Towers I have mostly played the 'endless puzzle' mode as it is the most similar to Tetris, which is why the game appealled to me. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros - I really like the concept of Tetris with physics. Having to balance the blocks so that they don't fall is the most fun element of this game. - The game looks great and has a nice style.  Cons  - If you make a mistake, it is very difficult to come back from it as the presence of gravity means that all your future blocks will just slide off the misplaced block, unless you manage to create a wall and roof around the misplaced block. - The game creates floating blocks as the puzzle progresses, but these often spawn very close to the laser (which you fail if you surpass). This means that as your tetris blocks start moving faster as the puzzle progresses, sometimes they will hit the floating blocks and instantly fail the game for you. Maybe this is a feature but it seems like more of an annoying fault. - When you rotate a tetris block, it swings around instead of instantly rotating. If you do this anywhere near placed blocks, the block you are holding will instantly drop and will tend to result in a misplace. - The controls aren't amazing. Moving a block downwards, it seems to keep it's momentum after you stop and will usually crash into your tower. I figure they did this for stylistic effect but it ends up just being annoying. Also, trying to nudge a block into sideface crevice, sometimes you will time it right and sometimes you won't, it would be better if it was a little more forgiving on that front. - I'm not really into the spells and random huge blocks of the other game modes.  These cons together mean that you can't make any clever manouvers, and if you make a mistake you will often have to restart. To me this is unlike how a Tetris based game should be, as the clever manouvers and coming back from mistakes are what make the game fun. Otherwise it is just mindless stacking blocks like this game seems to be. It's fun for a while but I find myself just wanting to play normal Tetris.  Suggestions - It would be great if they could fix some of the cons I listed. - Also, having customisable game modes (the player can change options such as removing the floating blocks from puzzle mode etc.)"

438010,PulseCharge,"It has potential to be a good game, but as of now it is not worth buying."
438020,AI: Rampage,Game does not run. Tried several different settings available but the game is a constant black screen.
438030,Dead6hot,Missing Exe? Rename .exe to Deadshot122115. Why you would even bother playing except for cards?
438040,Shakes and Fidget,"It is a well known fact that it is a respectable and rewarding pastime to watch paint dry. Compared to this, it is. In this thing, which can hardly be called a 'game' at all, almost all one does is watching timers go down. One can pay real money to speed those timers up, to the point where you should consider paying money to not have to play this at all. Still, it can be addictive, I played it for much longer than I wanted to, so it essentially is ransomware for your life."

438140,Star Realms,"Game is so much fun I've unloaded so many hours into this already  Pros: - Can buy once and play on all devices (PC and mobile) - Lots of single player content - AI is very challenging!! - So much fun building your deck dynamically  Cons: - UI could use more polish some areas (easy to accidently buy a card you trying to inspect &amp; cannot look at your deck during opponent's turn) - Visual FX covers up the remaining 'authority' after you launch an attack. Can get annoying if you're trying to see the status  Mixed (Pro/Con): - I do not like having to discard my cards (personal preference) but its very common in this genre (deckbuilder). Along these lines, during the campaign some missions will cheese you where the AI already has some cards in his deck (such as the Yellow faction that forces you to discard)"
438160,LILT, Early Access Review
438180,Super Mustache,"Jump, dash, and shoot all map to the controller, but can't map the analog stick or d-pad to movement directions. In other words, the game does not support controllers.  There is no logic in what walls you can jump on and ones you can't.  The level designs often make you take leaps of faith, since the camera doesn't show you what's below you.  I got this in some sort of bundle, otherwise it would have been an immediate refund.  There are better games out there that are free. This game is not even worth $0.99."

438340,Drizzlepath: Genie,"I quite enjoyed the original Drizzlepath as it was beautiful and about the right length. This one switched away from the Cryengine and as such is not as joyous to just look around. It is way too long with very limited changes in scenery (other than either outside or in cave).  But the big killer for me (and this is probably *Spoilers*) but at the beginning you make what appears to be a rudementary choice without any reason to choose one or the other. (or maybe I missed what was supposed to inform that choice). And then when you get to the end you are chastized for taking the 'long path because you thought it would be easy' and then you get what I would consider the 'Lose' ending which is not satisfying at all.  I did end up listening to podcasts while playing/pressing right or left on my controller but even then it was way way too long and I was so desparate for the end that to be told I had done it wrong was just a huge slap in the face. And then the annoyance of 'Try the other path, it's shorter and more rewarding' felt insulting."

438420,Zenith,"It's  The Bards Tale  updated with current pop culture references. Except  The Bards Tale (2004)  even had voice acting in it. I've only played about an hour so far, but I miss the snarky narator, the bard's bad jokes and who can forget singing along with   Beer, Beer, Beer..... . I know voice acting isn't cheap, however if you are going to make a game mocking action RPG's you need voice acting. Oh also where are the contols to turn down (or off) the music. It's not bad BGM it's just too loud over the action effects.  I hope (but sincerely doubt) the come out with a  Deluxe Voice Edition (or DLC) . Preferably free but I would pay a little extra for voice acting. I can't recommend with no individual volume control or voice acting. I will probably still play it though it still seems like fun and with a lot of mockery. P.S. Two warnings; 1. Strong language (f)bombs 2. Bad console port so have your Steam Controller ready."

438600,Soccer Manager,"Well, actually I liked the game, but there are some points I totally disliked. First, I could not make screenshots and I can't get any achievement cards so later I found a similar one but without those flaws. Secondly, the multiplayer got me surprised as I could not figure out how it works and even though I learnt it later I still don't find it interesting. Or perhaps I got it wrong, I liked the single one and I even won some games, yeah it's not that bad."
438640,LEGO® STAR WARS™: The Force Awakens,"If you're a Star Wars fan this one will be a blast.   Pros: Mechanics  Story  Controls  Collectables  Achievements  Jokes  Cons: DLC with VERY little content (Must buy if you want all achievements. Also season pass does not include every DLC!!!!)  Bugs (Random crashes with dx11, connecting Xbox controller, characters freezing/stuck on the roof)   Price is a bit high imo, so look for sale."
438650,Gravity Compass,"Agree with traceyshellito, can be a gorgeous relaxing distraction, even the great Pink Floyd when they wrote their Echoes, Meddle or Atom Heart Mother would have loved this game, incredible for meditation and inspiration. Worth a try with this music:) I would even have added some sort of 'autopilot' mode, where you could just sit and watch, riding from galaxy to galaxy...  The technical side looks good, the images, colors, shapes, effects are beautiful, low on frame rate, very smooth with no stutter. Use it on a standard monitor, no VR yet, but had to struggle a bit because of the default resolution (320x200) way too low, that makes the texts unreadable (using Win10). Everything Ok after setting 1920x1080, but tricky to find the way when texts are unreadable:) Now, I would say what all other comments state also: what's next ?  This is a good conceptual demonstrator for such kind of galactic immersion, but it lacks some sort of story or mission, which is still to invent. Curently, difficult to categorize it as a game, a simulation, a relaxation tool ... or something else ? Let's wait and see what the designers will propose next, but I find it to be a good entertainement driver for the moment."

438820,Hyper Box,"At the moment the concept is great and I think the gameplay and etc. would be extremely enjoyable IF there was some control support, keybinds, and basic options like that. Currently using the up / down / side arrows make it almost impossible and frustrating when the controls don't react as expected.  Overall the game could be great, just needs some more control tuning and some options!   I will review this game in a few weeks again and would love to edit my review.   --------------UPDATE------------------------  That game has improved quite a bit and the game is getting better and better. I still can't recommend this game though until the controls get slightly better. I think the problem is when I am playing this game I expect the controls to be on spot with SMB due to the type of game this is. As they continue to optimizae the controls I will review once again and hopefully in the future I can recommend."
438920,Legends of Callasia,"So I want to start off by saying that this game is an epic game and though it does have some shortcomings it makes up for them in its strengths and in the dedicated development team behind it. Let’s start off with the positives 1. A massive multiplayer map selection with huge amounts of maps from 2-8 players. 2. A diverse group of factions to play from giving much diversity and uniqueness to every game. 3. A fun community with an extremely caring development team that is friendly and responds in good amounts of time. 4. Makes me feel that old might and magic. 5. The diplomacy system in multiplayer mode. 6. Hero units with unique abilities adding more depth to the game. 7. A fun and pun- filled campaign that actually has a lot of surprise twists and turns designed around all playable factions. 8. A game set up that allows for a turn based strategy game to be finished in 1 sitting with up to 8 players and not be rushed 9. A seasonal system in the game that once again adds more depth to strategy. 10. An in game card system that adds to the depth of strategy that also connects to what heroes you have giving all players different options to keep you on your toes and the cards are also linked to the seasons. This also adds more thought into when one would play a card. 11. A rather interesting ranked points system (I love taking the points of others muhahahaha)  There are many more positives of the game but I feel as if these are the key ones for me that make me love this game as I have been searching for a long time for a game with the might and magic feel while at the same time being something new.  Now for the negatives. Though small in comparison to the positives there are some negatives that are in the game; though keep in mind some of these are being worked on by the developers already. 1. Occasional disconnects from the server. Now this wouldn’t be so bad if it were not for the AI that takes over for a turn but we will get to that. (in regard to this one there is a system set up to reconnect to a game you have dc from) 2. The AI unfortunately, in this game makes for a poor opponent as they don’t understand how to use the cards. 3. As a streamer much of my community has expressed a desire to play the 2 unplayable factions in the game (side note – not sure if there is plans for more DLC in the future to remedy this or not) 4. A rather odd set up for joining ranked games 5. Lastly the most unfortunate thing the population the game has is not large enough (I know the developers are working on raising popularity)  It is after considering all of these factors and more as well as playing Legends of Callasia for 143 hours that I recommend this game 110% to all strategy and fantasy lovers try out the demo and if you’re having a rough time finding someone to play add me and I’ll try to set you up LoC is an epic game and I hope you join the fun! "
439190,Stories: The Path of Destinies,"I can see why this game won these awards now. Very well done for an indie game. The characters you get a feel for and the narrator is very funny. A lot of nerd jokes tossed in here, even bloody Star Craft famous qoute too! Even when just screwing around, the Narrator will make a comment or a joke.  Took about 5.5 hours til I got the true ending. It has 24 endings, 1 true ending (aka 25 total), but you only need to do 4 of each 'secrets' to unlock the path to the true ending, which the book will help you after you've learned the truths, will show you which one to choose next time around you go to take (for it won't show you if you haven't tried that path yet).  Pros: -Great Characters (as you learn and feel for them). -Great Narrator (I don't want to ruin some of his jokes, they are well timed/placed). -Great story/idea (I'm not even a fan of steam punk stuff, but found this world &amp; story acceptable, didn't even notice it much). -Multiple paths/story choices to make, leading to different story endings. Be a hero, a good friend?, champion at heart?, love to watch the world burn?, want unlimited power?, your choices. -You cannot run off ledges (for when you have speed upgrade, you do run past stuff at times, I would have died so many times if not for those invisible walls), but you can still throw your enemies off them. -Saves from last loot gathered incase of crash, but still have to redo level. -For deaths, you respawn right before the fight area. -The multiple play throughs now lets you remember, right, bad guys spawn here. -The other swords can unlock faster paths through certain chapter's replay runs, making them not as annoying when looking for the other truths. - You like anthromorphic characters.  Cons: -During fightings when clicking so much you can go after the wrong enemy which may result in your death. -The replaying of certain chapter levels so many times to unlock all the truths (if you want to unlock all 24 false endings). -After the 4th run through, now you're probably just wanting the true ending already, but have to ensure you unlock the other secret before the true ending path opens, instead of getting one of the already unlocked truths again. - You don't like anthromorphic characters.  Neutral: Ground disappearing glitch (just restart the game, sadly you have to play from the begining of the chapter level again. But will say, I noticed the game is a bit chugging when I started it again, so that should have been the hint to just restart it then, for it shouldn't be chugging when starting).   Overall, a enjoyable game defiantly worth it's money and an ending that doesn't bring you MassEffect 3 flash backs (you know what I mean). Better then EA (SimCity 2013 never forget) and some of the new high end games productions with all their bugs, disappointments and DLC/season pass crap which demand like $70+ for a game that you can beat in the same time or less as this game for under $20. Like seriously, you can buy a pizza with that extra cash you just saved. And we all know how much everyone loves pizza. Or other games you could buy too, there's that option as well....  If this game is on sale, defiantly pick it up (for those struggling on cash). For it will be like under $10. This game will give you the same satifaction like eating nice full meal for that $8 sandwich or what ever you enjoy eating for under $10 for lunch. I don't know what floats your tastebud boat, do I look like you parent? No? Stop bothering me, I won't tie your shoe!"

439440,Of Carrots And Blood," ►https://youtu.be/tB9l7ALvCVY  (Check out my video for my full impressions)  Of Carrots and Blood is a weird game. Your character (of which there are 10+ of them) is constantly assaulted by waves of enemies ranging from Mutant Potatoes to shield bearing Ogres. The aim, to protect the giant mutant sentient carrot.. Sold already? Buy it. Otherwise there is 1 single player mode and several multiplayer modes as well. The only down side for me was the lack of single player content apart from the endless monster slaying mode. But remember this was developed by two people! Personally for it's price it's a fun little game that you can't go too wrong by if you love trying to beat everyone else's high score!   (Review Copy provided by dev) "

439700,H1Z1: Test Server,"Don't waste your money on this game!  What started off as a could-have-been fun game ended up being just that: could-have-been fun.  With no progress forward and a landslide of movement in the wrong direction, stay clear of this game.  Greedy, lazy developers have led this trainwreck straight off the tracks. They split the game into two games to double their profit while fixing none of the glaring bugs or tidal wave of hackers.  Once upon a time, you would occasionally get killed questionablly. Now the admins are no longer active in banning people or patching cheats. Almost 50% of the time you are killed through a wall, with a one shot, with someone taking no damage, etc. Admins don't care because now they make double the profits from both their games, and they continue to release crates that cost real money to open.   I hope Daybreak goes out of business.   1/10 would rant again."

439770,The Lost Heir: The Fall of Daria,"100% Recommend this game  My friend (who also has steam) suggested this game to me, at first I was a little hesitant because when it comes to CYOA books, I usually buy the actually paper back, but this was soooo worth it! I have yet to buy book 2 and will purchase it soon!  When my friend told me about this book all he told me about his story was that he was a mage, a good guy, and: 'Don't f*** up in the end like I did... It is VERY depressing'. And so for the whole entire book I was focusing on not screwing up, I spent hours and hours playing this game and focusing on 1: Having good relationships with everyone, (especially Petra... she's my bae &lt;3 xD) I was literally so focused on having good relationships that when I did something that made my lover mad at me, and then when I tried to kiss her she HATED me.... So I restarted the whole book, did all my exact answers up to that point JUST so I am able to get that kiss! Yeah Yeah I was addicted shut up, it is a good book! (PS thats the only time I restarted xD)  Anyway: This book his highly recommended, I've already got plenty of my friends to play it and they fell in love just as quickly as I did. You can be bad, or you can be good. I was a good guy, didn't get a single thing of bad reputation throughout the whole game B) Mostly because the next time I went through the book I named myself Bad@$$ Bruce (Don't know if I'm able to say that stuff so a censorship will just be placed just in case :P) and I was a complete thug and a HUGE D*CK throughout the book, just to see what it was like... Well I had plenty more cash, but not very many friends, and it just wasn't very satisfying in the end :(.   But through all this rambling all I'm trying to say is that this is an amazing story and I recommend in all the way, who needs $3.99 anyway? What're you gonna spend it on a lunchable? Nah how bout this game! Much better idea! And here's some advice that I will pass on: 'Don't f*** up in the end, it's VERY depressing' ;)   All right I hope all have a good time playing! (*-*)/"

439930,Control Craft 2,"This game could have been good. I'm a fan of really stripped down RTS games. For example, I've played many hours of Galcon Fusion. Control Craft 2 has the bones of a game like that, with just a few changes it could be a good game. Unfortunately there are too many things wrong with it in its current form:  --It's short. I played through 3/4 of the available stages in just an hour and a half with no prior experience of the game. --It was ported from a FTP mobile game and still retains many features of that which should have been changed. It still has banner ads in it and lacks a full screen option! --It is poorly documented. I still haven't figured out how to unlock a bunch of major upgrades even though I've almost completed the game. (Technically, I guess I'm not certain they can be unlocked.) This is very frustrating.  So I wouldn't recommend buying this game, not in its current form. That said, my first hour of play was a positive experience. If the developer ever wanted to clean this up for a proper PC release, I'd be interested."

440340,Banzai Escape,"Banzai Escape isn't a good game but it's not that bad either, it feel likes the game maybe has been at first develloped as a mobile game then it was ported as a PC steam game (because of the HUD and all the point and click stuff instead of a proper keyboard binding).    Gameplay :   Banzai Escape is rail shooter where you go from cover to cover and shoot anything that move, it's very simple yet effective but way too easy, sometimes the IAs are so stupid that they reload whitout being covered, also when you change cover, they continue to shoot the cover where you were instead of where you are. Also the only real threat are explosives, and being short on ammo (you can buy more ammo for your weapon so buy a lot if you want to finish most of the mission). I mean, the explosives are the only thing that can really kill you quikly, and if you waste all your ammo you lose. Now lets talk about the controls : you can move the character by yourself since it's a rail shooter, you can only make her move from one cover to another and make her aim or not. Also you can't swap between your pistol and your main weapon, so sometimes you are contraint to finish your mission and the boss with your pistol instead of killing the small fries with the pistol. The last bad point is the laser part : there is a mission where you have to dodge some lasers, the partern are very easy to gasp but the control are terrible : you have to use your mouse to move Rokiahi and that's just painfull to do, that's where you can see it's a mobile game : maybe it's easy to do with a touch screen but on pc it would be way better if it was controlled by the keyboard. One last thing : do not play the game with the heavy rifle, it's way too easy with that weapon, because even if you can't shoot with that while being covered, it deals so much damage that you will kill anything before it have the time to do anything.    Art and graphics :   it's very average but I comming from a unity based game I guess it's okay. It's not that ugly, and honestly, it could have been way worse. Also you have character customisation but it's very limited but it's worth to mention.    Sound and musics :   Well, it's nothing exceptional either, the sound design is okay (even if it lack variety but coming from an indie game it's okay) and it even have voice acting (which is pretty bad but they made the effort to do so, so it's a good point). The musics are okay but forgivable.    Story :   That point is confusing, at the start of the game you are just thrown into the action without any intro and you do not really understand why you are here. You only apprehend the story at the end of the game and overall, coming from a game like that, they didn't made a bad job, it's okay (the end is wtf though)    Summary :    Pros : - Voice acting - Funny game if you are bored  Cons : - Can't switch between your pistol and your main weapon - the part where you have to dodge the lasers  55/100 If only steam had a 'balanced' bouton. It's not that bad, nor it's good but it's worth taking a little look into that, yet I don't recommand you to buy it at full price because it's really short (2H and half)."

440540,Ara Fell: Enhanced Edition,"though the screentshots look decent, the game actually looks quite terrible when you actually play it. it has 2 scaling options: a tiny square box in the center of the screen, where the game looks decent, and actually utilizing your screen, where the game looks like complete garbage. from there we hav the option of adding 'interpolation(bilinear)' which just blurs the entire image so bad its worse than just playing in proper full screen.  the reason for this, and many other issues, is that they are using rpg maker 2003. a VERY outdated version of rpg maker that only the cheapest of cheapskates would waste time or money on at this point.  controls are the generic rpg maker controls because the guy couldnt be bothered to learn how the engine works, and even though scripting has always been 100% possible for every iteration of rpg maker, he claims this one dosent allow it simply because he has no idea how to use the program.  cant tell you how the story gets, because i have standards and if a game dont meet em i return that pile o' crap. this one dosent meet them. i require that in this day and age, a game does not use a 4:3 ratio since NOBODY HAS A 4:3 MONITOR ANYMORE. i require that if there is controller support and its a 2d game, that i can use my d-pad for navigation, as the joystick only ends up making you go places you dont want to go.  this is another case of somebody with next to no knowledge of a heavilly outdated engine (any rpg maker) pumping out some cheap bunch of barely any effort."
440550,RunGunJumpGun,Very fun and unforgiving. The game actually started at a faster speed than normal on my first play and I thought it was impossible. Changing it to window mode fixed it though.
440630,The Brookhaven Experiment,"WoW, I could only stand playing this game for 5 minutes, the machete melee mechanic sucks, I get constant reprojection with my gtx 970, stupid voice saying stuff I dont give a ♥♥♥♥ without any real relevance for the game, I regret pre-ordering this crap, I ended up playing a-10 that I bought for only 2 dollars, what a shame."

440660,Void Vikings, Early Access Review
440730,Survival Zombies The Inverted Evolution, Early Access Review
440740,Tap Tap Legions - Epic battles within 5 seconds!,3/10 its not a good game try it you will see why                                                                                              
440750,Story of a Cube,"The game's primary source of difficulty seems to be the inaccuracy of your weapons. A lot of needless backtracking through cleared map sections could have been avoided with marginally better level design. Honestly, as top down shooters go, I'd recommend finding another."
440760,Cube Destroyer,"Simple and ingenious, yet..."
440790,Spellbind,This game is OK but the puzzles don't make much sense and it keeps freezing on me so I have to start again from the beginning. A bit frustrating once you've already got quite far.
440870,Mysteries of the Past: Shadow of the Daemon Collector's Edition,"Meh. It is OK for a HOG, but it is a bit clunky in terms of puzzle mechanics, and the acting is TERRible. I never use hints in HO scenes or puzzles (I do play a lot of HOGs), but with this one, I had to just to figure out what I needed to do. It is trying for different kinds of puzzles, and I do appreciate that, but mostly this is a miss. If you are itching for a HOG and this is the only option, then hey, if it's on sale, go for it. Otherwise, I would move on. FYI, if the game is not properly full-screening for you, you should still be able to select options and then switch off the full screen mode. Your screen will flicker a bit, but for me, it all came back in just fine."
440880,The Count Lucanor,I thought this game was going to be like Undertale. It was not. You don't have many choices to make and they barely matter anyways. There are two main endings with minor variations that are very bland. The story is entirely forgettable. The music is not very good. The 6 hours I played it was not worth $10. There are enemies that are annoying to dodge and you can't fight back against them.
44100,Super Laser Racer,"Simple, flashy, retro, arcade style racing game with very little surprises. There are plenty of similar games, you've most certainly played something like it at some point in time and they are still fun. Exceptional game for killing off a few minutes which is perfect for me since i don't usually have time for larger games that require hours of dedication to progress. I totally recommend this game."
441020,Heavenstrike Rivals®,Now that I played it a few hours I can say it's not to bad. It's a basic lane defence game. Story was pretty short but there are alot of events to grind to get decient units. Managed to still enjoy the game without spending real money.
441050,Polandball: Can into Space!,"Heres my review on this, great yet lazy attempt at a game.  PROS"
441230,Babel: Tower to the Gods,   Early Access Review
441250,Talewind,Really gorgeous looking in fact its probably prettier than Rayman Origins in a lot of places. Unfortunately it has pretty poor performance for a 2d platformer. My rig can run pretty much every 2d game I try on it including Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends but it really stuttered here which kindof ruined things for me. Controls are a little wierd too. 6/10
441350,Assault Suit Leynos,"  Pros:  +nice stylized graphics +decent singleplayer +nice bonus content to unlock +nice customization of your robot, from weapons to armor and movement upgrades (you do have to choose between heavier firepower and having more armor, so I think that's a cool tradeoff) +classic mode for those fellas nostalgic for the original version +music is pretty tight. It's got that Gundam feel to it.  Cons:  -I get alot of slowdown during the game for some reason, even though I meet the system requirements. -kinda easy, I can punch and shoot my way through even the bosses  I recommend this game, and I got it as a gift from a friend. So I'll be checking the 'received this product for free' button. Thanks for the game bro!"
441380,PAC-MAN™ CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION 2,I am certain this game was inspired by heavy drug use!!!
441550,STAR WARS™ Rebellion,Chewbacca was force sensitive. Trained him to master. Anyone he tried to abduct he ended up killing in cold blood.  10/10
441670,Jelly Killer,"Oldschool inspired platrofm puzzler where you play the role of an experimental sentient bio-weapon that can take control of humans, on it's quest to escape the high security facility in which it is contained. The different humans abilities make up the puzzle portion of the game, with five types: Scientists, who can jump high (because nerds are well known for their athletic ability), Engineers, who can move boxes, Soldiers who can shoot, Jetpack guys, who can double jump, and finally Generals, who can open doors. Be sure to posses them in the right order, because they die when you leave their bodies.   This game has 54 areas. Now 54 levels may sound like a lot, but I completed this game in under 2 hours on easy mode and under 2.5 hours on hard mode.  Obstacles such as guns, lasers and crushers seem to have random timing. Which can make avoiding them more of an excersise in luck than skill. And the game designers have no problems placing some of these obstacles outside of your viewable area, even with the ability to scroll the view up and down. So you'll probably need a few goes on the later levels dying stupid unfair deaths, until you've located and remembered all the traps. Hard mode will have you cursing the level design quite a bit.  On the plus side it's very well presented, with a pleasing scanlines effect on the graphics.  Overall I'd have to give this game a 6.9 out of 10. I had a little bit of fun with it, but a lot of frustration. I can't really recommend it."
441680,Obscuritas,Well from thumbnails it looks a good game but you move around using left mouse plus wasd and its not easy to control plus you cant autosave you have to continue the game till it saves the game and after 10 minutes gaming it still hadnt saved and went back to the beginning again so looks like 15 quid wasted
441770,MindTex 2,"This used to be a really handy multitexturing map generator tool that was very helpful and fast especially for game development stuff.  However, in it's current state not working on Windows 10 on my end at this point I cannot recommend it until the problem is fully resolved and I do not recommend buying it at least until I know and can verify it's working 100% again.  It has forced me to use Mindtex 1 which is okay but not as good nor as finetuned and also leaving me looking for other affordable or free alternatives for the time being which is extremely upsetting."
441790,Fragmented, Early Access Review
441870,OutDrive,"This game is fun, but not $3 fun, If you get a coupon like I did then get it."
441920,Dovetail Games Flight School,"Not at all up to expectations as a new gen flight sim. I did like the flight sim reality of landing coming in slow and steady lining up the runway correctly to land. It did feel good...real good but as for the graphics, well what a let down. The background mountians are a strang silvery colour staight out off a Bramuda Triangle movie and I could not see the difference in ocean colour and land mass colour. Both being a hazy light green pastel shade of colour. My city of choice was no better than the old MSFS 2004 version with the airport control tower being the old tower that was around in 2004. I expected a bit more in 2016 but it's growing on me. I will return to my favourite flight sim MSFS-X still rated as the worlds best to study more. Flight School must be in beta format still so we will wait to see what happens when improvement changes come into play. Could be the makings of a dame good flight sim. Keep up the good work Dovetail and make a converter of me.......................well update 6 (July 2016) has destroyed my game, unable to fly at all. this is not making a converter of me."
4420,Silverfall,While browsing the games on sale i spied this old game and decided to give it a go. After a rough start with the controls i have come to love playing it! So i would say give it a try if you want to add to your library!! There is an issue with it requiring an old version of PhysX but theres a link at the head of the forum to fix it! It basically drops a folder inside your current physx files and it plays flawlessly afterward!!
442000,Alone K.W.,♥♥♥♥ing had trouble loading 3 times and its boring good thing it was just a dollar
442070,Drawful 2,This version of the game does not only have new prompts and a mode where you can make your own episodes but it also has TWO COLORS!! Amazing.
442080,Riders of Icarus,It's not a bad game just not a great game. Like the graphics and responsiveness of the cry engine is awesome. but not being able to choose my skills and not really have a skill tree to view or utilize is kinda redundant. It doesn't allow for any originality. All players are basically built the second and you spend hours grinding to get levels to do raids that are almost to hard to complete. But if you want a game where you don't really have to try to play it this is the game for you.
442140,Dyadic,"Excellent puzzles and beautiful artstyle, directed by a 10/10 would bang human being. Have heard he is a handsome dragon."
442190,Mind Dead," https://youtu.be/h1Wm_Uv8Lv0  If you have a few extra bucks laying around then why not. It runs smooth, hit detection is good, simple story. Why not give it a try. This has potential add some coop or make a more survival/crafting game with the base mechanics they have made here could be fun.  For the time being I recommend the game."
442210,Switchcars, Early Access Review
442220,Iron Madness, Early Access Review
442260,Sprinter,"This is an addictive, challenging runner game that features lightning quick retries. Basically this game has no learning curve at all and it is so unforgiving that I even had to retry the basic tutorial stages a few times!  If you like those kind of hard games, go for it. Personally I prefer an easy start to get used to the controls before the difficulty ramps up! Don't plan to play it again even though there is an easy mode!"
442290,Pointless,This game is fun and good time waster but the dots are too small. Even smaller than my ♥♥♥♥.
442500,Age of Gladiators,"I love Gladiators. I don't very much care for this game.  1. Fights take too long and they are just simulated. 2. Money is how you have to keep things going. You can't earn enough to keep your stable going. 3. You don't know who you are going to fight and loses always end in death unless you waste develepment points to keep them alive. You will need to be level 6 to have 100% to keep them alive. With that they get nothing extra. Just a chance to live. 4. Perks are silly and way over balanced. 5. You pay everyone each day. EVERY ONE. You own the fighters. Why are you paying for them? The staff is also paid every day which is expensive.  The games needs to be fixed. I've tried many different ways to start playing. Owning a very small amount of fighters lets you to have your money last longer but with a small amount of fighters they get hurt and can't fight. You of course pay for EVERYONE and lose big money.  I lasted a good amount of time by borrowing money and then betting it on one fight. I paid back the loan and did very well in the first city. Until I got to the last Boss. He had an average of level 6 fighters. At this time I had 5 fighters that cost a good amount. They died one at a time to this last boss. WIth not many fights, I watched my money go to nothing. Then was left with only a few fighters at level 2. Game over because I lost them shortly and was in the hole again. You can't buy experinced fighters from the recruits and buying fighters from bosses is too expensive.  $10 lost. I could have went to see a movie!"
442710,Fantasy Tales Online,   Early Access Review
442760,Endless Burst,"  Endless Burst has the pieces for a pretty good Bullet Hell Shooter. But it's missing some variety and clarity for the classes to really be good. Things ramp up a bit too quickly and the starting class I got 'Tempest' that requires you to be in close proximity doesn't mesh with my play style at all. Which made it difficult to progress and unlock new ships. It might be better if you can choose your starting class when you first start, then mix and match the stats as you go.   Overall its ok.   Heres a preview video that I created for it:  https://youtu.be/tgR0d2ioY7k "
442810,UFO Online: Invasion,"Great game, it seems like little at begining but there are actually many things to do , quests , missions, scan with drones , mining and more , lots of skills to improve etc .. It is not pay to win , and you can even buy Gold with ingame currency. Game has been updated and there are now more secure areas within the so called farming zones , were player have to venture in hostile to get what they need. Just remember this game is PVP so when you hit lvl 9-10 and start going into hostile zones you will need a clan to help you when you get attacked by player of your lvl but with high end gear and skills ... dont worry they can be killed just like you :)  "
442890,Magic Potion Explorer,Well first off its not a clicker. Its just a upgrade idle game ...2nd Its so short you can play free games else where with more content than this. Its amusing for about two hours when you max everything and just let it run to the end. Less if you have played idle games. Has 0 replay insentive other than to get a s rank and it starts you all over to do this not worth the price at all when compared to what you can play for free even here on steam.
443020,Victory and Glory: Napoleon,Not worth the money honestly could be a board game sadly.
443070,Insane Insects: The Inception,"By far one of the worst games on Steam.  I got this turkey in a bundle so can't refund on it otherwise I would have. My sincere condolencies to anyone unfortunate enough to have actually bought it.  Essentially It's single player only FPS arena shooter made in UDK. 1v1 against another bug using the most pathetic weapons imaginable, in a woefully featureless, poorly constructed arena.  The video isn't representative of the game.  There are talented and dedicated coders out there who have made UKD sing like a nightingale that just discovered it had won the Euromillions. Badcast Games isn't one of them. It takes considerable effort to make a UDK game this crap.  It does EVERYTHING wrong.   Gameplay, graphics, sound.... f@cking EVERYTHING.  To have the brass neck to upload this onto Gamejolt would take a skin as thick as a rhino. To ask ANY money for this garbage is an affront against gamers but to ask £6.99 is nothing short of a borderline crime against humanity.  Shame on you Badcast Games. At what point did you look at yourself in the mirror and say, job well done, lets put this out for commercial sale ?  This should now be the new meme for p@ss poor FPS games....  I've seen some crap on Steam recently but usually you can see the spark of a good idea or some vaguely redeeming feature despite the poor implementation but this is just annoyingly, willfully, f@cking terrible."
443080,Elite Dangerous: Arena,Rubbish. Never been able to enter a game. Just left waiting in the lobby 
443330,Malus Code,"Tokyo school life is the only good one. I haven't finished this but the cringe is real plus there's a gee asab trap. Fully voiced characters with good soundtrack tho. Hard to read, not sure if that's just me or not"
443360,Red Comrades 2: For the Great Justice. Reloaded,played this a lot back then awesome game :3
443370,The Treasures of Montezuma 5,"Good Game on sale, very similar to previous games. As you progress you are earning crystals to upgrade totem powers and brick powers, additionaly you are getting tokens to gamble - where you can win more crystals. Good old match 3."
443380,Tokyo Babel,"Awsome visual novel, superb atr style and chracter design.Lots of story paths and as overal super game."
44340,Operation Flashpoint: Red River,"Very realistic war simulation  Its a shame that Codemasters stopped working on their Operation Flashpoint titles. I realy enjoyed playing them. I guess I was in a minority in this case?  You play as one of a squad of 4 poeple with a mission to take out a group of insurgents. Mostly you are on foot. Your team is semi-autonomous, they follow your orders but are not controlled by you in any other way. If you put them in danger, they will get killed, and so will you! In fact you can be killed by a single well aimed enemy shot. Thats why I call it realistic. Having played some other 1ps recently and emptied a whole clip into an enemy without even slowing them down this is refreshingly realistic."
443420,Artificial Defense,"I'm not sure what to say other than it's a really good game, and 'HERB STOP PUTTING YOUR USB IN MY COMPUTER'"
443450,LASTFIGHT,"This game is quite decent and well made, its a fast and fun brawler that plays rather well and it is one of very few of this species in the market right now, the characters are quite loveable and the music is on the spot for the action. The only downsides is that it lacks content and is quite short, I really hoped it would have more stuff to be the closest to Power Stone as possible... Well let's hope for a big sequel or expansion-update.  Wot I wish for: Larger maps with envinronment modifiers like in Power Stone. Individual character transformations. Tons of items and unlockables. More characters. Bosses in campaign mode. Multiplayer in said campaign mode.  The genre extreme has potential, please explore it, there is even space for competitive gaming, imo."
443460,Star Sky 2,Boring
44350,GRID 2,"Bought on sale after loving GRID I was hoping for something good but came away disappointed.   The cars and graphics are nice enough. Now on the bad bits. The menu system is akward and ends up intrusive to the game overall, instead of letting you get the best of it. That could be lived with if it was not for the biggest issue this game has.  It lacks the visceral experience of a RACE compared to the original. This is down to cars feeling unpredictable/non linear in their behaviour.   During gameplay there is an unmistakable feeling of driving aids being too overpowering. They don't make the game fun by taking care of a the odd blunder, they smother it sadly.   All of the above was evident from the first few minutes of gameplay, I persevered for the sake of the game for 6 hours of total gameplay. In the end I am sad to say this is a game you should 100% avoid if you want a fun and thrilling racing experience. This is not on a sim or arcade spectrum. The core gameplay just does not work here...   The original GRID left me thrilled, this just furstrated"
443530,Adam and Eve: The Game - Chapter 1,i could not face the boss chapter 1
443570,DreamBreak,"I would recommend it at a sale price. I enjoyed it mostly due to the visuals and charming old school vibe. It's a short game with a weak story and easy puzzles, but it has a cool style to it and it was enjoyable to play through for me. Some of the vehicle sections had me chuckling a bit, because it felt so nostalgic. Sale price for sure though."
443580,Antenna,"I played this game because the visuals looked like Limbo. (And it was a Indie game so I thought I would give it a try.) When I started the game I didn't know what the heck was I doing so it took like 10 minutes to figure it out.Other than that I liked that the puzzles are based on audio so you have to listen carefully to understand. Oh, and I generally play games with headphones so if you're like me you definitely should turn the volume down before you play.You can thank me later. Sooo, yeah.When I finished it, it was like done &amp; gone.Was there supposed to be a story behind it or a meaningful message or something? If it was,well I'm stupid for not getting it. But this is not my type of game."
443630,Chicku,"This game is quite fun but after awhile the fun wears off. In truth the developers in my own opinion were ‘lazy’ granted I understand the vision at first was for a single player then adding in split screen co-op made sense HOWEVER in this day and age and especially uploading to steam the developing team should have considered working in a online multiplayer. If they were to INCLUDE it (see fourms for dev’s mention of possibly adding as dlc or standalone) I see this game staying under the radar of popularity with low sales. Word of advice to the developers, if you wish your game to sale PLEASE include a multiplayer and I GUARANTEE sales will rocket especially when youtube celebs begin playing it. Though time will tell this game is fun and quite entertaining (for a short time) but without a co-op/versus (lan/internet) this game will fall in the to junk pile. Till some sensible multiplayer is implemented I cannot suggest this game to anyone."
443650,Wailing Heights,"I wanted to like the game, I really enjoyed Hector so finding other game the writer(s?) of that worked on seemed like a good idea. But I only managed 2 hours... and as explained later this was only because I was forced to restart the game from the beginning due to a bug.  I liked the visual style of the game, just not anything else about how it was implemented such as the weird walking animation of Soul for example. The game didn't really give me the comic feel I was expecting and at most times the game seemed very condescending with how it blatently tells you 'LIKE' 'LOVE' 'HATE' and all that. I also just couldn't like any of the characters, they just weren't likeable.  I played for a bit, got stuck for half hour trying to find clotted cream, then gave up and searched youtube where they somehow had clotted cream in their inventory without showing me how they got it, so I searched again and it seems I actually hit a bug where if you don't collect the clotted cream and leave the screen it's gone forever.   Despite this I started the game again because I had no saves at that point, collected the cream this time, got merely 5 minutes further and hit another game breaking bug after following a book into what looked like a graveyard at he bottom left of the first area, I got stuck outside of the screen before even entering the gate and gave up.  So in the end I was going to get a refund but didn't, as I want the creators to try harder to fix the bugs and try again in future, but I think they have the aility to come up with good things."
443700,The Inner Sea, Early Access Review
443800,Ruckus Ridge VR Party,"Even if you launch the game in Oculus mode, all the button prompts are for the Vive. Makes it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get a game going because no one knows what button to push."
443810,This Is the Police,"I feel like 180 days is too long. Cut scenes could be shorter. But overall, its a good game"
443830,The Daring Mermaid Expedition,Love this games. I own all of them. :3
443850,Tross,"Good graphics, but you can't even fly around with all the blocks everywhere, too much crashing."
443900,American Powerhaul Train Simulator,i want my mony back this game keeps crashing on me
443970,S2ENGINE HD,"Hmm I really would like to test it out, the graphics look amazing and it would be a perfect start into gamedesigning. Since the update today, I couldn't start it at all. Does someone have the same problem and/or solved it?   Greetings"
443980,Burokku Girls,"Burokku Girls is a rather impressive light ecchi novel. It's got some rather interesting characters framed around a world that may seem cliche on the outside. But deep down the game has a lot of heart. It's true that the game has adult themes and sexual content that is in step and stride with the ecchi genre, but it is also a game that has a lot of heart and drive behind it. These games are not just ecchi focused. Silver Cow Studio wanted to build a world, a universe, something to house their characters. And they put a lot of work into them.  The games are very text heavy, there's a lot to read. But if you put the time and effort into them to enjoy the characters and the worlds for what they are, both this and Time Tenshi are amazing.  There's not much in the choices or gameplay. These are novels with some nice artwork and some interactive animations. A rather nice soundtrack, beautiful backgrounds and some sexy fun.  If you've played Time Tenshi, you'll probably like Burokku Girls. Likewise, if you like this, you'll probably like Time Tenshi. The quality and care between the games are virtually the same.  I support Silver Cow Studio, and hope they continue to make more of these."
444000,Super Night Riders,Enjoyable little throwback nod to classic Sega game Hang-On. Maybe not quite worth the regular $10 asking price but definitely a worthy sale purchase.
444020,Coffee Pot Terrarium,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
444090,Paladins, Early Access Review
444130,Auralux: Constellations,"Multi is dead, the idea is good, I like this type of games, but without multi it doeas not worth the money."
444140,Sonicomi,"This game is awesome! There is so much replayability due to the 18 possible endings, hundreds of costume pieces and designs for said costumes and a fairly simple but addicting form of gameplay.  The fact you can play freely and just take pictures of Sonico in your favourite outfits, add filters etc and save the pictures to your hard drive is a nice added feature too.  On a side note, considering she's the mascot of an audio company and is regularly seen playing a guitar, it's a pity that the game doesn't revolve more around her musical lifestyle.  If you're a fan of Super Sonico you should definately get this, it's well worth the money due to the amount of content it provides."
444160,Bonsai,It's kind of cool growing a tree in all but like I don't have the patience to keep clicking till the tree is fully grown lol.
444180,Techwars Online,Unpolished and unfinished game with not so creative mechanics. Maybe even this all could be overlooked if there were any players online. Playing skirmish is just a waste of time...honestly.
444200,World of Tanks Blitz,Lag lag and more lag. It happens especially with pedals as you'll notice when someone is constantly near you and able to make your tank slowly sink into the ground or continue forward without response. This is made worse by seeing players automatically aim where the nearest enemy tank is and firing at walls! Why would you need an aimbot in a tank game anyways? Couldn't recommend.
444210,Strike Force: Desert Thunder,Big ol' heaping pile of wet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage. 
444220,Asteroid Bounty Hunter,"While I found it graphically ok for a tablet, I found the levels boring. Often there were moments of no spawns and I just really didn't want to keep playing before the hour mark."
444250,Crown and Council,"- UI is a drama and tragedy - There is more luck involved than actual strategy - AI is very stupid. There is no challenge in winning.  - Game is very similiar to Risk, but in my opinion worse - There is no possibility to plan custom maps, only 'campaign'."
444260,Mindless Running,This game is seriously not even worth your money... literally a one botton pressing game.
444270,Hypersensitive Bob,"Game is fun enough and has a nice art style, game plays similar to Binding of Isaac. I feel it does some aspects better, things like the items: their powers, getting them, having a choice at the end of a round if you can afford it, etc.   Pros:   +Easy on the eyes  +Quite easy to learn, yet difficult to master  +Seems to play well without issues  +Decent item variety  +Easy to understand stats (fire rate, damage, crit chance, movement speed, etc nothing cryptic like 'The Ring of Jeshire shall bring you great fortune!' and it really means you gain a little bit of crit chance, but it never says this so you always think you get more money. Or, 'The Hood of Dodongus will take you bowlink with your cousin on tuesdays' who the hell can even guess what stat something like that would bring? Nah, no need to deal with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here. Just SMART items such as 'Surgery: Gain double damage, but lose 1 HP at the start of every round' and (memory is failing me, this probably isn't exact) 'Fireworks: +20% fire rate'.    Cons:  -Game is either a walk in the park, or ball achingly hard. There is no in-between. Pray to RNGeesus and he might deliver unto you.  -Seems like there is never enough in game currency to go around, unless you get a certain item which takes your health down to 1 but gives you money at the start of each round.  -Game is fairly short  -Controls feel somewhat clunky and cumbersome or sluggish, sort of like having play in the steering wheel of your car. You turn it and it doesn't do anything for a half turn, but then eventually the car reacts and it starts to turn. Speed up items fix this feeling of slop, but the game still shouldn't feel so much like a run down $400 beater you bought for winter.   TL;DR: Game is pretty fun, just give it a chance. "

444430,Zeus vs Monsters - Math Game for kids,Hey kids! Use the power of math to hurl spears into the chest of your enemies! EDUCATIONAL!!!  This game also taught me that my girlfriend has math skills roughly equivalent to her 5-year-old son. She doesn't even know what a division symbol means. I told her it means division. She replies 'what's division?'  This game ruined our relationship.
444440,Scapeland,"Don't buy 4/10  This game has a lot of potenital in it's farming aspects. I'm not going to lie the farming is really enjoyable to do, but then the game turns into this ANNOYING stealth game where you are running away from the military. I got so bored i just uninstalled it off my computer, i'm never playing it again. Huge disappointment. :(  PROS  - Farming - Neat artwork  CONS - Everything but farming - When you get caught there is no option to run away or evade (In my opinion really let it down because i would be at the very end of a mission then i would get caught for some dumb reason, then i had to start all over again)"
444460,Love is Blind: Mutants, Early Access Review
444480,Broken Dreams,"Absolute rip off of company of myself with the storyline made worse. Company of myself has a much more depressing ending, but at least it is good."
444520,Leave Me Alone: A Trip To Hell,This game is great! Hardest controls &amp; best enemy's - make this game success for me.
444530,Light Repair Team #4,Classic puzzle game expanded into a virtual environment. Really breathes life into it
444550,Void 21,It's pretty good. A lot like Race the Sun but with the occasional enemy. I bought it on a sale (I think) and it was worth it.
444580,ALONE IN SPACE,"I liked it, finished it in one go. I would love to play another if there is a sequel. The puzzles were fun, and the backstory interesting. What would be cool was if the messages were video files instead of just text."

444690,TRAPPED, Early Access Review
444720,Inexistence,"The platforming is poor, story is almost unnecessary because the gameplay doesn't match, and the three boss battles I've been to so far are ridiculously basic. Maybe I'm expecting too much out of this game, but it really feels like a chore to play.  The title is oddly appropriate though; What's in Inexistence is this games' fun factor."

445040,Sorcery! Part 3,"Game crashed halfway through and all my progress was reset. Then on my second run though I couldn't defeat a serpent THAT WAS TRAPPED IN AN ORB because I chose to learn about countersepells, and it wasn't like the serpent left or anything the only reason I couldn't get the orb at that point was because of lack of forsight from the developers, and even thought that was the ONLY SERPENT LEFT AND THE ORB WAS STILL THERE AND HE WAS TRAPPED IN THERE I got the bad ending for this part. I spent almost two hours trying to find a way to get that orb but there was no in game way to get it without reseting my game AGAIN.  A somewhat fun game completely ruined."
445110,Tasty Planet: Back for Seconds,"This game is really cool. But it is a maximum of 1 hour. Missions do not differ practically nothing. Only the new scenery, models, enemies. All, more games than not attracts. But the game Tasty Blue is really interesting, want to play, unlike this 'masterpiece'. It is not worth 1.5 dollars."
445130,The Average Everyday Adventures of Samantha Browne,"This was actually pretty cute. And I can relate so much about social anxiety and feeling embarassed about doing the simplest of things around people I don't know. Quick, simple and sweet. Who knew making oatmeal could be such a hassle?!"
445140,Smell of Death,"Well, glad I got this for the 80% off price....  In short, terrible. The enemies are a mish-mass of zombies, ice creature...things and spiders etc etc. No real artistic style to any of the enemies. The actual level itself is quite nicely done and fairly varied while interesting as well. Yet the odd choice of 'automatic hands' when near a door handle or item pickup is incredibly awkward to deal with in fights. The AI in these fights is also awkward, clumbsy and terribly animated making them more hilarious than actually scary or a real threat. The fact that 90% of these creatures have no footstep sounds leads to many a cheap attack. The swords are far too brightly aniimated making them more lightsabers than swords, they're also basically useless to use. No feedback to hits, enemies simply walk through and attack you.   All in all, I didn't enjoy anything beyond how hilariously bad some of it was. Like a bad B movie that's so bad it's kinda good..."
445170,The Haunting of Billy Classic,"This game is a side-scroller roguelike title. It's pixel graphcs are nothing too great, but you can at least tell the difference between them. The combat is okay, but the hit detection is the fatal flaw of this game.  I really enjoy everything about this game, but the hit detection feels hit-or-miss and is the only reason why I can't recommend this game. If the hit detection was a little better, then it would be a decent game. However, as it stands, it's just frustrating at times."
445210,Tiny Knight,Clunky. Stiff. Framework issues. Seems like a demo or unfinished. I may ask for refund.

445310,Might & Magic Heroes VII – Trial by Fire,"Not fun, somehow worse than the original games"
445350,Atomic Space Command, Early Access Review
445420,Aselia the Eternal -The Spirit of Eternity Sword-,"Part Fire emblem part Clannad. This game is what set the bar for a great visual novel. The strategy portions of the game actually will effect the outcome of the story, and the interplay of the story and strategy make you pretty invested into the troops. It isn't some generic spirit mook you are fighting with it is the cute and shy Hellion, and knowing about her makes you sad if you can't bring her home safe ;;   The one thing I would say as a complaint is some of the missions are too damn long, which is ok for a pure strategy game but as the whole game is pretty much one long war campaign it seems like the missions that are super long could have been subdivided into smaller tasks with story breaking it up. Now there are some that sorta do that... kinda... but it stays in the strategy mode engine which doesn't let you save when they are talking and only gives the profile icons for people talking so it isn't as immersive as the visual novel mode engine, which has voice acting and quick saving.  Anyway. The game is great. if you like visual novels or strategy games like fireemblem or super robot wars, this is a must."

445750,Settled,"Settled was an interesting game to play through, priced about the same price as a cup of coffee I feel like its worth the money. You will get about 30 minutes of game for the $2 ticket to this experience. It's creepy, atmosperic and weird without being cheesed up with jump scares. Highly recommended for someone looking to kill 30 minutes with some decent story telling and cool atmosphere. Not recommended for people who want to play a game, as this is more like an interactive short film.   3.5/5 download it now!"
445770,Airport Madness 3D,"If you're looking for a realistic ATC simulator, this is NOT it. Completely unrealistic how planes come flying in unapproved and within a second's notice and how airplanes can't use alternative taxiways to leave the runway. Their landing speeds are also unrealistic, which causes accidents with other aircraft."
445840,Undead vs Plants,Just like Angry Bird but with Zombies and Plants and Bouncing Bullets. Great for Kids! Would also work great on mobile devices as well.
4460,City Life 2008,HORRIBLE....i went into the game......it did not let me inside the game at all.
44600,GTR - FIA GT Racing Game,"Can't run it, because game won't ask for cd key.  911/10"
446000,Stellar Monarch,"If you are looking for a true grand strategy game where you manage an empire at a high level of administration this is the game for you! But if you are looking for a more traditional 4x experience be warned you should likely look elsewhere for things like ship designing, control of tactical battles, and general micromanagement. None of those are to be found in Stellar Monarch. This is also a game for people focused on gameplay rather than graphics, although the art style is unique and it has grown on me quite a bit.  Positives:  + You really do feel like a space emperor, setting broad policy goals and trends without getting bogged down in day-to-day management of things like colony buildings and individual starships.  + Era system and interesting events keep you on your toes. Different eras can have pirates being more active, a coalition of major races forming against you, and more. Major events like slumbering alien empires violently awakening and rebellions threatening to split your empire in half challenge you throughout the game.  + Combat is hands-off, but your decisions on how to build your fleets and squadrons, and which officers to use make a big difference.  + Balancing the various political factions in your court is a fun way to play politics in an effort to improve how your empire is running.  Could Use Improvement:  - A proper tutorial would be nice. There are tip screens and such, but it can be hard to grasp everything the game has to offer when you are just clicking around to see what every screen and tab has to offer. Plenty of tooltips are available, but some things are still left unexplained.  - Variation in major/minor races. They all feel pretty much the same to play against. The major ones have a small amount of flavor text to set them apart, but really they have the same tech and play the same. Seeing some variety in how they play, and how you can counter them, would be nice.  - More variety in events. It seems like you get the same diplomatic events every audience no matter the race you are dealing with. Same goes with good/bad events base on your court. This game could benefit a lot from more events to keep it interesting.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase so far and I imagine I'll be spending many more hours with this game!"

446050,Operation KREEP,"When a corporation faces a delicate problem, how do think it solves it? And what if this problem isn't delicate anymore, but it's green, it slurps and it's eating people? Oh, don't hope for 'good' ending, you know what GIANT SPACE CORPORATIONS are like.  The game is a funny puzle with black humour. You and your team land on various space objects and try to eliminate an alien threat. Officially. And unofficially you have some other objectives that are not written in your papers. You know what giant space corporations are like.  Good luck, brave and gready mercenaries! 10/10 kreeps."

446250,Silver Bullet: Prometheus,"What you see is what you get, its an ok game, if you like what u see in the video/pics I recommend u get it but at a discounted price."
446310,Sabres of Infinity,"It's gripping, it's tense, it's above all very-well written, I can't recommend this enough to those of you who like a good old chose-your-own adventure playbook. In this first episode (quite lengthy), you have a wide array of choices ensuring high replayability, and your choices are imported to the second episode (Guns of Infinity). The writing is credible, you can feel the author has researched actual veteran's memories to give an account of war that you can buy into. "
446330,Guns of Infinity,"Great sequel, the path is not evident and clear to beat. My favourite Choice of Games so far."
446380,Sophie's Curse,I've coughed up scarier and more interesting stuff than this.
446390,Onechanbara Z2: Chaos,Well the game isn't as good as i thought it would be with the controls. Also the skill level thing is a bit confusing it seems and i can seem to look it up anywhere yet as to how that works. I have enough yellow orbs to buy the stuff it just won't let me skill up? Not sure what that is about. Also got stuff for the gallery and the gallery didn't open up? Seems to have alot of issues. It's still fun to play anything with hot chicks fighting is cool and this is good enough but wait for a steam sale and don't pay full price for this hopefully they will update this more i got ver. 1.9 and it still has glitches i read about since 1.3 Over all it's ok
446440,Doctor Watson - The Riddle of the Catacombs,how did this end up on steam?  sorry for been mean but this must be have came from someone who is learning to program a game for the first time?  appreciate the efforts but this game is no way worth money nor time to play. not even worth to be on a bundle which i got this game from.  not recommended 0/10

446460,Highland Warriors,This game was at the top of my playlist when It first come out. Unfortunatly it was unplayable when the kids got into my games and lost the Code you need to install the game. I was very happy to see this game on steam and will be playing this game quite a bit again.
446470,New York Taxi Simulator,"I got this in a bundle and, quite honestly, thought it was going to be a lot better. On a first playthrough it's easy to get lost in the different missions and trying to beat your scores and everything but it just turns out to be so freaking boring afterwards. Not worth full price at all."
446480,New York Bus Simulator,Three letters: UIG
446490,Rail Cargo Simulator,"Don't let the 'Mixed' Review fool you. This game isn't worth your money.  The only options menu that this game has is upon startup. You can only change your resolution and play in fullscreen or windowed. This is a pain when the volume level is too loud.   You have absolutely no idea what to do. It gives you sorta instructions, but never tells you in-depth on how you're actually supposed to complete your objective. You connect your train with the side buttons and you click on the worker and what you need worked on. That is all I know how to do. I can't even complete the first objective on the first level due to not understanding what I need to do. There is no tutorial or anything like a tutorial. There are however info pages that you can read, but they don't tell you much. I eventually gave up because I had no idea what to do. If there was a tutorial or something explaining what the hell was going on, it  may  be worth $1.  This game is just a 'Simulator' cash grab. Just save your money and buy something from the Train Simulator or TrainZ franchise if you want a decent train game.  P.S. For you die hard train fans out there, I recommend checking out Thomas the Train Engine or Thomas and Friends. Best show revolving around trains even if it's meant for little kids. That show was marvelous."

446570,Grove - VR Browsing Experience,"Eh, needs work. Not very intuitive controls or experience. I am looking forward to what it will offer as it, hopefully, gets updated. For now there are better VR browsing experiences. Will recommend when it is worth paying for.  Why similar apps are better: - I am not wanting to be looking all over at the open browsers; I will likely be typing so all the windows are going to be in my front field of view. - Need to be able to control the windows pitch you open; otherwise when you move them around they just look odd and are unable to see proper.   You can only browse the web; I get it that's what this is for but what is the need to see all the windows in awkward positions. I can't really find a need to have this or what I would realistically use it for within the limited environment."

446600,Magi Trials,"I love Dharker Studio games! this one especially given the magical/fantasy setting!  My only complaint is it is a little too easy not to fail, played through on my first blind route trying to get the Shira or Eri Route and ended up finding myself on the charlie route without having really trying to get to know her. That aside i loved all the characters and the over all story and the different endings! Recommend this game to anyone!"
446620,Zombie Training Simulator,This was one of the first VR titles i got and it still is the one i goto most often for a quick blast. The guns all work so well.

446800,Transport Fever,I love the game alot! Kinda hard to lean from scratch but hell it gets better has it goes on!
446830,The Lonesome Fog,"A very short, but very nice little story with very nice art and atmospheric sound. Definitely something to watch with your kids (they also seem to love the slight animations and the posibility to drag the pictures around a bit).  And unlike the Shelter games, there aren't any invisible ninjas cutting onions in the room..."
446870,Glitchrunners,Game looks good in the store page video and screenshots but it's incredibly boring and the made on budget with Unity feeling comes through very strongly. Bought it for multiplayer via SteamLink and the graphics are decent but it's just not fun at all...

4470,Silverfall: Earth Awakening,"I was desperate for a new ARPG a while ago and bought this for a few bucks...not worth. The mechanics, skills, progression, basically everything is pretty poorly put together."
447010,Bird of Light,"  Pretty cool game, at first more intuitive approach needed, though could be fun for youth"
447020,Farming Simulator 17,"Good game, but doesn't suport steering wheel ( Acme RS )"
447040,Watch_Dogs 2,"Purchased on a whim for $40 during the Steam Winter sale, despite the less than stellar word of mouth on the first Watch Dogs 1. I'm not a PvP kinda guy, but the random matchmaking and invasion events are an absolute blast and lead to some absolutely insane car chases through the city.  Great variety of music. Got some new favorite songs out of this. 'Drink all the Beer, Hack all the Things.' Good acting and character design. Hard not to fall in love with everyone on your team. Except Ray. He probably has crabs. Decent story. Kept me engaged and I usually muddle around in a game for the immediate novelty and then dump it. It's a mix of stealth, 3rd person shooting, droping care packages on people from drones, driving RC cars through vents, basic wiring puzzles. "
447100,XLR, Early Access Review
447170,"Destiny's Princess: A War Story, A Love Story","After 2 hours of gameplay I had to demand a refund on this game. The amount of cringe in the character's personalities is damn too high!  Now dont get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Japanese warlords and warriors like Masamune Date, Nobunaga Oda, Yukimura and so on, and that is exactly the problem!   Maybe when I started this game I expected some realistic touch in their personality that made me look forward to it, instead that was not the case at all.    The incest did not settle well with me, that was just ♥♥♥♥ing mental!    Don't even get me started on the dialogue...  Conclusion: 2Edgy4Me  "
447180,My Secret Pets!,"I wish there was a 'meh' rating available since I kind of struggled with deciding on this one. The character designs were very nice and it's a cute premise, with a very interesting connecting storyline. The problem is that the game just felt so short to me. I wanted more time with the humanized pets, I don't want to spoil the game but the amount of time you had with them just didn't allow for any connections to spark in my mind. Get it if you just love otome games in general and want one with a fantasy setting but just be warned it's rather short. I'd get it on sale if you do."
447190,Pub Encounter,"I'm not that old of a person, really I am in my twenties, and I can see how a game based on romancing older gentlemen may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but for me this game wave really enjoyable. I will be honest and say I do tend to like older men in real life, and this game was very fun. I find it a bit odd to play a game that the romance options are teens, because of me being older than that. I love visual novel games, but most are targeted towards a younger group sadly.  Pub Encounter, is a good game with different characters and each story is very real in how it could happen. I have meet a few gentlemen that a few of the characters reminded me of.  Not over the top, good story, and nice CGs. All and all, a good visual novel to play. "
447200,The Men of Yoshiwara: Ohgiya," TL;DR:  If you're not sure whether to get this one or the original Men of Yoshiwara (Kikyua), you'd probably be happier with Kikuya. There is less content in this version and I agree with those who've said they didn't like it as much as the first. It also still has the poor translation/editing quality that plagued the first. That said, it might be worth picking up on sale.  ---   Overall Impression:  Again, it is originally a mobile otome game, ported to PC. The quality level mobile otome needs to have to be accepted is much lower - and this game is not especially well edited, with typos everywhere. The romances didn't live up to the first game's romances (with the exception of one guy, whose story was the best in the series, imho) - but the heroine is much more awesome than the first. I'll be comparing this game to the first game in the series a lot, so be prepared.   Content:  As with Kikuya, the content rating is approximately 'R-18'. The images hover at around the PG-13 level at the most spicy, but the language can get pretty direct. If you prefer reading 'sweet romances' with closed door sex/no sex, you will not be happy with this story as sex (as brief as it is) is certainly 'open door'. As for other content concerns, I didn't find it as 'objectionable' as the first, but will instead give a blanket warning that this is a game written for Japanese sensibilities with an R-18 content level, set in a fictional historical past. In short - if you're not prepared to be at least a little put-off/offended by cultural differences, you'd better just move on because there might be something here that will upset you.   Translation : The translation quality itself is not too bad. There was very little that made me stumble in terms of understanding the story/what people were implying with what they said. Unfortunately...   Editing : The editing was, as before with Kikuya, pretty terrible. It's not as embarrassing as I found Kikuya's text to be, but there were still lots of typos, missing words/parts of sentences, missing punctuation, confused words (in the vein of their/there); etc.    Art : It's sort of a mixed bag, as before. Unfortunately for this game, it appears they cut even more corners. There are fewer unique poses/costume changes for each character, fewer side characters who get sprites (I think there were none, actually, aside from the servant), recycled backgrounds from the first game (which is fine since it takes place in many of the same places more or less simultaniously with the first game), and really sloppy CGs in places. (I was fascinated in a way with seeing stray lines in areas the composition of the image actually drew attention to. I assume the deadline was very close for it to have been left as-is.) Without double-checking, I think there were fewer CGs for each route too. Those complaints aside, the art was still nice.   Character Design : I think I overall preferred the character design from this game to the first. The characters were fairly distinct from each other, and even the characters that were in similar roles/positions to the characters in the first game looked distinct from each other. (That said - they do overlap quite a bit.)   Story : I draw attention yet again that this is an mobile otome port. The standards between an otome for PC/console and an otome for mobile are vastly different. The writing is 'choppier' and shorter, meant to be consumed while waiting in line or riding the train or something - so each chapter is quite short and there's no real luxury of a slow boil. Even in the best storyline the game offers (IMHO, anyway), the story proceeds quickly and character development can take a sudden and surprising leap. You have to keep this in mind when judging the work (as you wouldn't really compare a short story to a novel either).  Each hero's arc in this game explores the concept of the series premise and how it can bring trouble to not only the man in question, but any woman who might fall in love with a courtesan from Yoshiwara. For better or worse, it's extremely easy to get the 'best' ending with each hero, so you're probably more likely to have to take the trouble figuring out how to get the mere 'good' ending instead.   I personally didn't find any of the heroes of Ohgiya, bar one, to match up to the heroes in Kikuya. I actually would consider myself very indifferent to most of the storylines and it took me awhile to pick up the game to finish it. For me, Asagiri's (the pretty blond guy who wears pink and purple and smells nice) did, however, make the entire game for me. I'm very glad I left him until last. I might find his route to be the most interesting in the series - but perhaps that is  because  I had played all the other routes in the series before his and understood the heartbreak of Yoshiwara so well. I can't actually pick out any route in this game as 'bad', but I didn't enjoy them as much.    The Heroine : Unlike Kikuya's 'good-hearted idiot', this heroine might be shy and obedient, but is overall quite sensible and has backbone. I rather liked her and found her situation of coming to Yoshiwara to conceive an heir for the family business to be more palpable than Kikuya's more awkward situation.    In closing...  Ohgiya is probably not going to knock your socks off, but if you wanted to experience more in the world of Yoshiwara, I can certainly recommend it for Asagiri's route alone. (Though I'd personally say to play him last.) I would suggest you try to pick it up on sale, however, to avoid disappointment."

447530,VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,"I got this game from a friend and...  It's a absolutely gorgeous game with it's classy pixel art style and music is really nice!   But most importantly is the story and the characters, They've made it so well dont and it's very fleshed out and I *love* the fact that it has so many different icons and personalities (also sexuality differences, which is amazing for being LBGTQ)  I absolutely suggest you to check out this game even if you're not too much into visual novels, the dialogs and story telling will still be so worth it and I promise that you will have such a blast playing this game!  My personal rating of the game is 9/10   Go check it out!!"

447990,Spectrubes,"(Edit to what was previously a silly accidentally made-public draft review... please excuse!)  An aesthetically pleasing C64-ish puzzle game. What is this game? Retro-mini-blocks maze. Two brother or sister blocks opposite sides of maze- 'eye'-icon blocks. Some little compu-baby circa 1981 would call 'cute.' You look to the LEFT... move towards the apoca-portal; BUT wait, you need to look to the right, nudge up to the wall, move the other blockhead towards the other portal.. look LEFT. Nudge up to the wall, move that lil sister in place. If you go cross-eyed you lose. Use both eyes, one side of the brain. Take a sip out of the glass of cyan-blue, then take a gulp out the cyan-purple.  Clever little puzzle game. I added the game to my library a few weeks ago. Popped it on a few times. I'm on level 6. Might take me the rest of the year to finish all? (Not sure how many levels). In any case, I will have gotten my moneys worth, and quite possibility in this same time frame the dev might pop on the Steam version at least another latter complex level or two? Periodic extra levels would be desired and this game is certainly set up for such potential and more interesting 'eye'-deas.  If you seek or want some retro C64/easy simple puzzler goodness, a cut above in wonderful simplicity, I recommend.  Good game!"
448000,Sparkle ZERO,"I played Sparkle 2 and 3 before, but this is just bad.  I got bored in the very first minute, after your realize that you just have to eat things and nothing can harm you.  You'll be able to finish the game and get all achivements in about one hour, if you don't take any breaks.  It should be from the Sparkle series, doesn't feel anything close though."
448010,RePete, https://youtu.be/2htMnNyFJko   Wield the power of time and space with a wanton disregard to temporal physics and the spiritual ramifications of cloning in this puzzle platformer.  Record input then play it back to flip levers or position a body based platform to jump to higher places. Par times and hidden coins increase the complexity to offer a lot more challenge than it appears at the start. The use of character text adds a lot of personality to RePete and his clones.
448020,Share,"In the beginning of the game, you have to drive a УАЗ car in forest with terrible controls, enjoy &lt;10 FPS on 2012 year PC and listen to Russian Punk style music (i'm Russian too, but i do not like the Punk music instead of Фёдор Чистяков's Ноль).  After 30 seconds the game hangs.  I hope the later parts of the game are better...."

448060,X-17, Early Access Review
448070,Red Risk,"  Awkward controls, boring player-characters, and uninspired maps. This just isn't a fun game.  - Most of the controls are done with mouse. You move by right clicking and attack by left clicking. This is extremely awkward, and makes it further difficult to fight. (probably intentional) - I tried all 3 characters, and while they are unique to each other, none of them are suited for surviving. There is a pistol wielder, an axe wielder, and a sniper.  The pistol can fire quickly but does little damage. This is probably the best choice for surviving, but you end up just running around the enemies as they try to corner you firing into them.  The axe is purely melee. They are heavily dependant on the ability to stun lock the enemy. You must be directly in front of the enemy to attack them. Their special ability is a spinning attack, which is helpful when you're surrounded.  The sniper is useless. Semi-powerful shots, but a single chamber rifle. Reloading after hitting 1 enemy when there's a horde after you is time consuming and frustrating. I commited suicide while playing the sniper, just to end it. - I didn't continue past the first map, but usually you want your first map to be amazing, so players will enjoy playing in the first place. This first map was awful. It's very small, and has several 'arms' attached to it. These arms are very thin and usually a dead-end. So, running around the enemy is nearly impossible, forcing you to take damage as you try to get around them. - While there is a nice variety of enemies to deal with, the overall gameplay is generic and lackluster. The enemies walk towards you, and you hit them until they die. The AI is designed as mindless drones that attempt to overpower you with numbers rather than any type of strategy.  In between rounds, you are awarded 1 token to purchase a survival item. This can be restoring all your health, restoring all your ammo, putting your hunger to 0%, and putting your thirst to 0%. This is never explained, and when first attempting to open the shop, it will state, 'You are not near a stand' after a bit, I realized that there are weapon racks near the spawn point. You must be standing next to these in order to purchase items. Enemies also drop pills that restore health, hunger, and thirst. Though it's 1% per pill, making it almost useless  Just overall, the game feels like it suffers from being too generic. They need more characters to play as (perhaps toss out archetypes and let people select their own weapons), and better maps (more open, so you can feel like you're not always cornered)"

448090,Virtual Rogue,"Interface review: • First few seconds in the main menu: 'I can't use a mouse? Not even WASD keys? ENTER is not working?' Needs more user-friendliness. • First few seconds in the game settings menu: 'Wtf is Angling? No descriptions?' Well at least the character does have one.  • Warning messages (such as those that appear when picking up upgrades) disappear quickly. • No panels for texts? It hurts my eyes. • Some texts go through the edge of the screen, making it impossible to be read.  Gameplay review: • Pressed Tab and the game glitched and froze in a white screen. Happened twice. Stopped playing after the second one. • The limit in shooting at certain directions is kind of weird for a shooter game. I mean, we aren't in the 90's anymore. The angled shot concept is interesting, but I still disagree with having to shoot at 4 directions only.  Design review: • Main menu seems to give a sad feeling despite the cheery music in the background. • Some sprites look cute. Some... Look weird. • Some sprites blend in badly with the tileset. • Music is okay, but it loops and after a few good loops it's kinda boring to listen to."
448110,So Long Earth, Early Access Review
448140,Night light," https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN9-0JfRIR0&amp;feature=youtu.be   This is just a pixelated map thrown together with collectibles and randomly spanning enemies.  The game obviously tries to imitate superior games such as Minecraft or The Forest, but is plagued by technical issues and offers nothing original in return.  Here are some issues I have with this game:  - There's no tutorial: the game only tells you to press 'F' to pick up items -- everything else is up to you to figure out.  - Rudimentary crafting mechanics: the game boils down to picking up items from the floor (water bottles, wood, stone),  and clicking a button to create something. There's no sense of mining the environment or crafting the components,  beyond a cookie-cutter mechanism.  - Enemy model: the enemy is supposed to be a zombie, but it looks like a playable character, apart from making generic zombie sounds that get old really fast. More annoying than scary or interesting.  - Elementary AI: The enemies just follow you around, sometimes in a single-file, and get stuck in the environment.  - Fatigue system: You can run indefinitely, easily escaping the enemies until there are 300 of them after a few minutes.  - Technical issues: I've fallen through the border of the map, gone through objects, gotten hurt by enemies hitting me through walls. Could keep roaming around the map after dying. Haven't been able to put up a single wall (after creating a wall, the game only allows me to hit enemies with the wall).  - Overwhelming number of enemies: Enemies spawn all the time, leaving no room to enjoy the 'crafting experience'. I experience lag when I had 20 guys chasing me.  - Uninteresting map: The forest map is very small, has some houses, towers, trees, and collectibles. Nothing to harvest or explore.  - Costs $6.  Yes, all of that happened, as you can see from my video.  My playthrough consisted mostly of looking for bottles of watter, trying to figure out how to play the game, and running into issues."
448160,WOLFLAME,"This is rather a neutral review. I like the old school graphics and sound, but the game mechanics is not my cup of tea.   Most of the enemy bullets are too fast to dodge, you have to keep moving around or get killed, and if you get caught when changing direction, you're dead. You lose everything on death, which is a little unfair in later levels. But well, the developer is trying to make a Raiden clone so that's fine if you like the origin.  The game has 10 levels, considering it's a shoot em up, that's a lot. And there is a Save/Load function, you can save the game anywhere and load to start from that level. This is handy when you find yourself hard to concentrate after a few levels, or when you made some really silly mistakes.  And this game has 4 difficulties, Easy is really easy(I managed to 1cc in my first try, with a little bit luck), you can also get almost all achievements by just playing easy(Only 1 exception, you have to complete normal, with infinite continues). That's very friendly to beginners, which is something really lacking in the shoot em up genre."

448370,IS Defense,"  It's always great when you're interested in a game solely for the comedy its premise provides at face value, only to play the thing and become impressed by the its own merits.  The idea of ISIS rising up and storming Europe seemed like a novel, perhaps even absurd, concept for a game; however, the developers behind the now-infamous 'Hatred' made it work. Terrorists are right up there with Nazis (thanks, Wolfenstein) on the list of enemies you can't feel bad about murdering in cold blood. Hell, you could remove the terrorists from the equation, replace them with ravenous panda bears, and this would still be a fun game. IS Defense is a member of a dying genre of first-person shooters: the 'shooting gallery.' I've seen this genre most prevalently in arcades, and by Ysmir, IS Defense would've cleared my pocket of quarters if it were in an arcade. Like other games in the genre, you are placed in a stationary position behind a machine gun and tasked with mowing down the frothing hordes of enemies charging at you from the beachhead. Though it may sound simple, things can quickly get hectic and out of hand, with terrorists swarming your encampment from every imaginable angle. Fortunately, IS Defense also boasts a progression system for your character, gun turret, rocket launcher, and support calls. The more terrorists you mow down, the more points you can put into the system, and, in turn, the more terrorists you can mow down. As the bodycount rises, you'll be able to unlock additional maps on which to indulge the game's feedback loop of killing and progression. Really, that's all there is to be said about IS Defense.  In all, IS Defense is a simple game: shoot, kill, die, repeat. The experience can get somewhat repetitive after a while, but the game is something that is best enjoyed in short bursts. At this price point, the game is certainly worth it.  Small addendum: I don't know if it has to do with my settings, my rig, the game's optimization, or a combination of those three, but the framerate can become downright abhorrent at times."
448390,Maneki's Curse,"WOW - This is seriously free!!?? You should definately get it! A game where you can walk around and take ghosts souls, fight monsters and get lost in a labyrinth."
448400,Hidden Object 6-in-1 bundle,"WAY to many different locations that take you back to the very beginning and your inventory tends to get so big you forget you have certain items in them and lose track of what you have. Voice acting is awful compared to Artifex games and the graphics feel very stretched, certain items during HOG parts of the game tend to be at the very buttom that are almost impossible to see as well as easy items such as a soccer ball are extremely discolored and don't resemble the item AT ALL. I am only 2 games in but the trend seems to be the same. Avoid this unless you have played all the Artifex Mundi games and need to pass the time until they release another game!"

448520,Deranged Rabbits,"Fun, but quite short in my opinion. "
448530,Square's Route,"This game really should've been either a mobile game or a flash online game. It feels very out of place in the steam store. It has some bugs and the puzzles honestly aren't that engaging. It doesn't really suck me in. I don't know that I'd even think it was worth it on sale, it's really difficult for me to come back to the game and want to play it again.  It almost feels like there are TOO MANY levels. The progression is so slow without any new features being introduced, it gets really dull.  Pros: -It's not horrible to look at -It'd make a great flash game -It's cheap  Cons: -It's not great to look at -Puzzles are tedious -Does not add new features for long lengths -Feels more frustrating than challenging -Music is repetitive -Sideways controls not intuitive -No achievements -Long levels that require multiple playthroughs  I can't really recommend."
448540,TERROR LAB,"Maybe if it was free. Not scary, boring, needs a grammar check. Not worth the bucks."
448560,Mind Games,We have all seen these type of 'puzzles' before. If you are really bored it will waste some of the time away for you. Not too challenging. If you want to spend a couple of dollars on it go ahead it will give the developer some money to buy a a Clark bar and some fries.
448570,Origin Of Destiny: Crimson Awakening, Early Access Review
448580,Dead End Road,I got this game going off others posative reviews as i do that a lot when it comes to indy horror games this time it was a mistake. You need to drive around and pick up three mission items for this old lady you get a map and a crapy yugo to drive around in to collect these items. You start off with £100 witch is needed for fuel to fix your car and buy the mission items in question. And going to a couple of towns then refueling and fixing car takes 90% of you cash i was low health and hit a GHOST that litraly killed the car and gave me game over must have been those ectoplasm filled balls that broke the engine

448670,Pinball HD Collection,"I had this game on my I-Phone and enjoyed it quite well, the port is a little noticeable, but as it came out in early August and I had not had a chance to pick it up yet, well...I did, and all Ican say is wow, I particularly like (if not love) the Halloween table, its quite enjoyable and all the tables (in general) have a good amount of replayablility. Physics on each table are fairly good, and the controls are a bit funky (and I don't see a place withing the program to actually configure them, much to my chagrin), but if you want controller support for this game you can you use JoyToKey, which will allow you to configure accordingly, but for 20 bucks you get 15 tabes, not bad price (pinball machine to dollar ratio). I am not really going to complain about much of anything on this game and will enjoy this game for many years to come.  I certainly hope you pick up on this game, really two thumbs up, and please add me as a friend if you play ;).  Darkendone{LDH}"
448710,VirZOOM Arcade,"The games are simple, but entertaining. The bike offers a lot for a fairly low price which is great considering how much you already spent on the compatible headset. The only thing I can really think to complain about is that none of the games really have a sense of momentum (except when flying on the pegasus). One part of riding on my real bike that I really enjoy is pushing myself super hard and simply riding past other riders without touching my pedals. I like the feeling of speed that carries me forwards. Instead on this I feel like I'm 100% of the time going up hill. If I stop pedaling I stop moving. That doesn't feel right to me, but you know what? If I want a better feeling game, I can make one, because their Unity compatible SDK is openly available on their website."
448750,Infinity Saga,"I've not beaten the game entirely, but from what I've done so far, I'm somewhat to a half point/near the end I think. Anyways, so far I've enjoyed the game very much. I love the humor it has and the artwork for the characters is awesome, as well as the backstory to the game. As for the fighting style of gameplay, it's your pretty standard classic rpg style and it's pretty relaxing aside from running into monsters very frequently, but it's relatively easy to just escape a fight and keep on exploring. Very rarely have I been ambushed or couldn't escape a battle with too serious of injuries.  Grinding in the game so far is pretty easy, but the boss fights can get rather challenging. If anything, I would've liked to have the enemies have health bars so I could see whether or not they're close to death and so I could better determine which enemies to strike at first, but that's just a minor suggestion.  The sound effects can get pretty loud if you're a head/earphone user like I am. There were a few times I did have to remove my earphones due to it being too loud, but you can easily tune the volume up or down with your own computer's volume if you must. I would suggest a volume control system in the game, but it's really not necessary as there isn't really anything too important that you have to really listen in to unless you're the type that wants to mute the music and listen to the sound effects, or vice versa. There is both, really cool sound effects and awesome choices of music though.  Overall, I am enjoying the game and I'd definitely recommend it to others to try out at the very least. My only advice would be to pick your fights carefully and never be afraid to use the 'Run-away' option so you could keep on exploring and survive."
448780,Sixtieth Kilometer,"Really interesting audiovisual novel, where you have to make hard decisions which have consequences on whole story line. I really enjoyed this game and have to say.. best game for 0,22€ (in sale) ever.  Positive + Cheap game with cards + Long story with more endings + Interesting characters + Nice background + Nice OST  Negative - I miss achievements in this game"
448790,Infinity Wings - Scout & Grunt,"its a simple and classic scrolling shoot'em up.  graphics are good (i like the spinning rock and when your ship dive) and the gameplay is basic (its an old school shooter)  on Infinity Wings, you have to destroy asteroids and some bosses, the game that is fine for a few evenings when you want to kill time.  music is good too and the game offer achievements and cards.(for collector around here)  Game is pretty cheap, not a big risk~"
448820,Planet in the Shadows,"I could have really enjoyed this game, if it actually worked. You have NO control over when the game chooses to save, so you're basically just playing until it forces you to save in a situation which is untenable and you have to start over. Supposedly this bug has been fixed as of this review -- I assure you it is not. Fought stubbornly to the 5th level or so because I figured I might be able to power through it... boy was I wrong. As an effect of 'gas vents' the game started saving every other move to finally hang up in an infinite loop of autosaving while my character was forced to be in stasis while making fuel cells. Because stasis goes on for thousands of turns, and it seemed to be saving every turn to other turn at this point... the game ground to a screeching halt. Wish I could have solved the mystery -- but the game is broken."
448830,ASMR Universe,"Irritated the hell out of the wife, which is a bad thing. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the neighbors, which is a good thing. Made the dog go insane, which is a bad thing. Runs on any computer in the house, (XP, Vista, 7 and godforsaken 10 ) which is a good thing.  Can't really recommend it unless you're into driving people nuts with sound effects.....but if you are, then go right ahead. you won't be dissapointed with BEES, BEES, BEES, BEES."
448880,Spells 'n' Stuff, Early Access Review
448910,Axes and Acres,"The look and premise of the game seemed interesting enough, however the game has one significant flaw, and that is complete lack of written documentation and/or wiki. Instead, you are given a tutorial that does not explain anything, only orders you to do certain action (that is NOT the way I want to learn about games), and lengthy tutorial video that of course cannot be consulted when you want to explore a particular feature of the game.   This would not be such a problem in case of an established genre like point and click adventures that are simple enough to pick up and play. However, this particular game has very unusual conventions, even grasping what exactly are actions available to players and what are their use and impact on the game. For example, you spend workers to move other workers. How the heck you should 'discover' this peculiar mechanic without a proper manual?   The interface is a haphazard mixture of buttons of various sizes, with vague descriptions like 'Build 3'. Build 3 what? Compare this to games like Renowned Exploreres that create a set of distinctive symbols representing knowledge, renown, supplies, etc, that simplify the understanding of the game quite a lot. Yes, there are tooltips, but they are very inconsistent in the way they provide information.   Axes and Acres may be even a very good game, but I will never know. Fearing that I will not have enough time to decide if I like it due to the necessary battle with the interface and lack of explicit explanation of the game fundamental principles, I have requested a refund."
448980,The Divergent Series: Allegiant VR,"While it is free, I cant really 'recommend it' because it isnt built well for VR, and the game experience itself is uninteresting, there are much better free VR experiences out there.  Good: Nice models, grpahics, lighting etc. Its free. Well done on the hand models though, they are shaped like your real life hands holding the controllers, bravo! Its only 5 min :)  Not so good: Its fairly uninteresting to play, the acting (both voice and animations) is wooden, the script is nonsensical, the controls for the turret are awful, the shooting is boring. It requires 2.5*2.5 to play unnecessarily, replacing UI elements onto the same wall and allowing smaller play areas would have been smarter. It completely bugged out on me the first time I ran it while re-running immediately and it ran fine."

449020,The Bottom of the Well,"This game is super cool.  I haven't play it for so long, but I like the story. I wish I got more time to play it, because if you do so, you want 100% of your mind playing this interactive Story.  The Artstyle ist very cool, too :)  This game is innovative. I haven't figure out to survive with that few stuff I can take with me ^^ It's like you reading a good book.  I don't understand why is it free to play :/ It worth a little price on it."

449090,Zombie Parking,"It's not often that I recommend a terrible game, but this is a case where I will. Make no mistake: It's terrible. There's only one map, two weapons, and assortment of powerups and his and her zombies (only two modles.) The game is so simple, that the hardest acheivements were the two for recharging your shield and health. Some of the glitches in this game are almost features - such as the fact that occasionally the unlimited ammo powerup just stays on. And glitch is almost meta: If you play long enough without dying, the zombies dwindle away to nothing, leaving you nothing to do but quit...almost as if it's saying that if the hero in these games were to ever rid the world of zombies, there's nothing left to live for.  So why do I still recommend it? Because for 89 cents, I got 3 hours of play time and some pity laughs, and that was totally worth it."

And that is coming from someone who isn't even a fan of the yuri sub-genre and I can tell you off the bat that even if you're unsure due to the type of visual novel this one is very likely to surprise you, pleasantly so.  I'm going to use an A through F rating system for the different elements of this visual novel:  Art: A+ Story: B Music: B Charcters: A CGs: B+ Variety: B  Would I reccomend this one? Highly, this is the best Hanako games had to offer so far. And I like a lot of their VNs! Worth the full price!"
449300,Planar Conquest,"This is one of the worst games I have come across in quite some time. It feels as it has been programmed by a 10 year old, no, a 5 year old.

If you want to try it for yourself make sure you don't go past the refund period or you will be flushing your money down the toilet."

Also most of it is; omg my baby lorenzo i love you so much weve only known each other for 3 weeks BUT you're the love of my life *cries for 600 hours*  tldr; lorenzo lorenzo ily so much, weird faces everywhere"
449350,Backstreets of the Mind,"If you like 'Hidden objects' games - Backstreets of the Mind is your choice, if you have not played such kind of games before - you can start with this one. Great photorealistic graphic, nice mini games, interesting storyline. Even my mom got excited from this game! I hope that developers would continue work and soon we would see second part ;)"
449420,Mini's Magic World,"Excellent little platformer, great fun for little ones. Highly recommended."
449450,SPLIT BULLET,"It's a nice, little game where you shoot down various objects flying towards you. It is fun and challenging at the same time. It's only 2 dollars, which costs less than a Team Fortress 2 key, so you can pick it up fairly easy. The game won't last for many dozens of hours, but it's still a nice game to play for a quick time and you will definitely get more than a couple of dollars of enjoyment out of it."
449470,Atulos Online,This game is the worst thing to happen in history since the titanic sank
449520,Rush for gold: California,Rush for gold: California nice
449530,Grand Pigeon's Duty,G8 game m8 it just is so much fun cant wait for infinite warfare and when will the DLC come out. I need this      486 /10 ign f kmn
449540,There's Poop In My Soup,"This a fun, simple game. While it doesn't last very long, it's great if you just wanted something quick to play."
449550,Chicken Invaders 2,"I remember playing this many years ago on my grandparents PC. And ofc, I remember child me getting a little frustrated at how hard the game was.  More recently, I stumbled upon this game here on Steam, and thought I might as well get it, for old times sake. This game is actually fairly easy, but still holds its challenge.  This is a cheap game, that will entertain you for a time, although doesn't have much in the way of replayability compared to others."
449560,Space Ranger ASK,Got some nice Project X flashbacks ;)
449680,SAMOLIOTIK,What is SAMOLIOTIK? This is a   vertical shooting game  .    Pros
449690,Fatal Fight,"at first I liked the game, but the further I progressed in the game it started to become difficult and not like a scaling in difficulty difficult but like a mobile or NES kind of difficult...unffair, if you want a good 2 button beat'em up go play one finger death punch, at least in that game its fair and challenging"
449710,REDCON,I didn't think i would like this game as much as i did.
449730,Ahnayro: The Dream World,"Not only am I blown away by how thoroughly the backstory work for this game has been completed, but the way the gameplay itself can emulate trying to resolve your own dreams in real life is awesome. I still have little clue how it will all fit together when all is said and done, but I cannot wait to see!   With that said, a HUGE kudos to the devs---this game rocks! :)"
449780,Jacob,-Looks at the F2P section -Finds this game -Gets excited because this is my name -Plays game -Becomes sad
449800,Attack on Titan / A.O.T. Wings of Freedom,"Game is fine. Got it in sale. For ppl who like to grind its perfect (I like grinding).   BUT why the f*** do i have to buy a complete 40€ costume DLC Pack if I just want to  get a 0,99€ costume for Mikasa...   PS: I saw in the description of the package that you DONT get the Mikasa costume if you buy the package"

449940,! That Bastard Is Trying To Steal Our Gold !,"First off, the gameplay is basic. Throw bombs, block up blocks, collect gold. Simple gameplay, but it's so boring and it gets very tedious once you reach the spike levels. The way that the dynamite bounces around makes blowing things up terribly frustrating. The options menu is probably better than the actual gameplay. There's nothing really to this game, just buy Spelunky if you want a game of this nature. It's much less clunky and the gameplay is amazing.  This is the end of the review for this game.  Keep reading if you want to see info about the dev.    This is the same person who developed 'Glow Ball' - The billiard puzzle game, It's time to get out from the solar system, and Sapper's bad dream.  This is the same shady dev that has either joked or been serious   which I highly doubt it's serious based on some of their releases/responses   about having many diseases, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and even posted a status about having brain cancer and wanted to buy the game so he could have treatment. Either this is the most unprofessional developer I've ever seen, or this man/woman/kid needs medical help. Either way, this person needs medical help.

4500,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl,"Escort rogue Duty squad to attack Freedom base, successful raid, heavily armoured well armed Duty companions regroup and pull out. collect my pay for a job well done and watch the remaining Duty veterans walk into anomalies and die.   Such is life in the Zone  Vey atmospheric, tough, suvival horror shooter. Tons of fun but has a vey steep learning curve, a geat introduction to the Zone and its denizns."
45000,Sol Survivor,A vivid top down shooter that puts hit such as Hotline Miami and Dragon Blood to shame.
450020,DAMAGE CONTROL, Early Access Review
450040,Stealth Labyrinth,"This is an interesting concept. The game is not bad, the controls are a little wonky, but for the price, it is not a bad buy in. This is a maybe for me."
450050,Yon Paradox,The way the controls are handled make me nauseous in VR. Also the framerate is low for no apparent reason.
450060,Insane Decay of Mind: The Labyrinth,The WORST comtrols mostly likely due to this being ported (from Rift? ). DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
450110,Amigdala,I do not recommend this game to keyboard and mouse users. But it does work still with a mouse and keyboard. It just seems like a bad port if played that way.  Gameplay With Commentary:         YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;
450120,Capitalism Plus,"This doesn't have the company headquarters so you can't buy technologies from other companies as far as I know, nor will it let you save and use factory templates -- I think those features came out in Capitalism 2.  Otherwise this is a ton of fun! Playing the stock market is the most realistic I've seen in any game - it will teach value buying. Then stomp everyone out there with your vastly superior products! The AI is pretty good too.  It's better to wait for the later versions of Capitalism to come out, but this is pretty good by itself. If you've never played Capitalism, it will keep you busy for quite a while while you wait for the others.  Oh? How does the game work? Well it's like a Donald Trump simulator. You start out with a nice hefty gift from daddy of $5M or more. Then you buy property or play the stock market and build up supply chains and do research and train your employees. But unlike Donald Trump, you have to pay workers rather than going bankrupt to make money. :)  Sell items at department stores and use branding strategies, and buy advertising to gain market share. Also setting up supply chains into your production you might have to rely on other players, which means their supply may not be consistent or prices may fluctuate.  I think the first time I played this was in an economics class in college, and I was quickly hooked. I have never seen a comparable depth of economic simulator in any other game."
450140,Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries,"10/10  Been playing this since I was a boy. The only game I have ever played for this long (came out in '97) Most games I play a dozen times and forget. This game is ETCHED into my memory. The gameplay is perfect for what I want; RTS fighting, resource based economy (resources don't end they just respawn in a different area), no pop limit, no military limit, espionage, boats, siege weapons, etc. I like many games but I LOVE this game. Glad to see all my other fellow 7KAA fans supporting one of, if not, the best RTS ever made. They NEVER made another game exactly like this one. Never."

450220,Overload Playable Teaser,"This is destined to be the ultimate 6DOF arcade shooter experience. The challenge mode, alone, absolutelly nails it in terms of what an arcade experience should be:  - Straight up, no frills action. - Absolutely fluid and immersive controls. - Satisfies your old school bad habit of trying to beat your high scores.  Plus it has the Descent feel to it, just improved. 'Nuff said.  It's probably time for me to move to beta backer status :D"
450250,Aegis of Earth: Protonovus Assault,The game will not boot up. When I try to run the game all I get is a black screan any ideas?
450290,Assault on Arnhem,"Okay I picked this game up with a bundle of a few others made by the same maker . first I have a writing issue from a head tramua in 2004 so excuse the grammer/spelling .  Okay the games sell for about 10 bucks regular at the review time they are 5 bucks I would pay that for this one . I like turn base games they are not for every one , so if you never played one get one in a time frame and intrest you really like do not pay much as they are not for every one either .  these game are not very hard to learn read the manual 20 minutes a play through maybe on the first battle on battle on easy with tips then go to normal take tips off and good to go . Graphics are okay I am playing with Nato counters . thease games are pretty light turn based games also not heavey in depth as I also do some game testing for this type but heavey stratigic ones . I call thease a lunch hour game or 6 pack game play  have not hit any bugs , no heay powerful computer needed . It plays well acording to the historical battles with thought to game play also. remember this was a loss to the allies , a slaughter at one bridge ..  so buy it on sale support a small company that makes a 'nitch' game they are not for every one but want a light lunch hour game that takes some thought as well . then this is it I have few others and they are fun also"
450390,The Lab,  The Lab was an amazing introduction to VR for me. All of the minigames are very polished and replayable. The controls are very intuitive and are very easy to understand as a beginner without much explanation. The attention to detail is also insane. Kudos to Valve for such a great game.
450440,Creepy Castle,Adorable game with an epic plot (and more to come from what i hear). A good number of alternative routes to playthrough via playing dif characters. The sheer amount of stuff present is worth the price :)
450500,Ace of Seafood,"GOTY, honestly"
450540,"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades", Early Access Review
450570,Roadworks Simulator,  10/10 - Would ALT F4 after spending 0.4 hours figuring out how to play again.
450590,Safety Driving Simulator: Car,well what can i say one of the best driving games i have ever played and well worth the price.
450600,Safety Driving Simulator: Motorbike,"Not a very good game, i didn't even get to play it properly. Key bindings didnt even work properly, could not steer the motorbike. I couldn't use the steam overlay. I spent my total 30 minutes of play time just trying to get the game to even work properly, and did it? No.  Atleast i got a refund."
450650,Polyology,I love this game. It's a fun puzzle game which is mostly pure logic (alas there is one or two time sensitive problems). There's nothing more satisfying than working out the solution to any given problem. If you like puzzle games then check it out.
450670,Table Top Racing: World Tour,  You cannot have this much fun in messy places with toy cars as an adult in real life. This reminds me of the childhood I wish I had. The attention to detail is great which makes it even funnier to drive these little things. I normaly disable game music. I was not fast enough and a song started. 2 songs went by before I noticed again that I hadnt turned the game music off. Some people might want to get this just for the music. I have not heard all of it. What I have heard sounds good. I recommend the game to everyone who made a track out of anything around and drove a little car on it at least once. There are enough cars (I do not have the DLC) and upgrades for those cars to keep me entertained for a while. I've only fully upgraded the bug at the time of this.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MozgA4Yc34 
450700,The Spatials: Galactology, Early Access Review
450740,Mind Unleashed,"Woooooooooow what a disappointing experience...  Played with the HTC VIVE &gt;&gt;&gt; No proper motion controllers support, almost no updates or support... This is amateurish but in a bad way. Don't buy this, even for a buck. :-("
450850,Cube Land Arena, Early Access Review
45100,Secret of the Magic Crystal,amazing horse mechanics
451000,Ember Kaboom,"Nice music, nice art style, and very nice game! But beware, quite short."
451010,Kittypocalypse,"Enjoyable game until reaching Tuldigon level, which as another user pointed out is very difficult to complete. Please adjust difficulty for this level.  UPDATE  Ok I had to change my review, I don't think the Tuldigon level difficulty is right, despite what the devs said to the previous comment on this. I also watched the gameplay in 'normal' difficulty but the video seems edited and I can't really see what the guy is doing.  I won't be playing again until this level is patched."
451100,Cubikolor,"  Really cool game ! Love the stylish visuals and clever level design. You have to move a cube with 6 faces of different colors over a checked pattern and try to match colors. Easy to begin, hard to master!"
451130,Khan: Absolute Power,good but sucks
451200,Candlelight,very nice platformer with great sound and graphics.
451210,Rocket Shooter,"The game opens just following the events of Halo: Reach, as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace near a mysterious ring-shaped space station, called 'Halo' by the enemy in the game, the Covenant. A Covenant fleet attacks and heavily damages the Pillar of Autumn."
451350,Tropical Fish Shop 2,This game stinks worse then the fish. 7/7
451400,Meridian: Squad 22,"If you really like to be a super nanny for your units and you just love to be stressed, then this is a game for you.   Personally I really want to like this game, but because of the two last points, I just can’t.  Pro’s: 1.) Looks appealing and sound good. 2.) I like the story, it’s not deep, but it has a nice setup that give the battle meaning and makes you care for what comes next. 3.) It’s old school RTS, build a base, get resource, train units and kill the enemy. The resource gathering is very Starcraft. 4.) I like the idem for upgrades is scattered around the map, rewarding you for exploring.  Con’s: 1.) The campaign has only 9 missions? and is over very quickly. It’s also ending on a cliffhanger, so you won’t get the bad guy... 2.) The foot soldier is faster than your vehicle? – it’s just stupid. 3.) It would be nice if you could group your units and give them a number. 4.) Problem with placing buildings. Especially the turrets, where you sometimes can't build one in a strategic well placed spot.  5.) The amount of units you can build from start is just to skimpy. And the upgrade gives you only 2 more? – come on... 6.) You can't repair your buildings with your Drone. The only way is with a commander ability with a 45 second cooldown, which is desperately needed to heal your units, because they die very fast in battle.  But the worst two is...  7.) A crap AI!!! The AI has a prebuilt base and will start attacking you almost in the beginning of the game. Which means, that if you survive the first 5 minutes of the game – you will win. How about give us 5 minutes to build our base? And then have a battle against an opponent that will exploit your week spots… As it is right now, it’s just feels like rush hour...  8.) All your units is suicidal!!! When you're getting attacked, two or three units will go out to meet the enemy and it’s best if they can get completely clear from the protective turrets. When the other units can see that the first team is dead, then two or three more will go out to meet the enemy alone. And if you click on Hold Position, then they will only stay ground and not return fire. WTF!!!  So it seems to me, that the units don’t want to be in this game and would rather die..."
451520,theBlu,"Sorry, but theBlu went from being my #1 go-to program for introducing newbies to the VR experience, to the most unstable and unusable program in my line up. I literally cannot get through a single experience without a crash now... and it usually crashes within the first minute before anything interesting even happens.  Don't know what happened, but unless there's an update/fix soon, I'm just going to delete theBlu off my system for good. Really frustrated."
451540,Snakes on an Extradimensional Plane,"  Super fun VR game, one of the best i've played so far. Super addictive too! Make sure your chaperone walls are accurate and your wrist straps before playing because it gets intense."
451570,Demetrios - The BIG Cynical Adventure,  The developer contacted me with a code for this and I'm glad they did. This is done by a one person developer team and the graphics are lovely and hand drawn. It has just my sort of humour in it and it's made me enjoy playing a point and click game again.  It's a good storyline so far and it's worth getting just to see the delightful toilet at the start :)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jo5Jn9Cq7s 
451600,CounterAttack, Early Access Review
451650,Whirligig, Early Access Review
451660,Trucker,    This Game has been supplied by a dear friend of mine.
451670,War Birds: WW2 Air strike 1942,The game is ok.
451700,Secrets of Deep Earth Shrine,This game has a good concept (not new) that could turn out into something great. However this game still looks very raw and a bit buggy tbh. It has a feel of an early access game but unfortunately it isn't. I don't know if the devs are still updating this game but they should do it.  For the lack of content and polishing and the price asked for it I can't recommend this game. Final score: 4/10
451760,Highway Blossoms,"Highway Blossoms went above and beyond what I expected from a Visual Novel, I'm extremely glad I took the time to play this gem of a game.   Story wise, the game is rather short. But that's mostly because I read pretty fast, so I clocked in around 4 hours or so of reading instead of the stated 6 hours or so stated. Guess all that fanfiction reading skills got put to good use lmao.   One thing I liked about the writing in general was how trim it was. There's almost no filler throughout the entire story and I can appreciate a game that tells a simple, great story rather than just dragging on for no particular reason but to increase your playtime. The other thing I liked was the humor, which got quite alot of chuckles from me throughout. Also, I found the main couple Amber and Marina heart stoppingly cute, and their dialouge even more so.   Art-wise, the game is flawless. CG's and backgrounds are superb on my monitor and the words in the text box are easy to read and easy on the eyes. Character sprites (is that the right word?) do occasionally move and I love how sutble and effective it was in trying to make everything more lifelike. Masterful programming. There is no bugs, as far as I can tell, which makes it the icing on top of the cake.   The music is pleasant throughout as well. I never once thought the background music was grating. On the contrary I found it rather relaxing to listen to, so I'll definitely be getting the DLC soundtrack. Highway Blossoms also makes good use of its music as well as silence. There are stretches of story that have no music at all - which makes the seriousness of the current scene pack a heavier punch.   Overall, I think that Highway Blossoms is a quality VN. For it's length and quality of the content, the asking price is more than fair. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this if I was a yuri fan (viva la yuri) or a avid VN reader.   TL:DR - 9/10"
451780,Trillion,"You and your band of 6 waifus must line up one at a time to fight an old god  Things do not go as planned  I'm so sorry, everyone"
451840,Out of Ammo,I regret purchasing this game.   The graphics are bad.  You cant win. Only last a bit longer.  There is no storyline.  It is expensive for what it is.   
451870,Nighttime Terror: Dessert Defender,It's really more of a top-down shooter game than a tower defense one. The developers should have focused on one genre instead of failing at both.
451880,Catch a Falling Star,  Average puzzle game. Menus buggy
451900,WizardCraft,"*Loads game up* *Options appear* *Turns sound down* *No Button to go back* *Try's Esc, Backspace, O and Delele' *Nothing happens* *ALT + F4* *Loads game up and goes on mission 1* *Trys to move camera with WASD* *Accidentally swap building selected* * ALT +F4* *Requests Refund*  -10/10 Would buy again"
451920,Thorne - Death Merchants,A lot of problems make for a poor package. Combat and menu's are extremely clunky. Full screen looks poorly stretched. Natural window is tiny and cannot be resized through convenient means. Writing actually isn't bad what I played of it. Payed a buck. I wish I hadn't but not enough to refund it. I just recommend caution before purchase.
451960,The Secret of Pineview Forest,"Ok, I take back what I said. It's a good game. The jumpscare at the end got me, but the rest was just ok. I think it's a good game, but I hear some people can't get past that crazy hunter. I did, and that's why I change my opinion."
451980,The Body VR: Journey Inside a Cell,Simple and gorgeous. I wish we had this in school when I was growing up. A good look into the future of VR.
451990,Cranks and Goggles, Early Access Review
4520,Full Spectrum Warrior,"While there are merits to Full Spectrum Warrior, I cannot recommend the game. I have little doubt that when the game launched in 2004, it was top-of-the-line, however, it has aged poorly.  To start, the visuals are not a problem. Yes, they are dated, but they still hold up surprisingly well. The sound, however, is buggy. Sometimes effects make noise, sometimes they don't. At the very least, the voice-overs are in sync.  That's the good news. The bad news is that the gameplay is massively dated. After having played games like XCOM, Men of War, Dawn of War 2, and Red Orchestra 1&amp;2, I cannot say I enjoy playing Full Spectrum Warrior. The premise is novel, squad-based combat, multiple fireteams, cover that actually acts like cover. However, the interface is bad and as a result, the game is not fun to play. The visual cues are poorly placed and hard to see and the controls are far from optimal.  The gameplay itself is interesting, however, the locked camera view and clunky controls make it very difficult to efficiently order your fireteams around. This is especially problematic when making use of destructable cover as whole fireteams can be wiped out before you can get your soldiers into flanking positions. Furthermore, Marine marksmanship apparently counts for nothing, as no matter what, enemies in cover cannot be hit.  I wanted to like this game, but in the end the clunky controls and almost nonexistent GUI killed the experience for me. My recommendation? Find a paintball or airsoft field and play the real thing."
452000,Military Life: Tank Simulator,Its a dumb game about tanks. If you like army crap then get it on sale like I did.
452060,Caveblazers, Early Access Review
452120,Midvinter,"Very short point-and-click game based on Swedish lore. I picked it up for Christmas Eve as the scene felt appropriate. Beautiful for those with an interest but not fully familiar with Swedish folktales. It shows how they were talked of in daily life with the casual mention through the humans. The song in the video sums up the game beautifully well, I just wish it had been throughout the game. It has an old charm to it and the gnome guardian feels so pure hearted.  Be forewarned, once you finish playthrough 1, the 2nd and 3rd may be a breeze through for achievements depending on how much you accomplished your first have-at. Each ending is different and explains the future outcome of your choices. I grew up with these characters so to see them come to life is very interesting and exciting. The fact it was made by one woman in a span of 6 months begs high respect.   The art style feels traditional and beautiful which is what really grabbed my interest. Best for lore enthusiasts, Swedes who hold their heritage dear and perhaps children.   "

452640,Back to Dinosaur Island 2,"This should've been made more clear. You can only launch the game if you have a VR headset. All the application does when it starts up, is launch me to a black screen that eventually says 'Crytek'. The application is then unresponsive, and then crashes. I've read on other Steam forums. A plenty of other people have the same problem as well. Don't waste your time with this game if you don't have a VR headset."
452650,The Rebel, Early Access Review
452710,Realities,"Good, but so few realities to visit. Its good but lasts 40 minutes."
452860,Mad Bullets,"Very enjoyable rail shooter. Only one graphic resolution available:1024X768. There are 3 basic intro rails, with about 5 subrails, should you survive the intial trip through. You collect gold by shooting barrels and then shooting money signs, but beware. Some barrels contain bombs which you definitily don't want to shoot because they will cost you a life. Shoot enemies before they shoot you, and free captives by shooting the locks they are bound with. You also get points for shooting beers in the hand of the barkeep and shooting incoming projectiles. But some innocent folk will find their way in your path. Killing them is costly.  Shooting is accomplished by using the left mouse button, and reloading is done by using the right mouse button or the space bar. I found using the space bar easier.  There are 5 modes to the game: -Classic - no reload time. Can earn extra lives in barrels, if found. About 10 percent of enemies fire at you, and you have to shoot down the projectile, or lose a life. -Hardcore - enemies are very deadly with many more shooting at you. -Hyper - the speed of your movement, enemy movement, enemy shooting, and projectiles increase steadly. -Zen - no reload time. You are invincible, but only have 3 minutes to shoot as many bad guys, and save as many good guys as possible. - Time Attack - fill the time bar by shooting objects.  The game also provides goals that can be achieved, earning gold, and has a shop to spend your hard earned gold in, buying various upgrades.  This is a fun game in small doses. The graphics are of the comic variety, but are clean and easy to play in. You won't spend a solid hour playing this game, but if you have up to 15 minutes, this is quite enjoyable.  Recommended."
452920,Laser Disco Defenders,  ohh its a great game...definitely worth playing...
452930,Insane,"Nostalgy disappointed! I did pick it because i was/'m a huge fan of the old game Logical. I did played it on Dos numerous time back in the days and again recently... Yeah the concept is quite the same but that stops there.   Logical : graphisms were ok back in the day, the game was quick even frenetic. Logical was very responsive, animations were fast and you did launch the balls with one button and turn the wheels another one. Numerous levels.   Insane : Graphisms are really average to poor for today, they would fit better 10 years ago. this game is reaaaaally slow, balls are slow but the rest is even slower. It give the feeling that you're playing in thick jelly. It uses only one button so when you click you never really know if you're gonna launch a ball or turn a wheel and that leads to many many 'ghaaaaa that's wasn't what I wanted to do'. I can't tell about the music quality because it did bore me quickly and turn it off when i was only 10 min in.   I would have liked to tell something positive about this game but I got nothing. If you want something similar you better go find the original Logical, you'll have more fun.  If you do have it for free or really want to give it a try, go dual screen and put yourself a movie or something to watch at the same time. In all the other cases, keep your money for something else, it's absolutely not worth it."
452970,Asemblance,"Horribly disappointed after seeing a handful of articles praising this 'game'. Got all but the   white shift   ending without even trying (in less than an hour). After reading the requirements for the final ending, I said 'screw it' and quit."
4530,Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers,"Great game! Touchy and unpredictable as ever, just like I remember it on the PS2.  * Some pieces of cover are totally useless. Others that you'd expect to be useless appear to be made out of an impenetrable 12 inch thick piece of unobtanium, but this is only for the AI enemies... naturally.  * Units often can't hit the broad side of a barn on their own, allowing whole parades of enemy soldiers to run by in the open and start flanking you.  * Firefights while in cover happen at perfectly timed back and forth intervals of firing, ducking, firing, reloading, firing, ducking, on and on and on. Nothing is ever accomplished if you don't flank, frag or throw the dice with an aimed shot.  * Soldiers will pause a few seconds before carrying out any order, no matter what it is, and will often pause multiple times while they do. Picking up wounded soldiers is the best example of this. Order a squaddie to do it and he gets up and pauses, goes to the wounded soldier and pauses, picks him up and pauses, turns and pauses, maybe he'll pause a couple times while he's carrying him, too. Dragging is the same thing. They'll run right out into enemy fire and stand there for 2-3 seconds before they start dragging. They almost always get shot. And if a unit gets shot just one time in this game, he's out of the fight. Maybe there's a replacement at the CASEVAC point, and maybe there's not.  It's really disgusting and this pausing problem will account for about a third your deaths throughout the game. Another third will come from cover that doesn't work or aimed shots that never go off.  * The last third will come from trying to 'hot move', breach buildings that have a single enemy in it that will pick off an entire 4 man squad, and grenades that don't follow their arc but instead bounce off walls or cover and land back in your lap.  But, you know what? This is still an awesome game. It really is! It's awesome because there's no other game like it. It's old, though, and it looks old but it's not terrible. Works well on Windows 7 64bit but you have to run it in compatibility mode or your profiles won't save after you close the game. Also, you have to limit it to running at 60FPS or the death cam won't work right and will happen in super slow-motion. Controller compatibility is fine but the game lists the buttons as numbers instead of whatever your controller uses. There's a guide to decipher them.  It is a really good game if you can look past it's faults and it's a lot of fun once you've figured out how to deal with them. It has great mechanics (when they work right) and you have a huge level of control over your squaddies. It's a slow paced game, though. It's not even a first person shooter. More like the mutant child of Arma and Dawn of War 2 in a 3rd person perspective.  But I won't lie. This is the sort of game you need to find somewhere else first and see how you like it before you spend any money on it. "
45300,Wings of Prey,"Stay away! Don't buy this game because you need to log in to a stupid YU play account. It kills your router and you can't reconnect to the internet until you restart all your hardware. If you can take that buy a joystick, impossible to play without on realistic and simulator difficulty settings. Oh and multiplayer is totaly dead."

453270,Madness Cubed,This Game Is horrible Graphics Even the Trailer is enhanced the graphics are terrible mouse sensitivite is horrible and you have to pay Real money to get coins in this game and Half of the game is in russian/syrian  OVER ALL MULTIPLAYER: BAD GRAPHICS ;BAD SINGLEPLAYER BAD ;BAD  TOTAL OF WASTE OF MONEY on game YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET PIXEL GUN 3D FOR FREE ON A TABLET IT'S FREE AND WAY MORE FUN AND BETTER MULTIPLAYER
453290,Awareness Rooms,"Okay so this is complicated. I wouldn't actually reccomend it, but it's also not a negative review. I would reccomend this game if it's on a big sale, I wouldn't pay more than $1 for this though.   Pros:  Cute art Cute opening theme Nice concept  Cons: Puzzles make no sense No story No music in the actual game Not much sound at all really Mechanics are a little messy Ending made me really sad about the $5 I spent on this game. I was expecting a little closure as to anything that happened, but nope.  The ending is literally   'and it was all a dream'.  "
453300,A Healer Only Lives Twice,"In the few MMORPGs I've played, I've loved being a healer, supporting the front lines from the back. I thought this title sounded exciting and well, perhaps with it's simple UI / graphics, I could still find the engagement and excitement from being the healer who saves the day. Sometimes, I am just a bit too optimistic.  The gameplay is very clunky. The controls didn't seem clear, the inventory / crafting didn't make sense. The potential upgrades for the character didn't seem exciting to work for. I dunno, I only put 15 mins into it, gained a few levels and then died, but I am just really not interested in going back. Requested refund."
453340,Hustle Cat,"Art: 8/10, tons of cgs, tho some of them had room for improvement  Music: 10/10, it even has its own animated intro when you get past the prologue! Def wanna buy the soundtrack  Story: 10/10! For a visual novel on the shorter side, it definitely settles you in and establishes yourself as Avery, dedicated employee at The Cat's Paw! While the main drive of the story is of course the romance, It doesn't just focus on the romance, and gives you a proper setting for the romance driven plot to stick and drape itself onto. The writing ends up having filler at times, but its easy to overlook and doesnt get in the way of enjoying the story.  "
453350,Vaccine War,"I like the feel of the game, but there are bugs which break the game. My character constantly stops being able to move. . . in a metroid vania, being unable to move laterally is pretty much a death sentence. Meh."
453390,Dark Parables: The Little Mermaid and the Purple Tide Collector's Edition,great game!worth every penny!glad i bought it.
453480,Shadowverse,"I can't say enough about this game and its Dev team. They are the most generous and unique of all card games I have ever played. I have gotten more packs for free 'just because' in a few weeks than I did in a year of hearthstone. I don't find myself having to be a slave to the metadecks and have easily found success with my own, clumsy creations. This is something much harder to obtain in Hearthstone ranked.  On top of it all, this game is FUN. It is just so fun. Despite some similarities the differences are enough to keep you interested. I haven't logged onto the big H since and I will never go back. I've willingly spent money on this game already on silly cosmetics card backs and hero avatars. I don't regret it for a moment. This game gets a 10/10 from me."
453510,One Man Is Not No Man,"TL;DR Unique Idea, repeitive gameplay. Feels like a newgrounds flashgame, worth the money (kinda). Something's missing.  I think this game needs improvement, seeing that there's only five enemy types. The health seems perfectly balanced, though. So I don't really care about the hordes upon hordes of enemies.   All in all, I think this game deserves a sequel. It's worth the four bucks for its unique style and gameplay, but rewards aren't exactly something that will keep driving everyone back to play more and more of this game.  What I'd say is, if that there's more things. Maybe more enemy types, more classes, more areas, maybe skills. I don't know. I don't make games.  All in all, I'd say it's (kind of) worth the money, if it's at a huge discount. (E.G PAST %25 OFF), I'd reccomend it. And if you have some spare change lying around, I'd say go for it. But alone, as it is. It feels like there's something missing. I even beat the game in one go, not going past %50 HP.   I rate it 6/10 Kevin Bacons. It's not even close to being 'meh', but it's not close to being fantastic or bad. Indie games have done way better, and have been way bigger. Reach for the stars, and you'll make a better game. And I'll be there to buy it.   (Jim F. Ing. Sterling army Represent.)  P.S, how did you guys make the soundtrack? E.G, what program did you make it in, if any. Did you make it by hand? I kind of dig it, but it is, too. Missing something."
453650,Marble Void,"There's physics-enabled blocks, completely customizable marbles, an in-game level editor, an endless mode, and an in-game currency without microtransactions. This is more than just a Marble Blast clone; need I say more?  EDIT: TO WHOEVER OF YOU THREE DISLIKED THIS REVIEW, I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL KILL YOU."
453660,Rogue Contracts: Syndicate,"Very interesting gameplay. I need to get the timing better. I keep getting shot close range! Anyhow, I wonder how fast I can beat this game."
453670,The Lost Souls,"Hey its kinda cute, its very short, but it is also very cheap, I always enjoy the creepy horror type games, I dont mind supporting this Indie dev a bit with buying this game. All text is very bad and broken english. But it dosent take much effort to know what is meant with these texts :) No crashes, good fps, wasent stuck anywhere.  Heres some gameplay  https://youtu.be/hJcPr8xRcBg "
453700,prog.1,"prog.1 is a very fun little puzzle/platformer. Each level has you collecting objects in the enviroment while the platforms beneath you are being corrupted by your character. The platforming feels good for the most part, but I felt at times the jumping was a little unresponsive or the momentum while jumping was inconsistant. (I was also playing on a keyboard, so your mileage may vary.) Overall though, a fun game that is for sure worth taking a look at."
453710,TableTop Soccer,Wait no pls  Add foxes thats all you need pls pls pls pls pls pls
453720,Last Will,"Interesting puzzles but...  I enjoyed my time with the game the puzzles are interesting if you suck at riddles theres always clues to be found, Playing with friends is great even if the graphics are meh at best.... but its absolutely riddled with bugs I spent a week waiting for 1 bug to be fixed so i could finish the last room in chapter 2 just to be stuck again because of another bug in chapter 3 ? Uninstalling for now I'll be back when its a little more cleaned up."
453740,Spaceman Sparkles 3,"It's a huge flop from the first game. A transition to 3D was a bad idea. VERY BAD.  The game consists of 10% Getting to the bosses and 90% Fighting the bosses. And I assure you that you'll either be raging or bored as ♥♥♥♥ for 95% of the time you play this game. It revolves around you... Well, revolving around a center point of gravity. Some times what surround that point is material you can stand on. Some times it's surrounded by two balls of water on opposite sides of each other. Or just water. You have many different ways of moving around this terrain. How well do these mechanics function? Pretty damn poorly. I'm a frequent player of Team Fortress 2, so I came into this game biased and used to a certain form of aerial movement. Though a good game will know how to get you associated with its movement system. Anyways, the quality of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog levels of transitions to 3D. There's not much good to say about it, excpet that it has good music. But that doesn't give you an excuse for making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Now, onto the bad things.  The first three inch thorn stuck in my big toe is getting to the bosses. Dear god is it tedious. Some platforms are so difficult to get to, it comes down to spinning around the panet that you revolve around and hoping to god you somehow land on one. Though this isn't that bad, since the game puts you straight back into the action when you die, but it's still so annoying. It can take 15 Minutes to get to the boss. Not going through an action packed level or being taken through an intriguing story. Just looping around a planet, trying to get onto a foot long platform while at Mach 4. An when you finally get to it, you're treated to a hardcore BDSM room, Who's on top? That depends on the boss.  Yes, the bosses. The footlong porcupine quill stuck into your chest. Some lay on the table and strap themselves in, crying for punishment. Others shove you onto it and make a lamp post come out the other side of you like a rotisserie chicken. The prior kind of bosses are so easy, it comes down to holding down three buttons for about 5 minutes. No need to prepare this scenario. It's that simple. The latter bosses are ♥♥♥♥ing insane, They either keep you in an cramped space or have attacks that are so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to dodge, and may I add you can only get hit three times. And even after five minutes of arbotrary button holding or hours of trying to dodge those attacks that literally made a hole in your wall, directly or not, You have to deal with something else. A boss after that boss.  Yes, the heart shaped vortex. The dog that's finished eating your reproductive organs and is going to your brain for some dessert. This thing shot the chance of a good game in the leg. This thing rapid fires large green orbs I can only identify as sea urchins and makes rods come out of the terrain. May I also mention that it seems to have a lot more health than the actual boss. Just imagine it. It's taken you so long to defeat a boss. You finally take away its last heart, only for the game to say 'Nope, ♥♥♥♥ you. You have to fight another one. Oh, you failed? Well do it all again.' I never finished the game. Because I am not a masochist. I am a sadist, but definitely not a masochist. Even Dark Souls veterans wouldn't and shouldn't beat this game. It is a pile of crap that does nothing but make a mockery of what Spaceman Sparkles 3 could have been.    "
453750,Tyto Ecology,"I'm really enjoying this game, but I'm experiencing pretty bad mouse lag. Anyone else having this issue? Or know how to solve it perhaps? I've tried my trackpad and an external mouse but both are jerky and laging. Someone help."
453770,Forgotten Tales: Day of the Dead,"Super cute game with an endearing story line. The art work is great, They do several fun things during game play to make it fun. It's a smooth, well thought game and it's uniqueness (artwork, story line) make it distinctive from others and worth playing. I really enjoy it."
453780,Secrets of Magic: The Book of Spells,"fun little match 3 with good upgrades, 100% in 10H"
453790,Candice DeBébé's Incredibly Trick Lifestyle,"This game is evidence that Steam desperately needs quality control. This game is disgusting in every sense of the word. The dialogue is painful, the music is an attack on your ears, the graphics are appaling. There are no redeeming qualities to this absolute horror show"
453810,Blasting Agent: Ultimate Edition,"Blasting Agent, although it has a simple/pretty pixel look, has extremely challenging bosses. It took me awhile to beat the 2nd boss, but on normal mode the 4th boss has stopped me in my tracks... If I tried this game on hard, I probably wouldn't even get passed the first boss. If you dont have some upgrades in normal for the first boss, you will get killed really quick. If you are looking for a SUPER CHALLENGING GAME this is it...10/10 &lt;( '-' &lt;)"
453820,Hero Quest: Tower Conflict,Not a nice game!
453830,Innoquous 5,"I picked this up for a mere fifty cents during the Steam sale, but I reckon it is worth the full five bucks.  My friend recommended this game, he loves it. And I see why. I was pleasantly surprised when I played this the first time. Good graphics and style? Check. Nice soundtrack? Check. Precise controls? Yup.  A buttload of content?  Indeed! There are, as of now, 175 levels, each of which can be completed in five or six different game-modes. And to top it off, most of the game feels nice and polished.  I've got a couple gripes so far; the controls feel kinda 'cheap', but that's because they need to be precise, so not really a problem. I had to turn all settings down, and even then I didn't manage to reach 60 FPS, sometimes getting annoying lag spikes. This is not really a problem either, more so a warning for those with slower computers. Last of all; I would really like to have the ability to go to the options menu while in-game.  All in all, a very decent game, with a bunch of content and a nice feel. 4/5"
453850,Dear RED - Extended,I got the game out of curiousity in the SALE. But I wouldn't recommend it.  It looks nicely done and the story do seem interesting. Yet I took 10 second (this is NO JOKE) to get my first ending. And yes I red everything. No skipping.   The other endings are as easy to gain as the first one and the story is rather confusing. You have to play it several times to understand even a little what's going on. In my first run (the 10 seconds) I didn't even understood in the slightest what was going on.
453880,Ninja Outbreak,"Released last September but recently making an appearance on the new releases list on Steam, Ninja Outbreak is a step back into gaming’s past. The game’s pixel graphics, the way in which it tells its story, its presentation and its sound remind me of the type of games that I played on the Commodore 64. As an occasionally proud retro gamer this can be a very good thing. In the case of Renegade Sector Games’ title I have to admit to being more than a little torn. In a number of ways I am deeply attracted to the game yet in others I feel detached and questioning whether I made the right choice in featuring the game.  This may be because I never did get around to playing the under appreciated Venusian Vengeance even though the game has long been in my Steam library. As such I have no connection to the game – which is an indirect sequel, arguably more of a spin off. Therefore there is an understandable disconnect to the game even if I have been advised that you don’t need to have played this game in order to have a good time playing this one. There is a genre difference between the two games as well as this is a classically styled survival horror game.  If you are the type of player that retrieves most of their story through cut scenes and prefers not to read journal entries, computer terminals and the like then you would easily be forgiven for having ignored the storyline. But there is one and it is up to you to find it. As this could be a game breaker for a large number of players it is something that has to be stated. I am personally on the fence in regards to stories being told in this fashion. It works very well as a tool for games that the player finds deeply engrossing because you want to investigate everything and read everything while for other games it can have the opposite effect.  There is something on the in game sounds that I wanted to make a mention of but it was more of a candid observation than anything critical. Have you ever played the original Ghostbusters game that was on the Commodore 64? I haven’t heard that typing sound in a video game since and the sound as writing comes up on the screen in dialogue reminds me of it.  This is a game where you are going to die a lot and will appreciate the save points when you find them. It is also a game where you are going to want to be someone who conserves their ammunition because it can occasionally be very few and far between. You wont necessarily know when and where it is scarce so it is in your best interests to be both a scrounger and less trigger happy. Enemies can prove to be ruthless and you may at times feel as though the AI is too strong but it’s not supposed to be easy – which it is at other times.  Ninja Outbreak has the potential to be considered an outstanding game for some players. I know that several of my friends who played it when it was in Greenlight were as eager to play the full release as any game that they had come across in recent times.

453890,Black Rose,"The graphics were ok, but the textures were re-used a lot.  There isn't a lot in the way of lighting.  There isn't enough attention to detail, most hallways and rooms are near empty.  Partial controller support? If dialogue appears on screen you have to use the mouse to accept.  Having to start over if you die on story mode is a good concept, but not being able to run 'Through' or 'Shove' the thing you're running from and dying as a result isn't so good.  Not a fan of the 'Telescope' vision gimmick.  If it had some form of outside weather coming through the windows... lightning storm or something.  Overall the game runs very smoothly and could definetly be improved with some more work on it, I cant see why it has very positive reviews at the moment it is particularly lackluster."
453960,Envy the Dead,"At the moment i have played just over 7hours on this game and i think it is great... BUT... There are alot of problems with the game. when you are in a fight it is really hard to get your team to do what you want. at one point i had 5 members of my team against 1 foe and we lost. this was because the commands didnt work and they stood still. When this happens you can save yourself by pressing ESC and then going back into the game but by doing this you lose everything you had in your invo for example, walls, barrels, tank etc. IT IS A PAIN!!!...  Another problem i have had is you can on to the exit zones and click 'not now' so you will be on that spot but wont leave just yet... this is great if you change your mind but if you do this on both exits... your never getting out because it dosent think you ever want to leave. you might as well kill yourself and start again. Would i recommend the game... i would say no. i have played over 7 hours and i have to start again because of the above problems. not a good way to spend your weekend."
453980,Airstrike HD,  This game shouldn't be on steam. Period. 
453990,Mibibli's Quest,"An ACTUAL retro inspired game. You know those games you see that are 'retro inspired,' but it's just some procedurally generated zombie survival lazy pixel art game? This game is none of that. Mibibli's Quest feels like i'm playing an actual NES game. Great chiptune music. Level design you'll remember, (whether you like it or not, this game will force you to learn the levels to a tee.) It has the element of NES difficulty, the stages themselves are only a couple minutes long, but the difficulty makes it longer. However, every death feels like your fault. The only level I could remember with mechanics that made me feel like it was the game's fault was Digitaland. Screw Digitaland.  All in all, great game if you like retro inspired games, a kickass chiptune soundtrack, and a good challenge."
45400,Fortix,"This game really sucks, theres lots of other great games that has way more to it, it feels like you are in an empty world with noone and all you do it play this game.. only reason to buy this game is to make it so you can sell and trade on steam with your account. I dont even care if it has multiplayer or not, a game like this doesnt fit anything. Simply just go play some other game. And no, not cod."
454030,Link,"This game was a pleasent surprise for me. The game was alot more nuanced than alot of the people give it credit for. Now, I paid about a buck for this game, and it was very worth it. Is it worth $5? Eeh.... maybe?   This game plays as a series of short campaigns. You build, you manage resources and you send characters on tactical missions, but before long you either succeed or fail the campaign. If you succeed you get points to unlock new characters for the next campaign. It's unforgiving, but if you lose, you aren't losing much because the games are short. Either way, you notice things you could improve in your next game.  The tactical element is not immediately intuitive but is interesting. The stamina system lets you overexert your characters at the cost of future actions, and does it very smoothly. Mistakes here can get characters killed in a hurry. The system is complex without being cumbersome.   The base-building is surprisingly nuanced as well. You start off with practically nothing and there's a very sharp growth curve that you have to keep up with, or you get overwhelmed.   Rogue-likes this unforgiving are usually too stressful to be fun for me, but since the length is short it's much less frustrating than losing a run of, say, ToME or Don't Starve. It feels like a fun challenge, rather than a game that makes you scared to take risks. I think Desktop Dungeons is the only other game to really pull that off.   Not a huge amount of content, but definately worth a couple bucks. No bells and whistles on the presentation, but if you can see past the graphics the game itself is solid."
454060,Blueprint Tycoon,"So I got this game after seeing Markiplier play the game. It was fun at first, the tutorial looked fun... But then when they threw me into the real thing the only problem I had was feeding the Workers. The more workers you have the more you they eat but for some reason even when I had over 22 vegtables in the Market the Workers were too lazy to get their food fast enough and when they starve your reputatoin goes down and when it is below 50 the Workers will refuse to work. Don't get the game it is impossible to beat."
454070,Boundel,  Do you recommend this game?
454080,Burst,"i only have one problem, the ogg only which is extremely annoying!!!!! The games super adictive tho. of course i listen to top with this :8bitheart:"
45410,Ignite,"I am very dissapointing for this game,Because driving mechanism not good enough, sounds and musics bad, graphics is kind a ok and generally game is boring."
454100,Dungeon Escape,i really dont like the soundtrack
454130,Nil-Ninjahtic: Ronin,"Nil-ninjhatic ronin is a fun game, it holds up the fun and difficulty very well! Still retaining that great music from the previous games, fun parkour sections, fair difficulty, and style. i have some gripes about it though. First, the new stage system is an ok idea on paper, but doesnt work as well in the game, when you select a stage it takes you to the start of the stage, the problem is that if you need to go somewhere or close the game, all the stuff you went through to get far into the stage is worth nothing becuase you cant simply save. secondly, yes some music tracks return but i see a lack of new ones and this might be becuase there very forgetable which is a shame cus you can make really good tracks. finally, combat was a big part of ninjhatic mind tricks, and i liked how you tried to combine it with the older style of gameplay, but it favors the original more than mind tricks. you can't attack up or down which sucks when you need to attack enemies when hanging on a ledge, and you only take one hit no matter what! getting hit multiple times allowed you to not get ♥♥♥♥ed over by that one enemy in front of the door and made combat a bit more enjoyable, 2 hits would be perfectly fine, we dont need 5 hits or whatever it was in mind tricks.  but other than that everything is perfect! (note i didnt beat the game when i wrote this review) 9/10!"
454160,Dark Fear,"Fun and charming throwback to classic, Sierra-style adventure games from the late 80s. Even including the classic white score bar at the top of the screen! You click around and try to solve the mystery of where you are and why you woke up there, by collecting clues, pushing evil spirits out of their haunted houses and interviewing the residents of a small village. This part is all good and enjoyable, especially if you're oldschool enough to have played some of the game that inspired this one.  The problem is that the story is pretty bad, including possibly the worst twist of all time. You shouldn't burst out laughing at the twist in a horror game, which I did. Second, the game goes too far with its economy and forces you to stop and grind at several points in the game. If the hunting and fishing minigames had actually been fun, that wouldn't have been a problem, but it's a ridiculously simple system that must feel shallow even on mobile.  Adventuring and solving mysteries with clues is the good part of this game, and there is a decent amount of it, but the game is weighed down by the grinding and in-game economy. I wish Steam had a neutral option here, because I'd place this game squarely in that category; fun if you can tolerate grinding, probably not worth it if you don't want to 'hunt' in a simple minigame for hours. Since the neutral option doesn't exist, I'm gonna have to go with a 'not recommended' because of the grinding."
454180,CrazyCars3D,"A hilariously bad game. Terrible controls, ugly graphics, incredibly repetetive, slow pace. Unless you want the cards don't bother."
454190,Cubicolor,"A small, peaceful puzzle game. There’s not a great deal of content here, but it’s fairly priced and the calm ambience makes it an excellent game to relax with.  Small Note: If you uninstall the game (or even verify the game cache), your progress will be wiped, as the save files are stored in the install folder. However, it’s very easy to find the save state file and manually edit it to restore any lost progress."
45420,Land It!,  It's a good game anyone who want to practicing the shared concentrating.
454200,Neon Hardcorps, Early Access Review
454220,The Temporal Invasion,"Great game for those who like riddles, playing detectives, conspiracies and are not discouraged because of alt+tabing the game to google real information or find web pages made only for the game purpose. That's awsome! That's something I play for the first time and I want more games like that.  Plus it's linux playable!"
454230,SLG Remix,"  This is a visual novel where all you do is click to go foward. There are no choices, no scares, and the writing is like sub-parr creepypasta. The game is all tell, no show, and even though it tell you everything, it still is a convoluted mess. And the graphics are just... something.   Despite the game's lack of gameplay, the game still has a bug in it. If you're playing the game in steam's onlline mode, the game will occasionally close steam in the background, somehow. It's annoying if you're trying to show it to your friends via steam brodcast.  This game took about 30 minutes to play, so if you really want to subject yourself to this for whatever reason, you'll be well within the time limit it takes to refun it."
454250,The Eyes of Ara,"I'm afraid I didn't get very far with this one. I didn't realise it was a click to move game, you know - old style.  The puzzles were.  The graphics weren't.  The story was.  The music really, really wasn't.  As a pointy, clicky, where do I go nexty thing it was OK. Maybe I only played the tutorial, but I already played the Rooms."
454320,[the Sequence],"Starts easy, grows gradually more difficult, just like most puzzle/logic games like this.  But then it just jumps right into the complex dimension, throwing setups that seem impossible at first, having to (ab|re)use modules on each other in really unexpected ways and tweaking timings carefully. And seems I'm just about half way through...  I like a lot."

454420,Mini Metal,It's simple and small game but control was smooth and gameplay was engaging. Good one for killing time.
454430,Crystal Chip Collector,"THis is actually a pretty challenging, pretty fun puzzle platformer. I've gotten through a small chunk of the game, and I quite liked what I saw so far. It's pretty well polished, too."
45450,Fortix 2,Great little time waster game that can run on just about any hardware.
454510,Substance Painter 2,"Only 1.5 hours of use and encountered 2 bugs to report. This does not bode well. Bug 1: Two grey material screens show up for no reason and cover actual view of 3D obj model and the actual material windows. Problem recurred only when creating new paint layers. Other types of layers were fine.   Bug 2: Paint turned translucent as if an alpha channel or masking occurred. No alpha channel, no masking, no special brushes, etc were in use. Could not paint or erase weird coloring of one layer obj model. Only reloading mesh and starting over worked.  With 2 bugs within 2 hours, I can't give a thumbs up on this yet.. Will edit this when I see solutions."
454520,MilitAnt,"After playing a while and testing and trying to get into this game, the basic idea and level design is nice and definitely worth a look. But there are so many annoying beginner developer flaws - and not sure if they are going to be fixed soon. Those flaws make this game entirely annoying and completely unfair. I love challenging games, but this one here feels wobbly and has quite imprecise controls. Especially a game where you need to be in absoutely full control of your perfect double jumps and reactions. I play with a Razer Wildcat and never had any problem with other platformers (except the bad designed ones). Not with this game: Double Jumps are 100% random - and when your first jump turns out to be accidentally 'double' and you jump into dangerous vines this is simply not fun.  These frustrating experiences have a really bad taste. If I manage to finish a level it's not like I think I played good - but just had some luck in a series when the controls did not suck that much.  It's more like a relief to hope when this game finally ends since I paid for it and did not want to quit quite early. Then another thing: this is obviously not a Rogue-like game, because it has several checkpoints. Why the hell you need to start from the beginning of the entire level when you exit and restart the game? I mean if I need to leave and want to come back at a later time I don't intend to play the entire level, but eventually just the boss where I stopped at the SAVE-mark.  So the solution would be to pause the game, don't shut down computer and play the next day? Don't tell me this is intended. All those things made me stop this game at Behemoth-boss. I will surely never continue and delete it. That's why I would not recommend. Too many great games here on Steam to bother with something like that. "
454530,Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa,"I would say this is one of the most underrated war games of all times.   Yes, this is a real war game, not Call of Duty or some such thing, in that it focuses on the difficulty of command. You are part of the command chain, and upsetting your superiors, or even subordinates, can derail your campaign just as easily as picking the wrong units, locations and time to attack.  And, unlike much of the other stuff out there, the AI is very competent.  Overall, a fantastic game, that is unfortunately way underrated."
454540,LuckCatchers,"So hey all! i wanted to add my little tid bit to the forums. I would recommend this game because of the battles that ive had within the game.the combat is really good. best ive ever had when you actually get to have them and support them. and ive seen where they are going with it and i like it. im talking massive Steampunk Battles between Al-tonas (Empire) and Port (Pirates) including 20-50 ships each side. really this is the one reason i like this game.  that being said now here comes the parts to look out for.   1) Russians have been playing this game for years. they have both advantage and money. (including most good lots.) and yes they have the new ship. I can only look on with Awe...   2) The new implemented rules make it very hard for someone to just try the game beyond short newb runs. not that it can't be done, but good luck earning your first settlement. 10000G and thats does not include the Planner skill what is required now to make a settlement. on that note I just did some testing on a Dodger and a Corsair and made about 2000-4000 a day on runs. so at best a week or two should do the trick ,, maybe more. so if you can Ace out the learning curve and learn do trade you can get started on the long upgrade for that settlement. youll need lots and lots of resources to upgrade one.  3) Rogue jobs, yup theres still there. just make sure you're going from city to city till you can weed out the bad ones.  4) Strekolets, are the plane like aircraft of the game, yup they crash. ive found 3 reasons to have them.  a, torpedo shooting ..(yes my favorite) just watch as your torps hit or miss target. YAY!!! b, Stealing ships (ive tried many times to to never have actually stolen a ship).  c, faster travel to far sites, in when you might just crash anyway. havent tried the racing. its always been too buggy for me to invest in it.  5) PTW yup. they want your money. have i invested? Yup, will I now? Cant. but i have invested about as much as a would if i played WOW for a few months. ill give them that. you can come in with about 100-120 smackaroos and get the best scout ship in the game. (dont lose it) hahaha...    lets go a bit deeper here. ive found that older players have hundreds of settlements and you will struggle to get just one. to feeseably maintain your fleet you'll need oil, metal, wood, and dragon parts ect ect... this is to maintain your ships with fuel armor ect.. ect.. unless your helped you wont find a spot that has all that. you may, id bet you wont. you need 3 types put on correct locations.  a, All purpose Settlement. 10000g gets everything in small to medium doses b, Mine. 65000g the amount you get from one is good enough to meet your needs for metal .. for now. c, Well or Platform. 65000g if you are ever going to expand to tier 2-3 ships you will need fuel. d, Sawmill, 65000g wood much? f, Castle. 85000g i dont have one. but if you plan on building a fleet - clan - really becoming anything more then solo then you will need it in the end.  you could also just be a pirate and live on the island. its profitable maybe enough to maintain a 200 if you do it right. its a long shot though.  if you can make it past all that.. theres more.   Recently Ive lost many friends who have invested much into this game, its Quiet now. Mainly just Bots and a Handful of players. Its too bad because the combat has been great. ill keep playing . i really feel they need a new model for the economics of the game. concept is great, very Eve like in a steampunk world. a good translation of the book would give this game more meaning. My fear is that I may go down with this ship. hope you found this helpful.   "
454550,Qubicle Voxel Editor,"This is a good software for making voxel stuffs. I prefer it a lot more than other free voxel editors that you can find online because this has the ability to move models around while all loaded at once.   I personally wouldnt buy the dlcs because i dont need them for what i use this for (modding trove).  Its sad that all the old reviews are negative and newer good reviews arent good enough to boost it back overall to positive, its a great voxel editor once you know how to use it :D  And dont forget to try out the demo first. it shows accurately what is included :)"
454560,Ultimate Fight Manager 2016, Early Access Review
454570,I Am Caligula,Short but interesting. Has the main hype events but lacks any depth in the misunderstood truth of Caligula and why he actually did those things (he was sticking it to the man/establishment(senate) and trying to out do Tiberius legacy.). Worth a playthrough. Nice artwork.
454600,Age of Cavemen,nice graphics
454610,Demon's Crystals,"  Game was recieved as a gift. The store page shows Coop / Multiplayer, yet it should show 'Local Coop / Local Multiplayer.  We had to refund the game because of this. Perhaps something to add for the future."
454650,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,"Awsome game, already got 15 hours down over a few days.  One of the best fighting games ever made around the DBZ universe into a hybrid MMO. "
454670,Piggy Princess,this game me sad 10/10
454690,Cyber City 2157: The Visual Novel,"For a visual novel, the concept of the visual is actually kinda different from what you would expect of the famous visual novels.  It feels a lot like a classic sci-fi novel in some sense, specially the images that are used.  I feel the game is a bit overpriced, tho. In a sale it may be worth it for, at least, half the price. The game has some bad english, which is not really a problem, but may be annoying for some. The music doesn't help too, it makes the game a little bit sleepy. But the story has something into it.  Again, this game is for those who are interested in VN, also noting that it is not the usual animelike VN. But, still, you should probably get it in a sale."
454720,RAM BOE,A very basic puzzle game with nice graphics and sound. I would have preferred a much simpler version that didn't require me to wait ages for the ram to move around. I think 90% of my time was spent just waiting for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to move!
454730,World Of Undead,"After some updates and improvements I have lot of fun with the 'Multiplayer Coop Campaign'. First I play it alone and was frusted with the very hard gameplay, but when I play it in 'Coop Mode' with three other people and unlocked some weapons and gadgets, I could not stop playing :-) Yes, it´s not an 'AAA' title, but it´s not bad and I have bought the game for 9.99 $ and I do not regret it. I 've been playing for six hours and I haven´t done it for half  - very much action - a lot of fun - I like the game :-) "
454780,Atriage,"It's basically CHESS! IN SPACE!  You can imagine the gameplay. There are set 4 classes of ships and each ships move different and attack differently, and you fight in a 2 dimensional board with random obstacle.  My feedback for now is that I wish there's more options on the visual (like for example to reduce the thickness of the board lines).  Also, I guess I must reiterate again. It's Chess In Space with a bit of random elements. Gurgeh would be proud. So there aren't any campaign or storyline or upgrades or fleet building or such. I guess I should recommend it at discount for those who aren't really into chess."

454890,Project Starship,worth the grind for 4th place.  10/10  would shoot so many bullets i lag to hell again
454900,Amaranthine,"Not very difficult really. You may need to repeat a couple of levels early on to get your armour and weapons suitably upgraded, but once you've got adequate armour and weapons you're pretty much unstoppable. The unusual mouse control pretty much allows you to zip to any spot on the screen instantaneously making avoiding enemy projectiles pretty easy, and even if you do get hit it won't bother you much if you've been upgrading your armour.  There's a variety of weapons, but the differences are mostly cosmetic as they all shoot straight forward. One has a small scatter arc, and one shoots through enemies, but really there's no real strategy to selecting weapons aside from going for the maximum damage per second you have points for.   The warp sections were fun and challenging, just beware that if you fail, that's it. Early in the game it's worth taking the risk, but later in the game you'll have pretty powerful weaponry anyway.  Randomly generated attack waves keep things interesting, but after a few levels you've seen all the enemies the game will throw at you, you just keep going against the same foes each level only slightly powered up. There are couple of sub-boss type enemies to keep things interesting, but these won't offer much more challenge than the rest of the enemies.  Won't take you very long until you've beaten the boss on hard mode. I can take him fairly easily between level 20-30. I did have a little fun with this, but don't think I can recommend it. Oh, and it has an unskippable intro, I hate those.  6.9/10"
454970,Gravity Den,i dont like the movement
455000,The Lost,"The fact that you guys released this game with only its first 3 chapters without letting the buyer know it's incomplete and full of bugs nor any mention of 'early access' is in my opinion very unethical. I have came across multiple bugs where I had to restart in order to continue. Some of these may also lead players to think what they're trying to do is wrong and look elsewhere while in fact it was correct but the game is not acting right. Chapter 3 I was stuck for quite long because the game failed to show me all the controls, I had to test out random keys on the keyboard 1 by 1 in chapter 3 to use umbrella. I played through the whole thing in English and there are times information were given in Chinese. I can only say that this game at its current state is unacceptable as an official release game."
455080,Awakening: The Redleaf Forest Collector's Edition,when i brought today i thought they had trading cards but in badges they don't have.
455110,Pertinence,"I'm not really sure whether to recommend this game or not; it's definitely much more action-y than puzzle-y (at least in my opinion). Several of the rooms require perfect or near-perfect timing, and most of the puzzles either require a large amount of precision themselves, or are based on trial-and-error, or are extremely easy. If that's your thing, then go for it. If you're looking for something in the style of Legend of Zelda, however... I'd recommend looking elsewhere. I, personally, didn't really enjoy it much, so I've marked it as thumbs down, but that's mainly because it just wasn't what I figured it would be."
455120,Stay Close,im sorry....was stoked 4 this game..and....my wife dosent look like the wife in the vid and i dont even get to be in the house... sorry game makers. but its a no from me. and a refund request...
455160,PaintLab,"For a free tool I can't complain. It's great fun and recommend it as a day 1 install before trying out tiltbrush. But the functionality is limited. I wanted to be able to export a 3d model that I'd drawn so that I could print it. I wanted to change the resolution of the blob I was drawing with so it was smaller/bigger (even if I had to make myself smaller/bigger). I wanted to switch the controls so they were left handed (ok, I managed that by switching which controller was where). Maybe these things are possible but I couldn't find a manual either."
455200,The Battle for Sector 219,"The instructions are a bit to wade through at the start, but once you get going this actually a prettty engaging little two-player strategy - the AI's no slouch either! The games are about 10 mins so I've been playing in between other stuff. Recommened and hope to see more good stuff from his developer."
455230,Bazaar,"Was gifted this game. You ride on a magic carpet on a mission to collect relics monkeys have stolen. You have to eat to stay alive, collect coins to buy stuff, collect arrows to use, use health to stay alive, avoid damage from various enemies including spraying water amongst other things. Use the umbrella to protect against spraying water. You look at what you are interested in and press trigger to grab or use. You can stand or kneel to play this because you do have to look around with your head a lot so sitting proabably is not recommended with VIVE. For the price it is a nice VR game experience. Reminds me of a rail ride at a carnival or hauntd house. It is good for the kids too I would say. Get it and hope the devs take all the good they have here and make an even better and bigger altogether new and different game. I have a video that is uploading so it will be ready to watch after it processes. The link will be below. Enjoy.           YouTube™ Video:  Bazaar VR Game -- Magic Carpet Ride&nbsp;"
455290,Dashing Dinos," https://youtu.be/WG2GZu6TJqY   (Dashing Dinos was featured in my youtube channel)  now onto the review    graphics, sound &amp; artstyle?  Dashing Dinos looks very beautiful, I found myself getting lost at times to the details and colors. Lost Mountain made an excellent job at producing something modern without having to resort to old school 8,16, 32 bit esque indie games. As for the sounds, while I found myself humming the only song in the game hours after playing, and found it cute as when you get certain powerups the dinos make a sound, it was just to repetitive. Some more music, maybe different tracks for the contrasting levels would have been nice but did not take my away from the experience.  gameplay?  Gameplay is absolutely simplistic as an indie game should be. It is a controller only game, but I have no problem with it as I use my gamepad for most games.There are various different game modes including, Deathmatch. Last Dino Standing. Splash Dash. Capture the Egg and Soccer. All of which (with the exception of one) are a fun and different approach to the game.   In Deathmatch one must kill other dinos by dashing into them, and try throwing them into thorns, lava or icicles.  Last Dino Standing gives you a limited amount of lives and must kill/survive a time limit.   Splash Dash pits you into an arena where the objective is to turn an egg into your color for an amount of time similar to King of the Hill. Only you dash your dino into it.  Capture the egg takes the form of capture the flag where 2 teams try to capture 3 of each others eggs.  Soccer, where dinos dash into a pitch and score on each other.  I can honestly say all of the game modes were a great time except for Capture the Egg. It was the most tedious game mode of all of them as most of the time, it resulted in death while trying to capture an egg as the floor is always slippery.     Whats the price?  The retail price for Dashing Dinos is 11.99 USD.    How many hours estimated?  As the game is a local multiplayer game, the amount of hours estimated for this game will require you to bring along friends, and with no bots option. Often times most gamers won't get to enjoy the game to its fullest potential  ESTIMATED: 7-14 hours of gameplay overall. 15-20 if more arenas come out.   Pros/Cons  -Pros 'easy controls. A to dash, and right stick to dash faster. 'extremely fun game modes 'SOCCER- oh what fun!!! 'Customizable characters 'Short &amp; Sweet matches 'Party Mode turns the game into a drinking game 'cute dinos 'great artstyle 'powerups change the scene of the game modes   -Cons 'local multiplayer only 'only 3 dinos 'limited amount of maps 'Capture the Egg game mode 'only 1 song 'no bots  Buy it, Wait for it to go on sale, Don't.  Well Dashing Dinos is certainly one of those games that will be in my repertoire when having friends over to my house. Its a game you can just pick up and play whenever you want, which is exactly what an arcade indie game should be. The lack of maps, dinos, local only and inability to add bots hurt the game quite a bit in my opinion but still an overall great experience. At retail price of 12 USD, you won't break your bank over the game however I recommend you WAIT FOR IT TO GO ON SALE. In my opinion I would have no problem paying $10 for it, but with the lack of options for people without friends and or people to play with constantly, it just isnt worth the 12 USD. Perhaps 7.50 USD would be more fair, even if the devs have an obviously polished game. This can change however with the addition of single player support. But to reiterate it is a great game, and I would have no problem paying full retail price, but I would be more inclined to buy it at a later time when and if the price lowers just a bit."
455340,"Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon - Da Orks","Absoluterly awful game, no wonder its cheap. Played warhammer games for years this is horrible, so slow and annoying."
455400,PAC-MAN 256,"A bunch of cool ideas lost in a sea of nonsense, gameplay-wise.  Pac-Man 256 has a working, if slightly boring and occasionally inconsistent, presentation, and didn't exhibit technical problems on my machine. The problem is with the gameplay. Genre-wise, it's a mix of an arcade game with an upgrade'a'thon, and it's hard to tell which part is supposed to be the side one.  If you try to ignore the upgrade'a'thon, you end up with a rather simple game where you lead Pac-Man amongst the neverending maze, with flood of glitched out glyphs preventing you from returning too far or completely slacking off. The ghosts have some interesting, unusual behaviors, probably tied down to the fact that you are in a neverending maze and not a closed one. You can also get 'dot combos' by collecting regular pellets without crossing over empty spaces. The thing is, the deciding factor on your score is what will the level generator come up with. A particular oddity is that game occasionally changes minor pellets into upgrade coins and powerups, and the way it works is that pellet disappears and a thing appears a moment later - the thing would keep up the pellet combo, but if pellet gets removed just as you were to collect it, your combo is broken. Add very random locations of powerups, ghosts, and lanes, and it really is a game of luck.  The upgrade'a'thon part hinges on additional powerups being introduced into the game. Here are the facts: you select three powerups that game will spawn randomly on the field. The power pellets are always spawned but share some mechanics with powerups, most notably that while under effect of a powerup the very same powerup will refill the duration as expected, but other ones will just refill a little of duration of current one, and you can't distibugish visually between other powerups until the current one wears off. You unlock selectable powerups by total of collected regular pellets, and you can upgrade them with upgrade coins, with first upgrade costing 16 upgrade coins and eigth one 2048 upgrade coins. The upgrade coins with value of 2 and 5 spawn rather rarely during gameplay, and there are also traditional missions granting you, randomly, 128/256/512/1024 upgrade coins on fulfillment; the game can also grant you such a reward for no apparent reason. Unlike most upgrade'a'thons with mission system that come to mind, you are only given one mission at a time.  Since regular pellets are placed at roughly same density, or even decreasing one, through the maze, there is little discouragement for dying in the first unlock system. You just grind for powerup selection. How are the upgrade coins? Not much better. Most missions involve collecting specific powerups or making use of them to kill ghosts which also implies collecting them, and there we get back into maze being rather random. The fact that you don't have a wider selection of missions at once also makes this quite annoying. They don't even get harder with time, they stay time-consuming, but that's it; you could probably fulfill all but one of them by playing the game for 20 seconds, intentionally dying, and repeating. At the same time, if you are past the last unlockable powerup and want to just get the upgrades, there is no reason at all to continue a game once you get a mission success prompt, since that's the only real way to get coins and you won't get another mission until acknowledging that one.  This would perhaps be forgivable if the new powerups actually revived the overrandomized main game. They do not.  The vast majority of unlockable powerups are based on the concept of killing ghosts. The game introduces no extra buttons compared to original Pac-Man, thus question arises if those powerups are fundamentally different from (still present here) power pellets, and the answer is, quite a few aren't; the biggest yet common difference is that ghosts don't go blue and calm, thus they can rush into you and die. Typically the reach of unlockable powerups is way better than power pellet's one, to be minimally balanced by static scoring, but there are some underpowered aversions. A few powerups don't involve killing ghosts, even less don't involve ghosts at all, some introduce actually interesting kill mechanics. Now, there isn't really much more to the game in the first place, but I think the game would be better if most of these powerups were cut and the rest were made slightly more sophisticated.  And then there are upgrades for powerups, which seem to be developed with a template: all involve exclusively increase of powerup duration and/or increase of points gained upon killing a ghost with one. There is one powerup in particular in case of which I'm pretty sure duration increase is more of a downgrade than anything. If you want something else to happen to your favorite powerup, you may find it interesting that latter half of unlocks is full of semi-clones of earlier ones, with some odd upside but usually no marked downside, and with actual usablity improvements varying. The best thing I can say about this is that you can load both into your set of three spawnable powerups, thus reducing randomness for your enjoyment of general arcade part of the game, and also for selected missions in which both powerups work.  After some time spent playing, I'm sad to report the game does not really develop compared to where it started. It's fun at the beggining, sure, but there are so much better games sold at comparable price it's not even funny."
455440,Spell Fighter VR,First negative experience in my VIVE. The movement is insane. The weapons are awkward at best. The spell system is the worst. Everything feels clunky and slow except for the movement which is too fast. Maybe they will work it out but they need to slow down the movement speed and speed up the other actions. Casting a spell needs to happen fast. You need a way to reload the guns. The swordplay needs to support fencing instead of rewarding sword flapping.

455830,FrightShow Fighter,"This game is all kinds of janked up.  It feels like a pre-alpha, but apparently it's not.  The movement is clunky and feels unresponsive. The controls are bananas in the bad way. The graphics are this weird, jarring blend of hand-drawn sketchy backgrounds with low res 3d characters. The animation is ridgid and doesn't time well (those jumps). The music is okay and fits the theme.   The overall idea and design has a decent amount of potential, but it's not realised at all.  If you took the original Clay Fighter and made it worse, you'd still have better game than this, with similar themes and ideas.  It was originally pitched for mobile and that is about the only excuse I can think of for the quality. Especially the controls."

4560,Company of Heroes - Legacy Edition,"The game itself is one of the best rts I have played.  The DRM and logging into to steam/THQ/more DRM kills the game.

Theres a torrent client built into the 1000 DRM layers that uploads patches to other players. Genius! I love my bandwidth being used to serve patches to everyone else.  I had to get a crack off a torrent site just to get this game to work in multiplayer, way to reward people who give you money THQ.  Take a wild guess on the ratio of THQ games Im going to play in the future to how many im gonna buy."
456130,Space Scaven,"Space Scaven is a pretty simple (Easy to learn, hard to master, in a way) puzzle game. It's got a good amount of levels   50   but does get repetitve rather quick. I would recommend picking it up when it's on sale, as $6 is a little on the pricey side unless you absolutely  love  puzzle games.  Plus, it runs on a toaster!"
456160,Flag N Frag,This game includes but is not limited to:     Fragging    Flagging     Note: not necessarily in that order.  
456430,Christmas Adventure: Candy Storm,"The game wouldn't work on my Windows 8 laptop in which all other hidden object games so far have worked, nor in the newer Windows 10 laptop. After updating the old one to Windows 8.1, decided to try again and this time it worked. The game is fairly short and mostly easy, although the hint button will become useful occasionally when the required actions don't make much sense. No real story, just an excuse to make you do all the stuff you need to do to get to the end. Still, it's a fun little diversion, if you can get it running. With that in mind, it's best to get it when it's discounted."
456440,The Orphan Dreams,"I haven't played the full story yet, but this game is nice as much as I played. Graphics are not that good but looking fine. I really liked the soundtracks. The story looks fluent. What I really appreciate about this game is that the whole game made by one developer-except some translations-. Good work Tayfun Tuna! Give us some more in the future. "
456450,Jaunt VR - Experience Cinematic Virtual Reality,Videos won't play for me. Lots of green and pieces of what could be a video. the controls pop up perfectly and even when you seek you see a thumbnail of what the video would look like at a given time.
456660,Slime & Friends,"So the game is obviously inexpensive. As an aspiring developer who wants to make games as a hobby, I was happy to have purchased this game. I can see the things that I would want to incorporate into my games and other things where I would take a little bit more time to enhance.  Regardless of my level of enjoyment of this game, you can tell that the developer spent a good deal of time on this. It seems the game was built using C++. I'm curious to what the result would have been if the developer used a pre-existing engine.  "
456690,Weather Lord: Following the Princess Collector's Edition,"May look simple and cheap at first glance, but don't let that fool you. The core gameplay is totally solid and fun; this game deserves way more attention than it seems to have gotten here on steam. Cleared all levels and achievements in 17 hours, and now I'm wishing there was more of it! So that's the only downside: replay value is a bit low, although it's still fun. You can work on improving your times, though your best time is sadly not tracked in-game. Also, getting a gold medal is usually a bit too easy, though some levels require you to plan carefully and try several times."
456780,DUCATI - 90th Anniversary,"More or less an expansion of the original Ride game, if you enjoyed the first game you'll enjoy this one too. You get 39 bikes, 10 or so of them also appear in the original Ride game, so veterans get around 29 truly new bikes. In terms of DLCs and Expansions for racing games, getting 29 new bikes for €20 is a very good deal.  The main reason to get this new game is for all the Ducati bikes, designed in detail and with unique sound and handling. The tracks are taken from the main Ride game, so nothing new on this front. The AI is really good and the game runs well on my PC.  They have tweaked the user interface to be more efficient to use than in the orginal Ride game. You have a Career mode that will take you dozens of hours to get through. It is a very challenging game, where you need to learn the tracks and adjust your bike's settings if you race on Medium and above.  My only complaint about the game is the same as with the Ride game; I wish the physics was more sim-like, closer to Milestone's MotoGP and SBK games. It would have added another dimension to the game.  If you are a fan of Ducati or a true fan of bike games in general, this is a fun game to play."

45720,Lost Planet: Extreme Condition - Colonies Edition,"Gotta say it took alot of time just to get the game running. Lucky there is a way to fix the start up in the discussions section. This game is great, old yet still very intersting. The story is stunning and mech combat is always fun. I found this game is pretty much a playable anime, imagine gundam but with aliens. So depending on how you think of that is how you should decide to buy this game."
457210,SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell,"  Satan steals beer from some metal fatso. So the fatso seeks the revenge and goes to the depths of Hell to take back his beloved beer (and bacon) from Satan. Sounds like a lame joke, so let's skip the introduction.  The gameplay is smooth, the player have to run as fast as possible to some blue portal. I actually enjoyed it for a while. But then it started to be very repetitive and the soundtrack (only one song?) started being boring.  Except the fast-paced aspect of the game, the player have to search every level for... I think you know for what... The damned cans of beer.  If i only had to run fast through locations might I had not care even at all about the graphics. But searching for the cans made me to look closer at the environment - which appeared to be absolutely terrible. Hell is an empty void with some random walls and traps all set in one place. No devils, no condemned souls. All the 'enviroment' is made mostly with big simple textured cuboids and the rest with other coarse shapes. Honestly, the only one thing made nicely is the player's hand.  I am happy I received this game for free, since it is overpriced as Hell on Steam. I might consider the game 'fine' if it cost like 5€, but 14,99€ is way too much for it."
457230,Atlas Reactor VR Character Viewer,"Well, the menu shows up and my controllers show up, but there's no way to select a character. There's no pointer or anything. All I can do is wave my arms around and flip my flashlight on and off. Not very fun."
45730,Dark Void Zero,"DRM issues are fixed. Game itself is a fun throwback to 8-bit games. Unless you are very good at these types of games, you'll want to play this on Easy mode (there are 3 difficulties) because it remains fairly difficult. There are only 3 levels apparrantly, but the game requires a hefty amount of skill to simply get past the first level. In fact, after 4 hours of trying I wasn't able to get past the first level's boss."

457450,Defend Your Crypt,"  The game is amazing, like, really. One of the developers I know is very nice too.  I suggest to buy it right now!"
457480,Domino Sky,On the plus side it runs well and the domino physics mostly work like you'd expect.  Unfortunately it's not much more than that. I didn't find the puzzles particularly challenging and it never really evolves past the simple concept.   Was hoping for more with this one.
457490,"Forgotten, Not Lost - A Kinetic Novel","I don't play a lot of visual novels, and especially not kinetic ones such as this. But I'm very glad I picked this one up and read through it. It's a tremendously moving story told well. It's also one with themes not normally touched on by games. I highly recommend it."
457520,Moustache Mountain,This game does'nt really have mutch to it but what do you exepect from a 2$ game?...  I look at this game as a wasted potencial. There could've been an awesome story to it that could add so much more to the game. With larger visual variety and like secret levels and collectables... THAT would add so mutch more value to the game!

457580,The Visitor,"I bought this because it was a dollar, and somehow it still wasn\'t worth it. You sit in a room, looking around, waiting for something to happen. That\'s it! And that\'s okay, because lots of VR experiences do that, but this one takes friggin\' ages. Seriously, could it be any slower? It was a bit scary at first but then I just got too bored to go on. It might have actually been stuck. Bug? I\'ll never know."
45760,Ultra Street Fighter IV,the game is ok but it doesn't support my steam controller and i hate to use a keyboard cuz it's dosen't feel right.if you are good with a keyboard in fighting games then this is the game for you but for me it's not but over all I recommend USFIV because it's a badass

457660,Andromedum,"I like BIG books, I can not lie. Here is the thing, I own quite an extensive library of books (500+) and an extensive library of Audible books (200+). All genres from the late 1600's to published just last month. I admire the art form of writing and the creativity that goes into it. This is an entirely new art form that is limitless in it's infancy. I stopped on page 26 of 500+ pages, just to write this review. It is a fantastic first step and I am excited to see where this goes. Bravo to the devs/authors bravery in building this. After 50 years of collecting stories, I have an entirely new format to pursue. What a great time to be alive."
457670,Vrideo,"  Does not let you watch VR videos from your hard drive like Milk VR for the Gear VR so you are limited to only watching what they offer to you. In fact, I have yet to find any program for playing VR videos from ones hard drive. If the Vive hopes for support in the world of VR videos they had better develop a method of viewing said videos. Also, the quality of all the videos I saw was pretty bad."

It is a rare view into the everyday struggles of blindkin and their adventures in hotels.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZYv5p-rx58   I enjoyed my time with this game! It was certainly a difficult challenge! Perhaps it could be a bit longer however.

457710,Road Madness,"Gibus christ, have mercy."
457770,Audio Arena,"Audio Arena is a bullet hell game set to music where you can use items to the beat to destroy the bullets.  What makes this game special, is it's extremely accurate. Unlike Audio Shield, the play on this syncs *exactly* to the beat. If you have musical training, you will especially appreciate this!  On the first day I already clocked three hours of play and made it up onto the leader board for several of the songs!  The songs are quite catchy instrumentals, with different tempos. Everything I listened to I enjoyed. There are a lot of songs, at least 15+. There is a progression system to unlock more songs, and different items.  This is now my favorite game for the HTC Vive.  Cons:  * The screen does redraw (goes grey) once in a while. * Without an ingame score it's hard to know what actions lead to the most points.  Besides those things, I overwhelmingly recormmend this game."
457810,Sky To Fly: Soulless Leviathan,it is so simple. i would like it if i was 7 years old and just started to play games.
457820,Outrage,"pretty okay game.  The difficulty never really ramps up enough, only a few of the last fights were even vaguely challenging.  There are a bunch of varrying different weapon types, but they don't actually mean that much in difference  Armor, Weapons, and characters all don't scale over the course of the game, which is a bit odd. Armor mostly doesn't scale, which means the only scaling in the game is in the accessory slot, and consumables  The story never quite followed for me. It was there, but it didn't feel like there was anything to it  The game didn't last terribly long, but with the lack of progression, that might be a good thing"
457860,Apollo 11 VR,Great experience. I would say a must if you have VR.

457980,Adele: Following the Signs,"  [Disclaimer: I won this game from an indie dev giveaway on twitter, so I paid no money for it]  I really wanted to like this game, seeing as it is a first attempt by a new indie company. Had it been made by one or two people, I’d say bravo, however a team of 13 came together to create this and well, I’d like to hear whether or not they all actually enjoy playing the game, because to my experience, it is not a fun game to play.  The premise is relatively intriguing, in spite of it being yet another zombie game. However the controls are not nearly responsive or precise enough for this type of platforming. Couple that with not enough checkpoints and inconsistencies with the game logic, it just leads to frustration and constant death/repeat cycles.  Example: in the first encounter with a zombie you are told to be quiet or they’ll hear you. That’s fine, it just means you have to walk past them instead of run. Cue: excruciating walking sections. Fair enough, that’s a rule I can put up with. Oh wait, several sections later and there is an identical zombie that will straight up instakill you as soon as you go near it, regardless of the speed you are going. *sigh*  The jumping is infuriating: from a standing start, you jump upwards three feet and about an inch forwards, so you may struggle to jump onto a box you are standing right beside. From a walking start, you jump upwards three feet, and six inches forwards, again you might still struggle to climb the box. From a running start you jump upwards about three feet, and forwards about fifteen feet. That seems like a reasonable progression. *facepalm*  Level two “This Rat Ain’t Chef” (I guess something got lost in translation there): there’s a section where there is a corpse in a box with a rat eating it. Above, some platforms suspended by rope. With no prompting, you are supposed to realise on your own that if you push this corpsebox into the right position, the rat will chew through the rope and lower the platforms. I guess my mind just couldn’t make that logic leap, I applaud those who did manage it. I found a Spanish Let’sPlay of the game on youtube that let me pass this section. (And on this note, why would give your game the name of a world famous singer who is known only by that single name? Good luck getting found easily on search engines). *golfclap*  Level four is a boss level, of sorts. You enter the level and run to the right for a solid 50 seconds or so, jumping twice and ducking once, until you encounter a large brute zombie, at which point you turn around and run to the left for 50 or so seconds, jumping twice and ducking once. Other than the initial roar, there is no indication that he is chasing you (sound? rumble? screenshake?), so if you run away at first, you might pause to make sure he is actually chasing you, at which point he will appear at full speed and batter you. So then you’ll have to wait for the scene to load and then run to the right for 50 seconds… jumping twice and ducking once… etc., etc.  The game looks alright, if you ignore the occasional blocky Unity tree, and the sound design is good-ish, but neither are good enough to redeem the terrible platforming, poor controls and occasional bug (I repeatedly got stuck in the climbing animation on a rope, which the only escape was to drop to your death), so unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend Adele: Following The Signs to anyone. I tried not to ♥♥♥♥ all over a new developer, but the more I wrote, the worse it got, so I’ll stop here. There are much better versions of this type of game out there, that are made much better and are more fun to play. Sorry. "
4580,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade","The campaign lasted half as long as the one in Soulstorm but it is to be expected. This game was released prior and was the one that introduced the Tau race into the Dawn of War series.  A great RTS game, just as good as Soulstorm without mods. At the time, it introduced more races than any other Dawn of War game which was and still is a great feature of the game. But with Soulstorm out, and with the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod out. I recommend getting Soulstorm first and if you do get really into the Dawn of War franchise, then get Dark Crusade as well.   I give this game a 8/10. You get a game with everything you need, different races and variety of maps just like Soulstorm. Each race is very different from each other. The same flaws from Soulstorm apply here as well as the replayability factor compared to Soulstorm. But thats small nitpicky stuff.  *Edit* Just like Soulstorm, The game would get a 10/10 if you had the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod as it adds a titan's worth of content into the game. The reason why this game's score got a lower rating than Soulstorm is because Soulstorm is basically this game but with more base content in it."
458000,March of the Living,"Though I love the idea of an FTL-style zombie survivial game, this game suffers from three main drawbacks.  First, the combat isn't fun. On top of being a generally boring design, multiple aspects of the combat make it difficult to get the survivors to do what you want them to do. For example, let's say you get in a fight with 4 basic zombies and 4 strong zombies (faster and more deadly, and thus should be prioritized). Your survivor will try to shoot them in the order they appear in the HUD, which is usually basic zombies first, followed by strong zombies. If you specifically command the survivor to shoot the first strong zombie (#5 in line) and he kills it, he will then default back to shooting the first basic zombie (#1), forcing you to pause and repick his target every single time. When you have 3 survivors and it is not clear who is targeting what, it becomes a madhouse where more than half the fight is spent paused ensuring they are shooting the things you actually want them to shoot.   Second, the zombie apocalype narrative is often poorly executed. Frequently, it is clear that the developers had a specifc functional result in mind for a scenario, but failed to attached a believable storyline/theme to it. For example, the developers wanted a situation where you have the option to fight an unspecified number of zombies to get a random reward. The scenario they come up with for this involves your survivors happening upon a building and having a guy tell you that he will give you a reward up front if you will go an kill a group of infected for him down the road. In reality, what idiot in a zombie apocalypse would agree to fight a bunch of infected without asking 'hey, what's this reward you are going to give me? I'm not gonna go fight a zombie hoard if all you are gonna give me is a pack of matches.' The game is absolutely rife with these kinds of situations, and it completely destroys your immersion with the narrative.   The final problem is an extension of the second, namely that the poor scenario writting leads you to incorrect assumptions about how they will turn out. For example, I got to the final location in the game and needed to get by some infected. Before this scenario, all of my survivors were fed and well rested. One of my survivors suggests she scout ahead, another suggests we get a car, and my last option is basically to bum rush the zombies. I have my survivor scout ahead, but she doesn't come back. I wait for five hours, but she doesnt return, so I give up on her. Now, you'd think that my survivors might have been able to rest or at least take shifts in the 5 hours of safety that I spent waiting, If not, you'd think I would now be given the option to take my other survivor's suggestin of finding car. At the very least, you'd think I'd have the chance to rest up and eat something before bum rushing the zombies, given the 5 hours I've already be able to wait with no danger. But no, I am forced to immediately charge the zombies with all of my remaining survivors exhausted and starving. I have not played March of the Living since.  All in all, its not a bad game and there is fun to be had, but you have to be willing to put up with some notable issues."
458030,StarFringe: Adversus, Early Access Review
458060,Drusilla Dreams,"Too rushed, and hard to follow. I played through to get two different endings, and I still can't recommend it. The price point is not the issue, but rather the content and its presentation.  First of all, the artwork is nice, and I don't have much to fault the music either. These are the things I would consider positives of the experience. The negatives follow.  There is very little character development with as short of a game as this ends up being, the flow of events is very disjointed, almost nonsensical at times. I recognize the goal was to look at a point of history and try to represent historical figures in these characters, but frankly there are some rather disturbing patterns being played out here by these representations, and there is very little rhyme or reason behind it in the context of the game.  There is a predisposition to violence and debauchery that the player is just supposed to accept without thinking much about it, and it feels quite jarring.  I think if more time had been spent in actually developing these characters' stories, even if fictional elements had to be incorporated to make it all flow better, and showing them going from a point of relative sanity and progressively declining to the point that they are represented currently in this game, it might have made for a better experience overall.  As-is though, I can't enjoy or even sympathize with any of these characters or their situations, and especially not their mannerisms and conduct, so I can't recommend the game in its current state."

458420,Last Heroes 3,This Game is pretty good. I definitely recommend this game if you played the last two.  Gameplay Video (Commentary):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5A1FvH5xDM   I myself have never played the last two. But still found the game enjoyable.  I personally still like games made from RPG Marker.
458450,GAIN,"I went in thinking 'This is exactly what I was looking for in a stealth game, even though I never did thought about that'. A Rogue-like stealth game, it just makes so much sense and it's great!... on paper.  The problem is, this game falls short. A great idea that is, in my opinion, just not polished enough.  You start with a throwing knife and a gun loaded with 5 bullets. The aiming and hit-scan is wonky, sometime I aim properly and miss my target where sometimes I just run and gun to get headshot after headshot. And the throwing knife... the problem with it is that it's a THROWING knife. I have a hard time thinking that a stealthy person on a mission would throw away its only knife and then be weaponless.  Also the guards will sometime see you from afar and yet, sometime you could be near enough to whisper insults in their ears and be unseen. Oh, and when they see you, they will shoot. Either you get the 1 shot-kill treatment or the '80's movie vilain' treatment; 6 shoots and still be alive.  The 2 powers that you have, see thru wall and slow time, are nice but the X-ray vision is hard to get used to. There is no cooldown on the screen to tell you when to use it again and it shows you a cone to display the enemy sighting range... or so I think? Sometime the cone go thru the wall and it gets confusing fast.  And this is just a pet peeve of mine but the menus and options are not easy to navigate. Pressing ESC to quit is not enabled, the screen resolution options makes the UI moves left or right if you transition it. I'm fetching far, I know, but everything adds up in the end.  Dev, you have an excellent premise for the game, just need a bit more polishing   I love it and will keep on playing but... the game is hard mostly because of problems here and there. I personally love a game that is hard by implementation and design (Dark Soul series) and not because of 'bad' design for lack of better term.   TL;DR: Great idea but bugs and rough edges makes it hard."
458470,Grim Legends 3: The Dark City,"Meh. The other Grim Legends were so brilliant. This one feels ... I don't know, unfinished. No technical problems, and not even any super strong complaints. I didn't care about the story, though, or the characters. There wasn't anything visually stunning, nothing awful either. My rabid completionist soul was meh about the extra collection achievements, whereas those in 1 and 2 were fun. This feels more like it should be the first game as they found their stride then a sequel. Not bad, but not good either. If you haven't already played all the Artifex Mundi games, there are many that are better."
458480,Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone,"The best part of the game are the graphics. Otherwise, the story is boring, the voices are bad, very few puzzles are interesting and the hidden object scenes were not so great either. Also, I found the extra chapter confusing and rarely knew what I was supposed to do next.   "

I finally tried this game a few weeks after downloading it (I downloaded several VR games for the SO and friends to play, this one they did not make it to) and after trying myself, I immediately had to check if I paid anything for it or not; I am glad I didn't.  I don't feel this offered anything that other 'free VR games' do and honestly, I felt as if I wasted 10 minutes of my time. It did not instil fear, the monoluge did not make me interested in any way; if this is based on a short film then should it not make me interested in seeing said film.  Overall, while yes it is free, I still don't find the time spent playing it worth playing it at all."

The graphics are classic carnival games style like on the wii make a fun feel and look . 12 great games to play and compete with friends and family . This is a must have on the htc vive if you love carnival type games."
458960,Winning Putt: Golf Online,"Let me first say that I am one of those players that falls under the category of not liking actual golf but loving golf video games. You could march 20 professional golfers in front of me and short of one being Tiger Woods I wouldn't be able to recognize any of them. But anyway, ever since the NES version of golf I have been in love with golf games and curiously enough 20 years later the swing meter follows the exact same concept.   Now that we got that out of the way let me start off by saying that the basics that make for a fun golf game and game play are present in this game. Whether or not you have some necessities to actually make your experience enjoyable is another question. You start off EXTREMELY hobbled. I was struggling to not get triple bogeys on every hole. The swing meter is VERY unforgiving and can get you very frustrated. As you go around and start playing rounds with random players you start to notice that other players do not seem to have as much trouble as you do. Then you notice they have certain clubs, buffs, accessories, enchantments. You start shopping around for these things and notice in order to get anything worthwhile you have to purchase them. Hey, no problem. I can do that. Then you notice there are two types of currency. Gold, which is in game currency you earn through matches and missions and the precious platinum which they give out to you in drips and drabs every once in a blue moon.   The platinum is what you purchase with actual real money. the going price is $10 for 5000 platinum. I know what you are thinking. You are thinking, 'Wow, I bet you can buy a lot of sh!t with that.' WRONG! For example, there is a buff used when you putt that gives you a projected path of the ball. Trust me, this is almost mandatory when you get on some of these greens that are crooked as fk. They sell them by the 100 for guess what? 5000 platinum! The prices on this game are out of control. But nevertheless there is still alot of crap you can buy with the inhouse gold. One way to make a lot of in house gold is by using the challenge option. This is where they match you up against certain PVE computer players of different ranks. Depending on the rank of the player you can get a certain amount of gold for defeating that player. The only problem is you are only only allowed play three challenges a day and if you lose all three of them then you are sh!t out of luck. Not only do you not make any gold but it cost you money to enter these contests. So guess what happens when you go and try to play after you have expended your three limit challenge? Yep, you guessed it. You can circumvent the three limit by paying platinum currency. This game just oozes greed. In my guesstimation you are probably looking at spending about $60 to really enjoy this game. Perhaps more down the line.   You may say well $60 is not bad. Most triple AAA games cost that much. This ain't no Triple AAA game bruh. The graphics are OK, I would say 7 outta 10. The optimization is absolutely TERRIBLE! It is common to drop to 14 FPS in town's square which ain't no big deal since that is not where the actual game play is. Its not acceptable but not a huge deal. But occaisonally you will get a drop like this in game play and that is fkn unacceptable. You are giving me 14 FPS with mediocre graphics set on medium and there ain't even 50 guys running around on screen like most MMOs? GTFO here! And you have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for petty buffs and clubs? I cannot recommend this game even though I really wanna love it since I love golf games and as I mentioned the game play could be fun with the right equipment AND no frame rate drop. The frame rate drop is what caused me to down vote it. You cannot have a jumpy screen when trying to peg that swing meter. Impossible. As previously mentioned, without buffs just pegging the meter slightly to the left or right means means rough, bunker or even worse hazard or OB.  I think if in a few months, they realize no one is playing any more and they decide to work on the graphics and for fks sake get that FPS to a minimum of 30 with a full server, then maybe it might be worth giving it a shot. I personally think they should A) fix the graphics, B) charge 15$ to actually buy the game and C) drop the P2W model entirely and go with p2p with charging for REALLY special packages but make most of the good clubs and buff accessible for reasonable in game currency. The game has potential to be really popular but as of now I cannot recommend.  EDIT: As of today (11/16/2016) the putt guide buff is selling for 2500 platinum. Maybe they are starting to realize they are asking too much for stuff.  EDIT2.0: As of today (11/26/2016) the game is STILL struggling with FPS drops to the point of making the game practically unplayable.  EDIT3.0: After playing the game for a solid month and a half and no longer experiencing FPS drops or swing bar skipping I have changed my vote from No to Yes. The rest of my comments about the outrageous prices still stands though. Game is fun and with the main technical issues resolved it is now worth giving it a shot."
458970,Intruder Alert: Ixian Operations,"Strategy, HUGE battles, 6 factions with TOTALLY different gameplay, great replayablity, simple mechanics, resource management, lots of options, team or solo, old school, sci-fi and lots of building, whats not to love? I have some suggestions for the devs: better music and ability to save games. Overall it is a good game."
459010,Ghost Town Mine Ride & Shootin' Gallery,"Unfortunately I got motion sick after 10 min. Nevertheless the game was spooky, I really liked it until that point and wish I could play it again without getting sick.   I did not ask my money back for this game, I still think it is good to have and I will show it to my friends and family members.  "
459020,Melting Hearts: Our Love Will Grow 2,"One of the best games ive played in a long time, simple and easy to figure out and I trust the developer to get back to us quickly when there is a problem. Thank you for a great game."
459040,Medieval Battlefields Black Edition,The description of the game is misleading.  The 'campaign' is a series of standalone scenes. The game is more of a puzzle than turn-based strategy. Nothing in the game is persistent from map to map.
459090,Masquerada: Songs and Shadows,"I liked this game, it was beautiful with an interesting world and characters, but the main reason i bought it was the diverse cast. But then i was disappointed to find out the creators had to put homophobia in a fictional fantasy world...again...as if there are not enough oppressions...' sigh' I'm not sure i can bring myself to finish and enjoy it."
459130,Love in the Glen,"Huh. I didn't realize that this game started out with the protagonist   already married to one of the love interests.   That cut down on my options a bit - basically to just the one route, which lasted about five minutes. I'm a little bummed that I paid full price and didn't get much story, but what I  did  experience was very enjoyable!"
459160,Allods Online,I love this game. On one side it's a fantasy game if you play from the League perspective. If you play ffrom the Empire perspective it's a steampunk game. I find both sides fun but am now into the Empire side. This is what it is. I feel I can honestly recomend it. Advice though make friends with experienced players becuase there is a lot to absorb and you will need help.
459170,Discovr™ Egypt: King Tut's Tomb,"You have to admire them for the try, and it's a free experience so what can I say...  but keep in mind a few things:  1) It's not accurate. The wall murals 'wrap' because they didn't have the right scale. If you didn't know that, you would wonder why the Egyptians did this - which they did not. 2) Low resolution - the murals are SO important - yet are barely legible.  3) Nothing is in it's right place - and so much from the tomb wasn't included. 4) The actual doors between rooms are wrong.   Again, I appreciate the effort, but this comes across as a 'historical' representation and it is not. You could rename it 'Discovr Egypt: King Tut's Tomb reimagined'.  Guys, you should add a disclaimer at the start saying 'This in no way represents an accurate portrayal of King Tut's real tomb.'"
459260,Bowslinger,Its a shame that Bowslinger does not provide more variation.  What it does do is get the fundamentals right; the bow mechanics are good. Threre's something about hearing the early stages of The William Tell Overture played too...  It's not that it is a bad game but there are other archery games on VR which provide more of a dynamic challenge.  For now its a thumbs down.
459310,The Hero Project: Redemption Season,"After Heroes Rise 1, 2 and 3, this one feels completely meh. The story is there, but istead of doing hero work (See that 'Hero' in the name of the game) it's just politics, politics and more politics. The story is not even finished, ending with a cliffhanger.  Dear author, you placed too much emphasis on the RealityShowYAAAAY side of the game and kinda forgot everything else. Can somebody please nuke the Hero Project so we can go back to doing meaningful stuff? Preferrably disconnected from media-whoring? Thank you."
459470,Wars of Napoleon,"This game just does not work. I can't complete a turn without a crash, and because I left the menu running for a couple of days while I went away for work Steam won't refund. Don't take the risk. Do not purchase."
459520,Kinacoustic,"This game is very neat, but I quickly lost interest due to how difficult it was to make something worthwhile because of the bounces that could potentially mess up your creation.  If you're very patient and looking to relax, this is the game for you."
459540,Cherry Tree High Girls' Fight,"Plain RPG mechanics would have just fine. The girls are manly delinquents with some that are likable. Run, for your RPG loving life as there is some 'role playing' but it's the simple, I like or disprove of you and not really your fault  shortcomings now get back to training. Lets say a game with random and/or bland girls and simple rpg mechanics (and MORE time between combat) Is worth more than this hack of poker 'game'. Like Monster Rancher. "
459550,Catch Canvas,"At the time of writing this i just finished the game, all endings (but ill touch on that), so as you can see it is a rather short VN. Gameplay is as to be expected from a VN although i found the rewind function makes all choices raher pointless and i found the CGs beautifully drawn, as for the story it is rather simple and straight forward with small attempts at drama in parts, the characters fall into their own archetype (shy girl, the ditzy cute girl, and a tsun-tsun). ***THE ENDING*** this wont spoil anything although just saying because of the ending all previous choices made mean nothing its very anti-climatic too.   Now if your like me and you downloaded the 18+ patch (recommended) the H-scenes are nothing too speical and the sexual content is rather minimal  Over all Catch Canvas is a fun, cute, little (very little) VN. The characters are fun although are very 2d and dont go beyond their original motivations much (art), the story is interesting albiet short, and the eroge aspect is lackluster i do recomment this game for a quick pass time, for sure worth a play but dont expect to be blown away."
459580,LightWalk,Too much Light Too much Walking  Game blows  10/10
459630,R.C. Bot Inc.,"Perfect example of how not to make a game. Controls is a disaster and the ui is the worst I have seen in any game. Graphics (not the UI) is okay, but it isn't helping this game. Developers seems to have abandoned the discussions/forums.  I really can't understand why this is on Steam at all. Or that this isn't even EA.  Gameplay and controls 1/10 Graphics 5/10  Don't buy this, as you most likely will regret it."
459680,Auro: A Monster-Bumping Adventure,"Quite interesting mechanics, but don't let hexes fool you, it's closer to puzzle than tactics. And the game's structure is very simple, there's no metagame whatsover. Lack of high resolution is a deal breaker, otherwise I'd play it. The price shouldn't be higher than $1."

459940,Deer Man,"idk why everyone hates this game, the story is great even if its only 30 minutes long and the soundtrack provides an eerie ambiance like no other. it's great, 10/10 would play again/recommend"
46000,Bob Came in Pieces,"Did not make it far into this game before succumbing to my boredom. It's frustrating to maneuver your saucer as this game does not handle momentum well, and the puzzles are very straightforward and pretty much always requires you to run back and forth between build stations to slightly adjust your ship for very specific tasks. The game trailer may seem promising, but I have received no enjoyment from this game, and will promptly hide it in my game library."
460120,Megadimension Neptunia VII,"probably the best nep games i ever played 10/10. the game system is more balance than previous nep games. except for the dlc, they're toooooo overpowered(sorry if bad english). waiting for goddesses online release on steam........................ still waiting"
460150,One Last Chance,"Overall it is a very nice piece of life story. It`s easy to relate with the characters and the music and character drawings are pretty good. About the voices, there are not bad but could have bin a bit more emotionally.  The only bad/sad thing is that the novel is very short only 30-60min. And some of the choices seams like having not much meaning behind it.  If a view bugs are ok for you for such a short story I can recommend it for you, if not maybe wait until some offers. "
460160,The Leisure of Grisaia,Few minutes into the game and you see a couple of lesbian in heat in a cramped locker. GG.  I could give this a 10/10 but I give this an 8/10 because the best girl only appeared at the few minutes before the end. Worth the 40 minutes and the $2 tho.
460190,Rocket Riot,Got this in the Jingle Jam bundle and it's a fun little game to play for a couple hours.
460220,Xenoraid," Thank you to the developement team for generously supplying me with a review key.  ---  I fell deeply in love with  Neon Chrome  and to a lesser extent,  Crimsonland . Just some really polished, addicting titles. The devs knew  exactly  what makes a great game.   Xenoraid , isn't bad at all... It's just... Not great.  It saddens me a bit to say that, because I had high hopes.   Essentially, this is a schmup with a lite upgrade system.  You progress through levels and collect money to buy upgrades or new ships. The cool novelty here is that you swap between ships mid-action. This essentially means/feels like you are swapping weapons. Thats the only difference; flight speed and ship size are essentialy the same as far as it felt to me. This novelty is really cool, though. It works really well with controller support - each of the four ships is mapped to the controller face buttons.   The upgrade system is pretty 'meh', to be honest. There aren't that many upgrades available, and what is there is ho-hum. Stuff like 'upgrade your shield' and 'upgrade your bombs' is fine, but it is very standard. I would have liked to see more upgrades like stuff in  Neon Chrome . Really blow the field wide open and make stuff get crazy.  It's not really one particular thing that makes this title kind of bland. The story is oh-so-forgettable. I mean, honestly, they should have just left it out. The enemy variaty is very low. Questionably low, in fact. What would it have take, from a developement standpoint, to add in more upgrade options?   Local co-op was fun, though. I really enjoyed that part. Unfortunately, I think most time spent overall for people will be in the single player campaign or survival mode.   Pros:  +High level of polish, which was expected from this developer +Controller support is great +Local co-op was fun +Cool novelty of swapping out ships   Cons:  -Too few upgrade options, and what is there is not that impressive -Enemy variaty is really low -Ships debatably all feel the same except for the main gun; couldn't they have different sizes/speeds/etc.?   Get it on sale.  Nothing is terrible about this title, but considering the asking price, I don't think people will be racking up tons of hours."
460230,Starters Orders 6,just got game..used to love the game..was very excited to see it on steam.now i got this big advertisement for there app that shows every now and then and all my menus stack (when i open somthing up it just stays and the new stuff opens over top of it and eventually my mouse is like a big crayon and you can move it back and fourth on the screen and it fills it in..i thought originally it was me pc but tried to duplicate with other programs and it is only this one..game seems to be real fragile..
460340,Guards,"A very beautiful strategy game. The action takes place in a magical world filled with magical creatures. The music in the game is also gorgeous, she looks like melody from movie fantasy. Loved that the battles take place step by step. Monsters and characters are drawn very high quality and resemble the game Warcraft. Enjoyed a very nice interface, there are a lot of different settings and equipment. I don't expect you will long to play it, but a couple of evenings to spend on the study. I think the point is to buy and try."
460580,Star Chart,Very disappointing - if i knew how to get my money back I would  Frankly this product is a long way from fulling the requirements of a VR planetarium   The Solar system demo provided free in 'The Lab' demo is graphically superior and more fun  Do not waste your money on this in its current form
460630,Trouble Witches Origin - Episode1 Daughters of Amalgam -,"  this game is good , it's so good , but remember don't ever u change screen setting to full screen or u will be like me , can't even login to the game cuz bug"
460640,Breached,Nice idea and story is intriguing. Unfortunately game play involves randomly hunting around for resources in a difficult to control drone. I dislike searching games so I've stopped playing.
460650,Tick Tock Bang Bang,at first i was bored playing through the game and felt it become a chore but as the game progressed i found myself actually enjoying it. the game while i thought was just a superhot ripoff it still had its perks which set it apart.   where the game is at the moment its not worth your money.   its too short i beat the levels the game had to offer in 2 hours and after that the only thing left to do is either play user created levels which arent many or create your own level which can be fun for more of the creative type of people.   its a fun game overall but i feel you should wait for a price drop.
460700,Song of the Deep,They shouldn't. The steam controler doesn't work and it doesn't work with the xbox controllers either. I am very unhappy about this and am letting everyone know. PS. I work at a game store.
460780,Avadon 3: The Warborn,"I don't write too many reviews, but I felt this game warranted one. Bottom line, this game is excellent and definitely worth picking up. Story is solid but not overbearing, and the decisions you make feel as through they really matter. This makes for enjoyable and engrossing gameplay. The itemization is on point so far (about 15 hours in atm) where there are periodic upgrades but not so often that you feel like you're swimming in loot. Overall very entertaining and a solid way to spend some time, for relatively little cash."
460850,Allumette,"Everything is great except that the animation of the characters is very sluggish. Not sure if this is a techincal problem or the intended art style. It makes the viewer uncomfortable, feeling as if playing a game with serious framerate issue (while in fact this game has no framerate problem)."
460910,A-Gents,DONT BUY THIS GAME!  For the game itself... well it's like the million another copys from the good old games and you realy shouldn't waste money for a unity trash remake! donwload a emulator for on of the classics and dint waste your time on this!  comes with all unity features: - flickering screen - not working gamepad controll - needs alot off resource without any reason..
460920,Steep,"I thoroughly enjoy playing a much more phsically fit avatar dude hiking up high mountains and jumping to his death, repeatedly. Worth it for the terrifying sceams right before he crashes....would be 10/10 but the game needs more wolves, bears and yetis to spice up the hiking bits. This could have been a serious 'survival on the mountain' game but as it stands, it's a fun game for doing all that stuff I am allergic to in real life (due to a sense of my of frail mortality and a love of creature comforts).  Should you get it? Look, I ended up getting the season pass so whadda I know."

460960,The Deed: Dynasty,"I've played The Deed so I decided to play this one too. It's basically the same as The Deed. Interesting storylines, it's longer, because there are three characters, but it's harder than The Deed. I'm having a difficult time framing any one else for the murders. :( "
460970,Soulcaster: Part I & II,Those two little gems are in my opinion a perfect example of how to make a wonderful game based on a simple but interesting gameplay idea.  I enjoyed both of them years ago and I'm so happy they now are on Steam as well.  Recommended for all strategy and tower defense games lovers.
460990,The Impossible Travel Agency,"Not a bad experience as such but it just does not run very smoothly on my i7 4790k with 32GBs of RAM, Geforce GTX 1070 with 8GBs of RAM under windows 8.1 using my HTC Vive.  As such if they can get it running better I would give it a positive review but at the moment I cant really use it as a demo for friends so I will need to request a refund.   But I do like the idea and art work so if they can optimize it to run better and add in a little more interaction I would happily change my review."
461010,Roll'd,"The game starts up in full screen on the wrong monitor and the left arrow key is permanently on making it totally unplayable. It's no big deal as I got it on special for 49c but anyone with a razor keyboard be aware it won't work.  Today I grabbed an Xbox 360 wireless control. Although it works with this game, the stuttering issue with the left arrow key is still present and the game is still unplayable."

I don't know how many hours I put into it when it orginally came out - at least 10 to 12 - but I'm looking forward to playing through it again with some enhancements. Not only are the puzzles a fun challenge as the mechanics become more intricate later on, but the whole atmosphere of the game is very engaging. I get a big smile on my face playing this."
461490,Kaboom Monsters, Early Access Review
461500,Omega Agent,"I love this game on the Gear VR and collected every briefcase and blueprint and beat every level. On that version, it gives you a swivel chair turning option, which, for example, lets you turn to the right while looking to the left. This version does not give you that option. It only lets you turn with the right analog or turn by looking. Neither are acceptable to me, so I don't recommend this. Maybe, they left it out because they didn't think people with cords would want that option, but I would with my HTC Vive, as I can stand and turn all day long."
461520,Grizzly Valley,Needs to be worked on. I wish I could give more constructive criticism.
461560,Mandagon,"good art. but needs to have some challenge in it. there's just no catch. it seems more like an experimental game, the ones we can find at gamejolt. just experiences. i wasnt expecting this here."
461580,Galaxy Cannon Rider,great little game !!
461600,Zipple World 2: The Sweet Chaos,"That akward moment when I have just passed more levels randomly clicking on my mouse and keyboard, than trying to get this game serious."
461620,Predynastic Egypt,"My first 30 minutes or so I enjoyed the game - I thought it was relaxing and fun. That changed.  My scores on my games were: 0/35, -1/35, -1/35, 0/35, -0/35 - I only completed all the way to the end twice. THAT's on EASY? setting. You gotta be f ing kidding me? So I played 6 hours. I tried the easiest setting supposedly. The fastest game was FIVE turns where mysteriously my two guys just disappeared?! The first guy or the second guy ALWAYS seems to disappear on turn 4 for some reason? EVERY time. Your guy disappears on turn 4. (WTF?)  The game crushes you on 'easy' setting, I have no idea what it does on harder settings ( that makes it not fun for me, makes me give the game a bad review, tell my friends not to buy it, and post negative in the forums).   I found it to be unrealistic to 'win' the different levels / challenges. I tried expanding fast, didn't work. I tried expanding slow to build up resources, didn't work as the game just cascades down on you that you are behind to build a temple or whatever because you have been trying to gather resources – or else the game just attacks you with superior numbers.  I have like 400 guys and get crushed by an army of over 1000 because I haven't even discovered the other tribes I need. When I do find the tribes to bolster my army, I don't have enough little hammer production to give them gifts and 'Unite' in time. One time I actually DID have more soldiers than the attacking army (barely), but they won because they 'flanked' me? Where do I learn flanking, or anti-flanking, or anything I need? Nowhere, game over, city defeated.  The game tells you that I have so many turns to build something and I haven't even explored the North of the city I need to progress the discoveries I need. There's an automatic blockade, and so I have to stop everything to research and research to get the workaround.   BOTH times I got to the '15 turns to end of game' warning I was NOWHERE near uncovering the fog of war map, let alone converting the tribes I need! So in 15 turns I have to uncover the rest of the map, and fight or convert like 7 cities? Really? I think the BEST I got was ONE city on the big map converted before getting the 15 turn warning.  The biggest army I amassed by end game was 1.1K, meanwhile Seth had one city with 7K, a couple with 3K, and more... really? This is EASY? This is FUN?  Honestly, did you have ANYone test this thing out that is a casual gamer that doesn't know the code? ... or was I it? Did I have to buy the f ing game to test it for you and give you game play feedback? Hey, it's not expensive, so thumbs up there, BUT if all it does is end up pizzing me off, then it doesn't matter, does it?"
461640,Sins Of The Demon RPG,"The game feels very unpolished with many bugs from pathing issues to what is very likely mistakes due to lazy copy and paste. In addition, it has an issue where misses are usually what kill you. You could be overleveled and still die due to misses. As such, one fight is almost pure RNG if you weren't ready for the fight as there is a save point and if you use the save point, you can't go back to shop, turning the fight into an RNG test of frustration. There are even battles that are clearly unbeatable normally due purely out of the fact that your character has skills that cannot be used.  What bothered me most was that most of my deaths felt cheap where I lost to RNG or to fights that were after a long expedition with no save point until after the fight in question.  There is a lot of running back and forth pointlessly, causing the player to revisit the same areas over and over again. There are also the oh so fun consideration of content that makes little sense, including characters being able to pass over impassible objects and objects being re-initialized during cutscenes, often turning the objects into completely different items such as a path turning into a fence as a result of using the wrong map for a cutscene.  And with objects, it is rather confusing when you have the same resources for both active event objects that can be picked up AND for inactive event objects that can't be interacted with.  If that wasn't enough, a lot of the skits don't pop up right away as they appear to be timed. This means you could enter a cutscene and the skit won't appear until the cutscene is already in progress, making skits missable due to appearing during a cutscene or scene transition.  Another worrying thing is that the credits suggest that they do not know if they actually have the proper rights for certain resources in the game. For a commercial game, they should know exactly whether or not they have the rights to use the resources in the game."
461650,It's Killing Time,"For a 'Choice of' strory, the game is kinda underwhelming. It's more of a combination game (find what works best for which achievement) than a truly role-playing game.  And it's short.  Basically, it is well made, but I so not recommend it. There are better games from the same publisher out there."
461680,FPV Air Tracks,"Won't start up any track at all, keeps on crashing at every track i try..!"
461700,Seduce Me 2: The Demon War,"A story worth the praise of the universe, for sure. I don't often write game reviews, but credit where credit is due: the attention to detail in this game is massive. Eschewing the grinding that you run into in many Otome, both Seduce Me and Seduce Me 2 emphasize pure story. It's not an incredibly lengthy game (especially if you turn off sound and read like the wind), but so rewarding - each path is worth playing for the diversity of the primary plot, and there are diverse subplots with support characters also to be enjoyed.   What you can expect: a visual novel with a number of turns and twists with better replay value through additional, very different storylines than I have ever encountered in the genre. Voice acting is quite compelling (I listened through a couple of storylines) and the soundtrack contributes substantially to the mood.   If you haven't played the first game, you should, exploring at least each of the demon paths. Knowing the backstory will contribute a lot to your understanding the scenarios presented here.  Adult content caution: Seduce Me 2 has a lot more sexuality than Seduce Me, but the jump is from PG or maybe PG-13 (in film levels) to a soft R. The real leap in terms of challenging content is implied violence. Parts of this story are very dark. But that's some of what made this game so compelling."
461710,Tales Across Time,"It's not really an RPG - there's no leveling up, no character building, no extensive fantasy story...it's just a short visual novel in the disguise of an 8-bit RPG (and I dislike visual novels). If you enjoy those types of interactive stories, then you may like this, but since it's not really a JRPG, it just comes off as boring."
461750,Ghoul Kid,Video review and playthrough:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmWGsRI-iAg 
461760,Reptilian Rebellion,"What little I played is enough for a life time. It's more a cell-phone when you're in a desperately boring situation type game more than anything. You can't move forward or back, lizards come from left and right and you pick up ammo when you're out. It's basically a space-invaders clone. The graphics and the way the camera moves in a wave-like fashion literally makes me physically ill, it was 49c though so I mean try it but don't expect anything from it. Unless you're me and get motion sickness, agh my head is killing me as I write this."
461780,Moonstone Tavern,"  To be honest, I would love to give this game a good review, it’s a great idea, and the developers have put in a lot of work. But the reason I cannot recommended this game is that currently it has some major issues with frame rate, and optimization, currently (5/17/2016), it is a good game idea, and if you want to support more, hopefully better games from the dev, then buy the game, and maybe try it out, but as is, I wouldn't call it really playable from my experience.  For reference, I have 8 GB of ram, and an Intel i5 -3570k CPU  Update: The lag has been fixed, this is a great game from what I could tell when I first got it, go try it out! (11/4/16) There's a lot of content in terms of classes, familiers, and followers as well as a lot to repair as part of the tavern. I could see this game being a lot of fun and like a cross between rpg and tycoon style games."
461820,Legionwood: Tale of the Two Swords,"I enjoyed this game a lot. It has good music, nice map setup, good storyline, decent battle and quest systems. Of course, it has a few glitches and inconveniences here and there, but overall it's a good game. It's RPG Maker so graphics is pretty generic and pixelated. If you expect mesmerizing art styles, this genre is not for you.  The game is in the range of rather hard, but not too unmanagable and there are a few points that could be exploited to make boss battles a breeze, even for the Rift Entity and final bosses. However, as with many of this genre, it also requires a decent amount of time in grinding, but there's Exp boost items to accelerate the process. By the end of the game, my chars are about level 70-80+. Game is about 20 hrs, I spent more time because sometimes I left it in idle and I was stuck in a quest.  Even though I like the game, I must point out some points I don't like. The supposedly unbeatable boss (as he is immortal) is too easy, it should be made that it 2-3 hit KO party rather than let me drain its hp to 0 in 5-10 mins. The Sword of Lore, which is the weapon against final boss, is weak, and the supposedly ultimate weapon when I beat the optional Rift boss has the same stats, just adds a Deathstrike (nice against normal mobs, not working for boss). I can dual wield weapons and do much more damage than them (as they are 2-handed), especially with 2 crits at the same time.  The ending after the final boss is a little abrupt. Even the creator asked that, how in the world does the little sister know how to end the final boss and able to wield the sword specifically tailored to Gaia's reincarnation? The given explanation wasn't really satisfying. But well, it's just my feelings.  Overall, this is a good simple retro rpg game to play if you like this genre. If you don't, why would you even be here? :P"
461830,Adventure Apes and the Mayan Mystery,"The game itself seems fine, but it changes the screen resolution to 320 x 240 and puts the game in window mode, and makes it somewhat awkward to play. Also quickly quitting the game seems slightly less intuitive than it should be. But the game itself does seem fun."
461840,Zenge,"A beautiful and chilled out puzzle game, with a very zen feel to it.  Sliding pieces of a puzzle together to tell a short story, accompanied by a very relaxing soundtrack. Short but sweet."
461850,Abrix the robot,"When the 'Made in Unity' box pops up on game launch, you know these days the game is going to be amateurish bundle junk, and Abrix the Robot is just that."
461860,Tower Dwellers,"gameplay is clunky, the difficulty goes from stupid easy to impossible in one level. the rpg system makes literally no sense."
461880,Hyposphere,Great.
461890,NORTH,"WTF is this...? O.o I started the game and had NO idea what to do. Not one key did work (beside of WASD), sometimes an envelope pops up in the lower left corner but no way to read WHAT the character wrote or whatever. I walked into the 'Mines' and ran around in a maze with poison gas, after a while i found some kind of station to activate. But NO idea how many there are or what they do. AFTER i got out of there i walked to some yellow glowing stripes on a wall and THERE i could read the instructions for the mines. O.o Found a church, a blank white nothing with little black people in the background. But this Room bodyslams my framerate into the ground, although there is nothing there. So i walked out of this white void, down some stairs, clipped through the floor and fell out of the level. That would not be that tragic, IF there would be some kind of MENU to start a new game OR EXIT IT. You have to hit ALT+F4 to exit the game."
461940,PlanCon: Space Conflict,"Great game! It's almost retro, but actually is up-to-date enough."
461970,Skyreach,-bad control -it's not racing -buildup lag as u continue playing...
46200,A.I.M. Racing,Pod racing without any annoying kids! The awkwardly named A.I.M. racing is a wipeout style racing game where you pilot a hovercraft around a series of race tracks. There are power ups and game modes.  cons -rough round the edges -unbalanced -controls are odd -feels mostly slow -tracks not well designed or interesting  pros -feels kind of fast sometimes  Not recomended unless you need tp play a poor wipeout knock off 2 /5
462000,Cyberpong,"Since apparently I'm just buying anything that comes out for VR now like a lot of other people, I bought this after seeing it pop up in the store. Holoball had released earlier, and I really like that game. HB is closer to actual Pong in VR, while Cyberpong VR is basically a VR breakout.  I'll be blunt; I found the game boring after about ten minutes. I jumped right in and had no idea what I was doing; everything was moving really slow and it was actually a bit frustrating. I jumped back out and played through the tutorial and learned about the different weapon types and energy and all that jazz. Basically you can make your paddle bigger and shoot some boxes with different ammunition; nothing revolutionary, just a new take on 3D breakout in VR.  The problem with this though, is even when I had 4+ balls in play, the game was just boring. The balls come at you slow, the 'hallway' in where the blocks are is very narrow and limited (I have a large room) which makes the balls bounce odd ways; this makes for awkward hits on the ball in awkward positions that are more frustrating then fun. They also come very slowly; I assume as the game speeds on they get quicker as they did in multiplayer, but I didn't even want to play that long to find out quite honestly.  Which brings me to my next point, multiplayer. I played two games against he same opponent, and he was definitely already experienced in the game. That wasn't the problem though; because the space we were in/hallway we were hitting back and forth in was so small, he could reach pretty close to my field by walking ahead. This allowed him to put his hands right in front of the ball spawn and block the ball, hitting it quickly back towards him then towards me not allowing me to get the first swing or be ready for the hit. Not to mention the connection was laggy, so I assume it is client hosted which presented other problems in that my hits did not feel 1:1 with the ball and watching the opponent hit it was slightly off too. Another thing - when you walk outside of the specific area it wants you to stand in, the screen just goes black. That's disorienting and feels very lazy to me.  The game looks good graphically, and unfortunately that is all I can see being really positive about it. I guess I was spoiled by Holoball, which is fast paced and uses all of my room and is an actual take on Pong in VR, but Cyberpong VR did not live up to what I thought it might be from the name and multiplayer features that I saw when it first caught me eye."
462070,IWO: Bloodbath in the Bonins,"Played on MAC. I haven't seen any problems to play. I have also boardgame version but I prefer digital one to avoid to calculate enemy actions. It's hard to win, I've only draw in my best game yet."
462100,Starr Mazer: DSP, Early Access Review
462130,Momentum,"This game makes me rage more than anything on this earth, especially when I fall off so close to the end -_- but it's very addicting and very fun to play, I love it :) DEFINITELY worth your money"

46250,NecroVisioN: Lost Company,"I thought this one might not crash, but it does :-("
462520,Super Kaiju,"An excellent game that is very fun to play with friends, it also has an awesome unlockable system that doesn't feel force and keeps the game enjoyable!  Must buy if you love rts with some aiming skill involved!"
46260,Star Wolves 3: Civil War,I don't recommend this game
462680,BalanCity,Really not worth playing. 0/5 Rating
46270,Star Wolves,At the price point is a great game (espically when 75% off)
462730,Townopolis,"I started playing this game on my old laptop and it was surprisingly fun! I started the campaign mode which contains 40 levels. The game principle is not to complex, but not too easy. Most of the levels are possible with the first try, but some are a bit harder, especially to get a trophy. All in all a fun simulation.  Pro: - Easy to understand - Low system requirements needed - Quick rounds  Con: - Annoying music after a while - Badly designed faces  For the price (look at ♥♥♥ etc.), I give this game 6.5/10 "
462780,Darksiders Warmastered Edition,"boring, unskippable cutscenes. If I want to watch a movie, I'll go to the theater, thanks. ♥♥♥ off with this BS. A game is to play not watch."
46280,Star Wolves 2,"Complete crap, don't buy it if you liked the first game, because you'll get very disappointed. The music is decent, voice acting terrible (in the first game, the voice actors didn't speak English too well, but it was a lot better, and had more actors). The game's incredibly easy, it lets you get insane amounts of money from the equipment dropped by the enemies (which are also easy). It's insanely linear - fly to this sector, pretend that you don't expect a trap, kill everyone, fly to a different sector, repeat. Buy the first one (it was good), but forget that such a disgrace as is Star Wolves 2 exists."
462830,Airline Director 2 - Tycoon Game,"Its sad Steam sells this type of crap. Its a good idea, even a good interface but its about half done and crashes. Steam should not let these type of games come to market, they are blatently selling you a fraud."
462860,Crawlers and Brawlers,"Bought it, installed it, game wouldn't progress past the loading screen, got my refund.  If it gets fixed I'll try it again. Looks like fun."
46290,Theatre of War,really fun game. ai are a but pianful sometimes but apart form that good game
462910,Poly Runner VR,"This is great fun! Try competing with other people for who can get the best score. It actually becomes fairly challenging after a while. I like that there are different movement options. I play with the one where you tilt your head left and right to steer. In my opinion, it's the best. Anyway, this is a great game to have in your repertoire. You'll play it every once in a while."
462930,AdVenture Communist, Early Access Review
462950,The East New World,"Difficult, but not frustrating. Lovely little platformer. My only complaint if the lack of remapping controlls, and how ever with the controller, you still need a mouse and keyboard to navagate the menus (upgrading weapons, or buying accessories, for example)"
462960,Caveman World: Mountains of Unga Boonga,This is quite fun! Only played a little bit of it but its a fun little platformer to kill time. It reminds me a little of classic crash bandicoot.
462990,Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ English Edition,"(Do not mind the number of hours played, I read the unofficial English translation a year ago.)  Awesome Visual Novel, stays my favourite after having read classics like Clannad or Katawa Shoujo. I do not know on which edition this localization is based, but I expect an ending that will me me cry just like last year. I should not worry about it, though, since many works from Key are masterpieces – including Tomoyo After."

463010,One Way Flight,"Normally I love games like these, but this particular one is just....no.  Bland, slow, items are difficult to spot. I find myself randomly clicking instead of actually searching.   A shame because the concept itself is very interesting."
463030,Bottle,"There's things I like about Bottle, it's certainly pretty, it looks suitably cold, and the music is nice enough, but as a game, or an experience, it's lacking  Firstly the premise is fine in and of itself, but you don't feel it reflected in the game. You don't feel like an alcoholic who's wasted his life, not in the game at least.   The biggest problem is the layout of the game. You're given a vague note, and surounded by a vast thundra. It takes so long to get to one of the few key events you start to wonder if you're supposed to leave the path and go off into the sparse wilderness. It's not helped that some of the notes you find seem to actively point you in the direction of places you're not supposed to go, you're told to follow where the stag is facing, but the stag is looking at an invisible wall  The pace you move at only exasperates this problem, with long drawn out spells of nothing. Something that the developer was clearly aware of as there's orbs that dramatically increase your speed.  Bottle as it stands isn't a great game, but there's enough there that it can be learnt from. I could see the developers next game being a real improvement"
463070,Mecha Ritz: Steel Rondo,"Wonderful little shump that is exactly microtargetted at the exact spot where it has neat new ideas that are never hard to grasp or obtuse, and borrows just enough of what we know works to feel like it's pilfering the good stuff without being stale or derivative. Fantastic music and aesthetic to go with it too. "
463100,Liveza: Death of the Earth,"Sometimes you get worked up to rip a game to shreds but then you realize you're gonna hurt somebody's feelings. Then again it is somebody who thought the world could handle a 2D Commodore 64 style spiritual demake of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. heavily influenced by Amagon and other b-reel NES platformers, so..."
463110,Farnham Fables,Each day we stray further and further from the lords light.    what the ♥♥♥♥.
463150,BARRIER X,"A Very Very VERY hard game, it's incredibly fast and there's a noticable learning curve to actually perform well in each level. Got the game for 59 cents and I believe its worth the normal $3 price for the levels, the depth towards beating each level (60 seconds), and for trying to beat high scores if you feel the need to. I also enjoyed the messages after/before each level, they were short, sweet, and they motivated me keep at it regardless of how many times I failed. The game also runs very well (at least for me it did). It took me 2.2 hours to get 30 seconds in each level. No real issues with the game besides the first track ending in a loud buzzing way that messed with my concentration a few times although luckily you can simply choose a different song.  Edit: ...and it took me 3.4 more hours to get 60 seconds in each level, results may vary.  Great and an INSANELY fast/difficult avoid-em-up. Lots of replay value for the roughest of masochists!"
463180,Super Blue Fighter,"  When I played the first game I was like: what is this? When I played my second game I was still like that. It's just moving around and touching the right color, but at least it has trading cards."
463210,State of Anarchy,"this game makes the binding of issac and enter the gungeon look like a 200% easier game of the legend of zelda, THIS GAME IS THE MOST HARDCORE AND INTENSE BULLETHELL OBJECTIVEBASED ROGUELIKE TOPDOWN SHOOTER GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED 10/10 WOULD WATCH AI WALK INTO WALLS AGAIN  but seriously though, good game! i reccomend you buy."
463220,Dungeon of Zolthan,"Extremely short and basic, but fun."
463250,One Tower, Early Access Review
463270,Ghost 1.0,"A metroïdvania in a space station. You're Ghost, an agent that can litterally 'possess' a hull and others robots. You find/purchase numerous weapons and power ups.  It sounded nice, the cut scenes are good, as the humour and the graphics.  But: the commands are ill-distributed, confused, there's this 'sticky' feel when you try to perform jumps or rolls. Ghost is somewhat too slow. And directing your shots is a nightmare in the overall very confused fights.   Problem is, the focus of the combat was put on the number of hostiles in a cramped environment, more than on observation, real timing and tactical moves. It makes it a chore.  Plus, the environments are dull, and the music innerving.  Nice try, but thumb down and can do a lot better."
463290,Kismet,Just boring. There is only one game and its all chance based. The first time I played the Computer got 3 rerolls in a row then 2 in a row the next round. I get 2 rerolls in the whole game. There is no challenge. Its fun for a few minutes then your wishing you were playing a real game.
463320,The Sea Eternal,"I tried to like this game, I really did. I like so many of the other CoG games that have been released that I picked this one up day one.  Now I really wish I hadn't.  This game is less a game and feels more like an agenda is being pushed. I was forced to say or agree with things that the way I'd played my character didn't, and felt somewhat railroaded into some choices that I had to make. This is not good writing in a game engine that is all about 'choice' (something that is in its very name!)  I'm long past the ability to refund this preachy game, but I will *definitely* be taking the fact that this game was published into consideration when buying CoG games in the future!"
463350,Storm of Spears,"The game has a nice storyline, but it;s just not my type of game. I feel like I wouldv'e enjoyed this game if it wasn't pixlated. Honestly this game has great potintial, but pixel graphics just aren't my thing anymore."
46340,Theatre of War 2: Africa 1943,"This game is bad, really really bad one of the worst strategy games I have every played. Let us talk about the selling points of the product 1. The AI  The ghost in Pac man probably are more complex than the AI in this game.  a. There is no path finding. For example units will not follow roads, even in cases where you start them on roads, but will head in a straight line to their destination unit they hit something and must turn. There is a stage where you fight on the road between high cliffs. When the AI travels it does not follow the road but hits a straight line until it gets stuck on a hill side that is to steep so it turns a bit and repeats the procedure. So if the road has a curve to it the unit does not follow the curve but makes a zig zag motion til it reaches its destination b. AI allies are about worthless. There are stages where you fight and your re-enforcements are AI allies. Problem is the AI allies do not want to fight. Now most of the time they will fire on an enemy if they see him, but do nto expect them to go looking.  This really gets to be a a pain in missions where the ally AI is needed to win, in such cases its a 60/40 chance you are losing the mission c. units disappear. You will have a unit walking then all of a sudden its gone. Not shot at or in combat just gone, it's like the rapture  d. Units movement. You spend a lot of your time trying to get units to move. Now most of the time they will move when ordered, but there are many times they act liek your not even around. I am not talking a unit that is scared or injured but just under normal cases they simply do not want to move. 2. Line of Sight  I would love to meet the person who designed this system. It appears combat in WW2 involved both sides playing pick a boo. You will have two units within 10 feet of stopped looking at each other, only to have the enemy disappear, then reappear in the same spot. I have seen whole tanks be surrounded by enemy units (infantry and tanks) disappear then re appear. This gets to be a pain in missions where you need to prevent the enemy from breaking through. it sucks to be firing at that last tank only to have it engage its cloaking device  Stage design  For some reason the developers decided not make the player guess on how to complete missions. Sure you are giving an overview on what you need to do but never told how to do it. I know you are thinking, why do you want the game to walk you through it? That's not what I mean, what I mean is the developers put hidden triggers that only they know in order to complete a mission. For example You are to hold the line and defeat the enemy attack. Ok so you fight for a few minute and even get a 'Mission accomplished' alert. Ok good, so some time goes by and your are still playing. Well this is where the fun begins, see the game said you had to defeat teh attack, what it didn't say is that in order to complete the mission you need to have an infantry unit in some random building. Now if you are lucky it is just simple case of moving stuff around till you activate the trigger. If you are not so lucky the enemy keeps rescanning until you run out of men.  Final thought No doubt someone will come on here and claim I am not telling the truth. Well to them I say go look at the official reviews, most complain about the same issues. It is sad this is a great game when it works and could have been something if only the developers had the skills to deliver This game is one of the worse thing to come out on computer. It is clear the publisher is trying to fight against software piracy by creating stuff that is so bad , people would not even want to steal it."
463400,Spellbound, Early Access Review
463440,Retool,"In my own opinion this game isn't set up entirely well, for $7 I don't believe it is worth buying, it seems more like a game that should be a free flashplayer deal. But if you want to make your own decision before buying it you can check out my video of my first thoughts here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kccK88RaEBs "
463450,Bipolar Game,i actually had fun playing this.... 10/10
463460,"Resette's Prescription ~Book of memory, Swaying scale~","I'm really torn about this game. This game has a very interesting little story at its heart which will grab you if you give it the chance, but the overall game might not be worth your purchase (at least at full price).  So lets break this down:   Presentation"
46350,Real Warfare,"Real Warfare is one of those games you come across while browsing Medievil and Strategy games on Steam. Basically a discount Total War, it surprised me, graphics are not too bad and gameplay is tolerable. Along with the fact that pretty much anything can defeat anything which is also bad too. Cavalry is supposedly supposed to smash apart infantry however once deployed against Germanic infantry they have little to no affect. 8.1/10"
46360,Theatre of War 2: Kursk 1943 ,A very detail oriented game that probably gets a bum rap from those that charge into battle. To win you really need to take your time and choose units carefully depending on what you are trying to do. Scout area's first and take out the important targets. Pay attention to the skill levels of individual men. There is a lot of attention to detail here which rewards those that enjoy that type of thing.
463670,Runeyana, Early Access Review
46370,Rig 'n' Roll,if u put time in to the game u will see most these people are not playing any hours to lern or no the game well to make a point. if they had played long they would had seen there iS A GPS stystem u have to buy for your truck then u will no were to go. all and all its a hell of a great game even if it cost a 100$ noing what I no about the game I would had payed and amount of cash for it
463710,Puzzle Galaxies,"Considering Puzzle Galaxies describes itself as 'groundbreaking', the game has little to offer besides its core mechanic. As soon as the game introduces the mobile enemies a few levels in, you have basically seen the whole game. Additional difficulty only comes from a larger playing field, more different symbols, and faster enemies. There are long stretches of game where the difficulty doesn't change at all. The content stretching goes so far as requiring the player to play a level twice to complete it, but then again, does it really matter if I have to play 2 identical levels, or one level twice?   The only reason why I didn't refund the game is that it costs below 1€, so why bother."
463760,The Beggar's Ride,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
46380,Reign: Conflict of Nations,Very poor UI. This game turned me off in the tutorial when I had to search endlessly for the right city to send an ambassador to. Not streamlined at all and when I have to search the map for 30 minutes in an attempt to find the right city to send a unit to ... no TY.

463920,Initia: Elemental Arena,   Early Access Review
463930,The Dweller,"A short, fun, kind-of-cathartic little puzzle game. Well-presented and well-made, with appropriate atmosphere--despite the shortness of the game, it doesn't feel insubstantial. Even the story isn't too bad; I like how it lampshades and plays with horror tropes.   I'm a little disappointed that there seems to be no way to eat/defeat the wizard at the end, though--though that's a design/story choice I certainly understand.    I hope to see more games from this developer."
463980,Solitairica,"Better than I thought it was going to be. Nice sense of humor, good illustrations, interesting gameplay. Good little game if you like solitaire."
46400,Greed: Black Border,"First of all, this game is an isometric action sci-fi game. Very simple controls( basically left mouse button and shift). The story it's ok....The bosses fights are kinda easy...It took me around 10hrs to finish....i think it's a good game to spend some time"

464050,Heroes Must Die,"at the beginning it was good, gameplay was unique and everything but after a while it became too repeatative, it gets very annoying when you cant force thru or run on any fight, all battles will take a long time to finish, cant skip on any battle at all. from what i can tell i am already almost over but im already too lazy to finish it.  Pros: Unique gameplay Free Good music  Cons: Repeatative Gameplay Can't run away on battles Battle takes a long time to finish Cant save so when you quit you will start from the beginning of the scene, DOING.EVERY.BATTLE.AGAIN No level so this becomes a headache cause you cant finish the battle any faster REPEATATIVE GAMEPLAY (have to repeat this cause thats what the gameplay is like, very annoying)  im quitting it was fun at the beginning but got annoying."

464230,Colours of Magic: Aqua Teeter,"This game seems unfnished to me. It really does. Everythings functional, but theres not much there to hold my attention. There's this weird theme going on with the wizard that appears in the menu and such that never gets explained. There's only one music track and its very generic and forgettable. I know that this was originally a mobile game but I don't get why it's being sold on steam.  Pros: + Fully functional + Concept seems interesting  Cons: - Only one music track - Boring - Little story and nothing is explained - When I opened the game it runs this super shade command prompt window that made my anti-virus freak out - Spelling and grammar errors  The concept is interesting and could work as a fully fleshed out game, but it really failed to hold my attention for long. I only played 5 minutes and by then, I was already bored and regretting my purchase. So I suggest staying away from this one unless it gets fleshed out a bit more. I've already sent a refund request."

464360,3030 Deathwar Redux - A Space Odyssey,   Early Access Review
46440,Future Wars,Game won't even start. It keeps crashing after the developer credits.
464400,Bounce,"Great game all around. The graphics are amazing. Sometimes I just sit and stare through the windows for a while. The levels are pretty intense and take some time to work through. I love the lightbulb moment when I figure it out. I also love the music.   My only complaint is that in some levels, the physics seem inconsistent. It could just be me, but sometimes doing the exact same things without any outside influence (like gravity zones or moving objects) produces different trajectories. It could be some part of the mechanics of the game I don't understand, and it doesn't happen in many levels, but it does happen occasionally. Regardless, I'd recommend this game to anyone."
464440,Annie Amber,"Only spent a few minutes in the game. There's only so long I can look at circles and wait for my character to reach them before I go online and check if there's anything else to the game. There isn't really. The visuals are ok, but since you have to look at the circles to go to them, all you end up doing is looking at the circles, not the scenery."
464450,DoDonPachi Resurrection,"This game destroyed my free time many years back, and now that it's on steam with all the arrange modes (and you don't have to hack/get a japanese xbox to run them) is probably going to consume a couple more hours again.  First impressions are that the port is pretty well done and sports the features you'd expect of a decent port. All the arrange modes and main game modes for that price is quite the offer and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to pick up a real shmup."
464470,BloodGate, Early Access Review
464490,The Afterglow of Grisaia,If you love a backstory of Yuuji with Asako &amp; JB. This one is definitely must. Even though it last only 2 hours max. The story in this will fill some gap in Meikyuu. And Yuuji also get VA in this one too.  Try to get when it on a discount. That way you won't feel dissapoint much.
46450,Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes,Hilarious and a solid game
464540,Colosse,This is a very interesting little experience. It's free and it looks very nice. Try it. There's no reason not to.

464630,Secret Of The Royal Throne,This game was terrible. Puzzles were too easy and more for a young child. Some of the puzzles didn't make sense.
464690,Vroomist, Early Access Review
464700,Maui,"The funny thing is, I have been living in Hawaii;Maui my whole entire life (14 years) and I have never been to the mainland. This game though make me want to move from my majestic home and live somewhere else in the world. I have never, been anywhere else in my life but here in Maui but this game....just....just don't get it.    it's fine 4/10"
464780,ChuSingura46+1 S,"the first chapter was good, but the replayability isn't as much good in the later chapters. and it gets boring pretty easily. the biggest problem with time travel and looping is that it had to poorly follow the events that happened in history, with a little bit of modifying some bits here and there, but not truly utilizing this advantage of being from the future. In the end the MC pretty much lived by the rules and customs of Chusingura era. the 'gimmick' dies down fast, and what you have is just as what it is: history that you have to read multiple times in the further chapters while adding very little to the overall plot. it is truly very much skippable.  With that said, MC has big issues. he came from the future, yet his moral compass is just as low as these uneducated ronins. I can no longer count how many times I've been facepalming whenever the plot tells him to be timid. for example in chapter 5 (Emoshichi route, where I am currently reading),   He never told his supposed mother to get an effing job because her family is poor. nope, blame it on MC that the kids that got scammed when they were delivering opium.    Or that   Sayo not telling the Chamberlain that she is just Grim Reaper. She 'killed' her own father, and now her sister and brother are walking to the path of death and destruction. no, you have to be that little kid that gets easily manipulated by Death herself.    So yeah, can't really recommend the subsequent chapters. just play the first chapter. that's the only part it is good, and its free."
46480,Still Life,It is a great creepy crime mystery. Lots of puzzles. I enjoyed the story immensely.
464800,Twisted Worlds,"Interesting game...  I don't really know what I'm doing, but I read the instructions and do what they say to.  Recommended!"
464820,Awakening of Solutio,This game has very poor controls. The perspective for the game player is too small so you can't see what is coming and which results in dying often. Most annoying is that when you die you go back to the very start of the level instead of a point past the most recent hurdle that you overcame. Each time you die a voice says 'game over' - very frustrating.
464880,Stars in Shadow, Early Access Review
46490,Still Life 2,"That awful inventory management. What is this? An RPG? And in the combination with a horrible unresponsive controls and overall bad game design it's nothing but frustrating. Worst point &amp; click adventure game I've ever played. If you liked the first Still Life just stay away from this game (I didn't listen to the same advises and now I know I should, don't do the same mistake)."
464900,Pitfall Planet,"Pitfall Planet is a great couch co-op game to play with a friend. It's got great puzzles, cool secrets, and lots of hats. The game is very enjoyable to play for the puzzles alone, but the other half of fun comes from screwing around with your friend."
464940,Sketchfab VR,"This is certainly not what I expected, and from the discussions reflect the same.  This product is nothing merely more than a showcase of SketchFab's 'Currated' list. Sure it's a good list, but I thought the point of a program like this was to let you browse other's work. This is not the case.  Also when you look down at something to have a closer look, a UI Menu pops up and blocks vision, very poor foresight.  At this point in time WebVR is the only way to view SketchFab and even then I couldn't get it to run on the previous version of Chromium, will try with the next build."
464960,Hiiro,Relaxing and Short
46500,Syberia,This game is tough to review. Story was realtively interesting and gameplay too. That being said the main characters personality made me graon and the lack of accents for supposed russians made no sense. Overall it was a fun game.
465000,Event Horizon, Early Access Review
465060,EXZEAL,"Exzeal is a shmup that's built entirely around its scoring systems. If you like thinking about what you are doing and how you can do it better, this is a great game. If you just want to shoot stuff and dodge bullets though, this game is hard to recommend.  Many of the attack waves don't really do much, or have hard to reach hit boxes that don't make sense just shooting at normally. Instead, look at your ships attack type and how it gets bonuses, and how you can maximize each wave. There's a way to kill even the trickiest of enemies, and there's likely a different way to do it 'well'.  Exzeal has five ships to try out and they all play differently and have different solutions to the game's many puzzles. The XII Stag ship in particular is a nice addition for those who are familiar with it, and burning up enemies with your exhaust never gets old. Note: to play the hidden fifth ship, select type 3 with exactly 13 seconds left on the timer.  The biggest downside to this game is, oddly enough, hand fatigue. Two of the ships have a charge up mechanic, which can be sped up by rapidly rotating your joystick / thumb pad / keyboard fingers. The XII Stag ship has an auto-rotate button, however the others do not (this would have been a great addition). It's not as bad as Psyvariar games, but I definitely feel the burn after longer play sessions. I can just envision an arcade owner getting frustrated as players wear out the joysticks every week from spinning circles non-stop, hehe."
465070,TRIZEAL Remix,"I first played this on the Dreamcast, many years ago. I'm pleased to say it plays nice and smooth on PC, and although the graphics were never really designed with higher resolutions in mind, they are crisp and clear so visibility isn't an issue.  I'll be honest, Trizeal doesn't make the best first impression. As with all Triangle Service games, the first level is more of a tutorial on the scoring system and not much interesting happens. And yeah, even 10 years ago it wasn't exactly the prettiest shooter on the block.  Get to stage 3 though and things heat up quite a bit. By the time you get to the ending, you'll confront some interesting puzzles to work out. Pay attention to your weapons and how to use them, and the correct path will appear. Good luck!  The scoring system is based around medal chaining, however done mostly in short bursts of opportunity than a full-game run of perfection. Nothing too over the top here.  The Powerup system is pretty great once you figure out how the mix and matching works. When switching weapons, pay attention to how many items you've grabbed with that primary weapon, and how it becomes universal once you collected enough. Experiment a bit and it'll become clear.  I'll recommend this game to players who want to spend some time learning and conquering the game. For players that just want to load up a new game and blast stuff with instant gratification, honestly this is probably not the best game to get."
46510,Syberia 2,"Horrible graphics, horrible voice acting, horrible story line. Lots of running trough alot of empty screens, puzzles way too easy, and overall, lots of wasted time. I am not hating. Simply giving out the facts. Don't waste a penny on that game."
465130,Wicce,"F*** you, I spend 6 hours to play this game thrice because of the bug when using the boat. Now I can't make a refund, you win. Nice art and nice story with this piece of sh*t bug game, what a shame."
465150,Mars Odyssey,"This is a really short experience but really well done and informative. The quality is top notch but a one key suggestion to devs would be to allow for the landing experience when you leave the space station, to see an atmospheric approach and landing on Mars would be awesome and really enhance the entire experience."
465170,Crime Secrets: Crimson Lily,"This is a very short HOG. The story....its fun. I mean there is this killer and you are his prisoner every few minutes. Anyway, as most HOGs have a silly story it doesn't matter. So what about the gameplay? Its very very easy. A few times there is a little confusion because of missspelled objects, but most pictures have so few objects that you shouldn't have a problem with it. Could I recommend it? Not for the asked price. If you can get it for 1 - 2 € buy it."
465180,One day in London,"As I started to play, I wasn't so sure about this game, but the more time I spent with it, the more it caught my interest. The art is great and the story got me hooked. I can't wait for the next episode and see how this ends. My only gripe are the puzzles - I wish there was an option to skip them."
465190,Space Survival,"  This game is a really good game to relax too. It has good music to go along with the amazing space backgrounds. I played some while on the road it really made the time seem to fly by. The game mechanics are simple enough to where even small childern or older people could get into it. There's not much to it, It just involves using a few keys ( the mouse buttons and Q). I like how the game doesn't have a save feature, this is because i would play some simple games such as this and the save would become curropt or not work at all and that would result in me unistalling the app and reistalling it. So if something did happen i would just need to push restart. i would rate this game 4.75/5.0 the .25 off would be for a few bugs in the game, but nothing that is devestating.  Its a good early access game overall."

465310,Ricerca VR,"What was this about! A cyclist having a mid life crisis would be my best guess. It surprised me in that it is all animated on five big screens, I was expecting a static art gallery display so it was a plus and engaging all the more for this, I like all the different things the Vive brings to the table, Art installations to the gamer hell yeah! Support the different and diversify and as in the words of the Pop Group '**** art let's dance!'"
465360,Uprising: Join or Die,"Bundling old farts with emulators is unacceptable, no matter how good the game was back in the old days. You basically get 3dfx emlator without an easy way to fix the settings. Pure publisher trash. The game itself was genre defining back then, an attempt to mix FPS and RTS. But it never was popular enough, so we only have this and Battle Zone. Should you buy it? I think it's overpriced for the way it is. Just in case if you're nostalgic."
46540,Trapped Dead,"As of day one, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's uber difficult, barely any tutorial, absolutely no support as far as multiplayer goes, and you're forced to play through the single player to UNLOCK multiplayer options.  Even on sale, I want my $7.40 back"

46550,Post Mortem,"The story is OK. The graphics is simple, but OK for its genre.  Though there are some flaws in implementation.  Might be suitable to a fans of the genre who would like to connect it with the stories of more recent successors of this game.   Better buy Still Life 2."
465510,Sinful Eden,my god it took awhile to complete but i got there still it was too cheasy and barely tolerble in small doses only the most paitiant can win this game still i finally got all five ending hazar anyway its way too cheasy for my likeing and i dont think ill play it again anythime soon 3/10
465520,PRICE,"PRICE is a ~1 hour puzzle game. The gameplay is basic point and click adventure formula, but effort has been put in the music and the storytelling, producing an engaging and atmospheric result. Definitely worth the time it takes to play through."
465540,Adventure World,"I found myself disappointed by this game. It has some good points, but overall, it was a grind for little satisfaction.  Pros: Hilarious defeats - I laughed my ♥♥♥ off more than once  Cons: Clunky controls Frequent defeats The need to grind levels and experience to avoid defeats Repetitive and boring combat Really short story No actual nudity, though the game is tagged with nudity - no exposed female nipples or groins  The promised nudity was not delivered and is not available because the developer fears the Steam banhammer. There is no patch available. There was one available temporarily, but the developer took it down from the site where it was hosted as a paid download. Kind of a let down, since I thought that a game tagged with Nudity might contain nudity. Maybe I have a different definition of nudity? The closest you will see in this game is Alisa in her leather underwear when her armor is totally broken and hanging in tatters from her body. I think the patch allowed armor damage to go a step or two further.  Combat is somewhat difficult to get the hang of, but once mastered, it's not too bad. However, enemies are quite strong, and they will regularly hand you your ♥♥♥ after removing it from their boot after your ♥♥♥ detaches from your body after they plant said boot inside.  It's funny what can happen when you are defeated, but you usually have to spend money that you no longer have to re-equip yourself, meaning that you are forced to either do bad things to get money that will then prevent you from spending that money because everyone will hate you, or you have to go back and fight the baddies without proper equipement to get some money. This leads to a lot of heading into a dungeon, having a single fight, and then leaving before another defeat. "
46560,Robin Hood,The game don't run on Windows 10 and only has a max resulotion of 1024x768! The publisher 'Microids' do nothing and only earn money for greate games like this. At the moment we can only play with a stretched viev and a unstable 'community-fix'.  With the sourcecode it would be very simple to make a greater or dynamic resolution by editing the vievpoint and cutting the UI.
465660,Franchise Hockey Manager 3,"Too long to load even with a gtx 770 and amd 8350. hard to understand and first not worth trying to figure out. I like hockey games but realised they have a small presence on PC, this game isn't the awnser. Good idea though, needs updates."
465670,Project G,"A poor side scrolling shmup. Very slow paced, very easy, lots of dead-air, ridiculously huge hitboxes. No scoring potential. Sometimes enemies shoot after they die.  Having said all that, I bought it in the sale for £1.67 and I've had 4 hours of relaxing fun running through it and upgrading the ships so it still gets a thumbs up."

465750,Tank Battle: North Africa,Don't expect much in this game
465780,NewRetroArcade: Neon,"This is an EA title and should be marked as such. I'm investing in the idea but it does need some love. Check the demo out, first. The Vive trackpad (D-Pad) controls are a little off so I have a Xbox One controller I use as a backup. VOIP needs to be implemented. Sharing movies works via YouTube streaming or by having the same movie file in the same directory on each participating multiplayer computer.  Why get it now?  You can: - Play emulated games solo. - Listen to cool music. - Watch movies with friends. - Play Air Hockey, bowling, basketball, skeet shooting, darts, a rails zombie shooter, a Flappy Bird knock off (by default), and a single stick multiplayer shooter.  Why get it later?  Hopefully, we can: - Have virtual couch co-op/game streaming. - Compete with high scores.  I'd consider the game in Alpha because it's not feature complete. There are some known bugs and the multiplayer isn't finished. We'll get there.  Update: It's been a few months and I've yet to see any progress regarding server hosting and game streaming. This was one of the majors draws to the game and whenever requested the dev team says it's simply too hard. However, between adopting something like Valve's Source hosting system wherein all of the host's files are downloaded by the client, and the success of streaming in Unity, sharing an arcade space is definitely possible.  This game is an atmospheric, single player getaway for your oldschool needs. However, it's much easier to put these games up on your monitor/TV than go through the trouble of implementing them here. With RetroPie for the Rasberry Pi and other means of realizing a retro arcade experience this game simply isn't worthwhile (yet) without a more complete multiplayer experience. I go to Barcade to compete in high scores with friends/strangers. I can't do that here and therefore this game has been a nice, experimental escape, but doesn't have enough content to hold my attention. Arcades are about socializing and this game, right now, doesn't do a great job of that. I go to arcades to play arcade games; not just bowl or play arcade basketball.  So here's to the developers realizing that somehow, at some point in the near future, before interest truly wanes."
465840,THE LAST BLADE,"Got this from the humble bundle. I'm only giving this a thumbs up with the hopes of this game doing well and SNK releasing the Code Mystics port of Last Blade 2 on steam, or even putting out Last Blade 3. Great game, ♥♥♥♥ port, stick with fightcade/your emulator of choice."
465870,SHOCK TROOPERS 2nd Squad,Another disappointment courtesy of DotEmu. Persistent slowdowns and 2-3 second frame skips ruin the experience. This type of port may have been acceptable in the PSone era but this is 2016 for crying out loud. Don't waste your money on this port.
465990,Hidden Expedition: The Crown of Solomon Collector's Edition,"Great point and click game, with some hidden object tasks, and puzzles."
46600,Swarm Arena,"In my opinion this game is a little hidden gem. Not many people play it anymore and its a shame. Nice clean graphics, simple controls and an interesting 'teach your A.I.' mode. From time to time it goes on sale for less than 1e/1$, buy it, you wont regret it ;)"
466000,Maze: Subject 360 Collector's Edition,"Very nice game! A little bit creepy, a little bit spooky. And a little bit similar from other hidden object games. :o) Enjoyed it to go through the story. :oD"
466010,Nevertales: The Beauty Within Collector's Edition,This game was one of the better hidden object games. I really enjoyed it. The best part was the bonus game and the bonus bonus game. It was fun to go back to find objects I had missed and redo the hidden object sections I did not do well in. I have now played two madhead games and they were both very good. Please would steam get more of their games for us to play.
466040,Pet Store Panic,"It's a fun game, I really like it."
466060,Shiver: Vanishing Hitchhiker Collector's Edition,"It was pure luck that I recognized this game as being one probably published by Big Fish Games. Indeed, I've come back to Neoseeker and I am currently adding many casual adventures/HO games. The series Shiver was one of these planned to be added soon. By releasing the game here, BFG prompted me to quicken the process.  However, I couldn't resist the purchase, as it was close to the kind of ambiance I prefer for this kind of game. So, in the end, was it really worth of my wallet?  You took a hitchhiker with you and let her go at Gordon Creek. However, the teddy bear she forgets looked like one in your childhood and decided to give it back to the mysterious girl. But did you really expect to find her easily in that gloomy and deserted town?  The plot was beginning well: a mysterious sad woman, a teddy bear, a gloomy town, anything that can be tied to a psychological game, with people being used for experiments... My imagination was running so wild that in the end, the story seemed to be a little disappointing. I still don't understand why the little boy leads you to finish your quest, when you're clearly on your way to find the truth. And the extra chapter should have been included in the main story. It would have been more logical for the plot.  Anyway, the gameplay is the same as any other game of the kind: you find items, you use them, you solve puzzles, though they're rare, you clear hidden objects scenes. The novelty here is the fact that you're carrying a flashlight and a camera with you, used to lit darker areas and to take pictures. You can take them anytime but there are moments where you need to do that to go forward. Generally, it will blink to show you that you need the picture of a vision or a ghost.  If I have a regret, it's probably for the hidden objects scenes: some objects aren't really visible and given the dark nature of the game, it's not really helping.  The graphics are really good for the ambiance, though I would have probably liked a more developed burial site. It would have strengthened the supernatural side than what happened in the town or on the island.  The soundtrack is really nice too and very fitting. However, the voice acting could have been better: I didn't feel like the man had really emotions.  As a collector's edition, you'll find the bonus chapter, concept arts, etc.. Nothing really extraordinary, as some other games are more furnished for that domain.  Anyway, Shiver: Vanishing Hitchhiker disappointed me because I was expecting something else but is a good moment to pass. However, I find the price a little too high for what it is really. I do hope that Big Fish Games will finally understand that participating in sales on Steam can be a good idea, like they did with Mystery Cases Files, where I ended up buying those discounted. Because if they're discounting other games like Awakening, Dark Tales, Otherworld or even Dark Parables, I would acquire them without problems."

466170,Idling to Rule the Gods,"I like to start off saying I like this game, here is what I think of the game so far. As of typing this up, I am currently at trying to beat the river god.    Pros:    *Free. You will see why there is a asterisk in the cons below.    I havent played a idling game in a long time, this game got me back into the idling games.    You can customize your character's avatar over time as your character grows.    When rebirthing, the past people you won against are much easier.    If you are into reading, the story is a nice read. Might want to check at the story tab after each god you beat. (kinda feels like shadow clones are a rip from Naruto by the way)    Cons:    There are microtransactions, listed below Cons.    Game has a simple UI, like really simple. I sometimes get lost though, forgetting I pushed in a button that I have to click again to get out of, so you have to get used to that.    When rebirthing, the future eneimes become slower to progress to beat over time. When you get to where I am, you will find yourself going AFK a lot and not doing as much micromanaging things.    If you dont like the idea of idling most of the time and/or keeping the game in the background a lot, dont bother getting the game, thats what a idling game is mainly about.  If you want to know about the microtransactions, here is a full list (in USD):   God Power: Used to get temporary or perminant buffs    (can be obtained for free for playing the game, get 2x for first purchase)    5 for $2.50    25 for $10.50    50 for $19.90    100 for $35.00     Lucky Draws: You get random stuff.    (can be obtained for free, once every 24 hours)    1 for $0.99    10 for $8.90    50 for $35.00    Daily Packs: Get a additional Lucky Draw and 2 God Power once a day.

466210,Race & Destroy,"Okay, I bought this game and after only a couple of minutes I deem it a waste of hard drive space, even if it´s just a 2GB download. I was expecting something like the flash based games I enjoyed in my youth like need for madness and the like. Turns out those 10 year old browser games are still superior in terms of gameplay, and, suprisingly, even graphics."

466350,Fossil Echo,"I played this though the first few campfire scenes before stopping. Really, really don't recommend. The graphics are lovely and the music is fitting, but that's about it. The gameplay is tedious, frustrating, and repetitive. The archways with the glowing insignia lead to especially irritating jump sequences and are easy to accidentally pass by without realizing that you can't get back to them once you've walked pass. It feels like the developers wanted to create a short animated film but threw in some nominal gameplay just for the heck of it. If you want to play a well-developed stealth platformer with a great story and graphics, go check out 'Mark of the Ninja' instead."
466420,Warriors' Wrath,"It's not bad, but its not super good. id say it was worth the money, and it was fun. looked good to for a 7 buck game."
466430,Choice of Alexandria,"Shorter than other Choice of Robots, this game is well-written with just the right amount of both humor and historical detail. I've played it through twice, making about half of the same choices as the first time and felt invested in having a positive outcome for both my character and Ptolemy IV. It was worth the $3 that I'd paid for it, but I would have preferred more content, especially with more opportunities to build rapport and/or emnity with the NPCs."
466490,Princess Isabella: The Rise of an Heir,"The quality of this games does not feel like it is an Artifex Mundi game, it has poor visual quality and story line."
466500,35MM,"Scenery is nice and atmosphere is definitely strong, but the gameplay is frustrating and the overall game is very slow and very buggy."
466580,GOD's DEATH,"  Table of Contents: - Foreword - Graphics - Gameplay - Sounds - Controls - Quality - Overall Experience   -Foreword I dont really mind too much about games being bad since i get them for free, but this one was just a waste of time. Honestly, if i'd have spent money on that ♥♥♥♥ i would have refunded (would be my first refund) and get 8 games worth 50 cents... I was soooo bored trying to get over 20 minutes of playtime.  -Graphics Bad. Really bad. To be honest the worst graphics i've ever seen. I've never seen a worse game than this in general, and i though Super Space Pug was bad...  -Gameplay This is where it gets... weird. Im not really a huge fan of Visual Novels and dialogue stuff, the only games i played and enjoyed so far includning much dialogue were 'Katawa Shoujo' (a great game btw, its for free ;)) and 'If my heart had wings'. This though wasnt enjoyable at all. The english seemed pretty poor, the first 20 Minutes were just walking a path without being able to explore, you simply had to go where the game wanted you to. Reminds me of the CoD Story Modes, boring, the game simply plays itself, you just walk... The Battle-System is crap, you can either choose between 'Magic Attack' (Which includes 'Hands' and 'Hands II' ...), 'Items' and something else i forgot...  -Sounds The only thing that kinda saves this game from not being the worst ♥♥♥♥ ever was the soundtrack. I enjoyed it. Its pretty good, compared to the rest of the game. The only part that was total ♥♥♥♥ about it so far was the first Kingdom. Reminds me of some Disco-Music from the 70's, not even. Simply that Dracula Sound (That dadadaaaaa, i dont know what its called) with a really weird beat in the background...  -Controls The Controls are simply arrow keys, 'Enter' and 'X' which is a pretty bad combination because that requires me to use both hands on a game i could play with one hand.  -Quality I did experience some issues with the game mechanics, you cant walk into water, but kinda glitch yourself around on the edges (reminded me of Panfu). The English is poor, the game in general does not have high quality at all.   -Overall Experience I would definetly not recommend that game. I've heared its an RPG Maker game, i dont know much about RPG Maker, but i know there are insanely many (much better) RPG-Maker games out there (For example, 'Corspe Party' had an amazing story.)"
466660,Stash, Early Access Review
466720,Vintage VR,this game is so boring
466730,King's Guard TD,"  I won't give this game a positive review because I received a free key.  As soon as you start this game, it's pretty fun, I admit it. Spend an hour into it and the farming begins, it'll be very hard to update, upgrade or keep up at all, it's buggy, glitchy and it just feels like a mobile game, should've went on the Android Market instead."
466780,Prehistoric Tales,"Battles are pretty easy beatable at end game,"
466800,The Dope Game,It's a really dope game.
466820,Zenodyne R,"Zenodyne R is one of the best indie shmups on Steam.   The graphics are very well done and look exactly like they would have appeared in late-80s/early-90s. It looks like it could have been a Taoplan game!   The music is the same--sounding exactly like you remember those old Genesis games from your youth sounding.   The gameplay is fast and furious, but not cheap: you can usually dodge things that you see coming without having to memorize the entire game.   The story actually works within the the game without getting in the way if you want to ignore it.   Each level is unique with it's own visual feel and special gameplay. Unlike some other games in this genre, you will remember each level individually.   The game's difficulty is hard, but fair. While the difficulty feels uneven in some areas, the way difficulty is adjusted for normal difficulty is primarily through how often extends are doled out, which allows less-experienced players to beat the game and not feel like they missed out on too much. Veteran players will find a very challenging game that mixes both modern and classic shoot 'em up elements.   Branching paths provide some replay value and makes experimenting with different routes through the game feel less boring than other shmups.  "
466870,Aurora Nights,"It's probably not the best way to learn the constellations long-term. (Well, thinks the game, you've got this one right three times. Three whole times! Clearly you'll remember it forever now.)  Still, it's pretty, it's atmospheric, it's cheap, and it's hard to knock."
466890,Z.I.O.N.,Bad gameplay... buggy and glitchy.. World / map is empty... been wandering around and wondering what to do and where to go... I think it's another incomplete business...  2/10
466900,Hide & Spook: The Haunted Alchemist,"This is a super fun game, not really scary but very entertaining. This is better and more novel than many games you pay for. Get this one and two friends and have fun!"
466910,Worm.is: The Game,It's a game. Play it or I will kick your ♥♥♥♥ off.
466920,Mugen Souls Z,"Buy this to support cherami leigh. You will buy her game, right?"
466940,The Sandbox Evolution,"Great sandbox/game/world creator, the only major flaw for me was it's an online only game which is pointless other than downloading/uploading your creations, obviously!  100% dealbreaker for me but I still recommend! 100%  10/10 would buy an offline version"

46700,Ironclads: American Civil War,"Best game ever made, it blows Portal 1 and 2 out of the water."
467010,Fall of Civilization, Early Access Review
467090,A Game of Changes,I'm lovin' it. Would love to get more games like this to play and review.
46710,Ironclads: High Seas,"Bad, just bad. It's a very boring and dull game with few game mechanics and I suggest steering to port at 125 degrees before you hit this iceberg of a game."
467170,Subterrarium,"kinda short, and needs more challenge puzzles, but the mechanic is enjoyable and the game is oddly addictive."
46720,Dimensity,"This game is like having to poop but it wont come out, EVER!"
467210,Evo Explores,This game would make the artist M.C. Escher proud as this game shares similar optical illusion styles. I find this game unique and entertaining.
467290,Starship Titanic,"Starship Titanic is a callback to an earlier time in video games. I picked this up on a whim when it was first released. I still have the CD's, but I was still perfectly willing to buy a new copy on Steam just so I can play it again on modern OS's without having to fiddle through a thousand toggles and settings.   I'm going to start off with the bad. This game was put out when full motion video was a reasonably new invention, and consequently has some features that may annoy modern gamers. The most obvious are the repetitive scene transitions. Anywhere you go, you will be treated to a little video showing you wandering the that direction, admiring the sights, floating down canals, riding the lifts, etc. There is an obvious degree of 'look what CD Roms can do!' peppered all over the place, and it is in desparate need of an HD update. Some of the puzzles are a touch unforgiving, and it is not always clear where you should be going... so you get to see these scenes over and over and over. And over. Once more.   Otherwise, this is a stellar game. The scenery is quite nice. The design of the Starship and its android crew are all very creative. The premise and story are fun, and you get a real sense of accomplishment when you figure out the solutions to some of the nastier puzzles. The dialog is about what you would expect from Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), hilarious and vastly entertaining.   In short, this is not an action filled game. It's a slow wander around a derelict luxury starship, repairing things as you go and uncovering clues to what happened to the ship while you try desperately to upgrade to a 1st class room. It won't appeal to those who can't go a dozen steps without shooting something in the face, to those who are easily frustrated by logic problems, or to those who refuse to accept that the most useful thing in the Universe is your towel. To everyone else, get a copy. You'll have fun. :)"
46730,Hazen: The Dark Whispers,This game has not aged well. Only play it if you are desperate.
467310,Rogue Port - Red Nightmare,  i was one of the early beta testers for this game and loved it from the start recomended. youtube review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Lwzu8PyjE  Plz leave a like and sub also buy this game for only $5usd it's a must buy for RPG Enthusiast.
467320,God of Word,"Oh jeez, this gam is gret.  I luv the ansent greks, their my favrite subjet in histry clas. The muvie 300 is greT! Tis game is hrd and tugh, but far its rlly helpd me with tiping   I juzt thought the midissa an it ws soo spoookt  11/10, I like this game."
467360,Off-Peak,"This game is to be described by one word only: weird. Don't get me wrong, it's the good kind of weird. The music is absolutely fantastic, it brings a lot of atmosphere to the game. Also, it's quite relaxing. The characters are weird as well, some of them have disproportionate bodies, like huge heads.   So, you're stranded at this huge station, filled with gorgeous, eerie and weird art. The goal is to get out of the station by finding pieces of a ticket to make it whole. If you enjoy experimental games, I would surely give this a try. Especially since it's completely free!"
467370,Escape This,"  Digital Garbage... oh wait! It's not the same 'talent studio', but (poor) quality hints me different. :)"
467380,Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls,Destroy All Them Monster Girls !!!
467390,Approaching Blocks,"Bought this game because i had a coupon. Wasn't expecting too much. This game is however quite entertaining and requires concentration. I found it to be a good release. However the keyboard controls are quite twitchy, so I'd recommend using a controller. Also one of the pros of this game is that there are achievements and they are quite easy to earn. Easy game to get a perfected game (achievements) into your profile. However, some of the translations for the language part are kinda wrong. "
46740,World Basketball Manager 2010,"I do not recommend this one. Bought because I thought I would enjoy a game with all the management aspects of basketball. It is not a good game, the UI is all over the place plus not it is very dated."
467430,Farming 6-in-1 bundle,"This game is not just a game. It's something completely different. It changed my life, I think it's for the better. The emotional value this game has given is too great for me to fully comprehend. I can't even begin to explain the joy I've gotten playing My Farm Life 2 on here. It is honestly by far the most life changing event that has ever happened to me in all my years of life. I've invested so much into this game that my friends and family are starting to worry about me. I don't know how much more I can take. I've gone to rehab because I've become addicted to these games. Professional help has not helped me at all. If anything, my addiction has only grown stronger. I've lost almost all of the friends I have. The friends I do have remaining just don't believe that it can be this good, so I bought it for one of them. It has changed thier life, and I believe he might be falling down into the addiction that these games will bring. I can't bear to play any other game anymore. I've become to enveloped into this hell that I can't turn back. I believe that the only way for me to truly escape now is to end it all. So after I finish writing this review, I'm going to end it. So to you readers of this, I urge you, stay away. Goodbye."
467480,C O S M, Early Access Review
46750,Dark Fall: Lost Souls,"I wanted to like this game. I tried several times to play from start to finish. I am thus unsuccessful. The game would definitely benefit from an Objectives concept to guide players, as well as making the game more 'dummy proof' (and maybe a couple glitch fixes). I had to restart 3 times due to getting stuck by encountering glitches, or being unable to progress further due to missing items that I had little to no knowledge of. (this is where an objective would help). As well, the movement was difficult to work with; Too little control over the character made gameplay dull, and the turns were frustrating due to the lack of speed in which the character made them. Very confusing map in my opinion.   This game definitely has potential, and I plan on picking away at it down the road. I haven't given up on it yet, but for now, I will have to give this game a lack of recommendation."
467520,Power & Revolution,Bug Simulator 4   Still same bugs same crappy UI... The idea and details of this game is respectable but nothing more.. 
46760,Ironclads: Schleswig War 1864,♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  FYLLA B O Y S
46770,Making History II: The War of the World,"This is yet another Steam game that does not work.  I am getting really ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with Steam.  They are arrogant, they seem to think they can just ♥♥♥♥ on you and treat you like crap and I have had a ♥♥♥♥ing belly full of these ♥♥♥♥♥.  3rd game this year that does not work, costing me nearly £200, because the game ARK does not work and I purchased a server. They refused to refund me then, and they will refuse to refund me for this game as well.  The problem with this game, is it does not reload the games you have saved. Massive and aggravating glitch that makes this game unplayable. The second issue is that on the adertising it says that this game is multi-player. Again, another lie from Steam and it is time now to just go ahead and sue them.  It is not just me who has been suffering from poor gaming experiences with Steam, it is hundreds, if not thousands of people and now it is time to basically ♥♥♥♥ them up the ♥♥♥♥ and deal with them once and for all.  Steam, I warned you, over and over again and you have ignored my warnings.  Now I am going to sue you and I will be looking to group sue you with other people to force you to give back full refunds on all the games that do not work.   Your arrogant ♥♥♥♥ holes."
467760,Trapper's Delight, Early Access Review
467780,simian.interface++,"Its an... Okay game thats flashy, has nice music but doesnt really have much in the way of substance and is well over and done with around 15-20 minutes. Maybe stretch that a little to half an hour with the bonus stuff. It doesnt help that the majority of this game can be found for free on sites such as Kongregate. Oh well."
467790,Crongdor the Barbarian, Early Access Review
467820,Zero G Arena, Early Access Review
467850,METAGAL,"Well, as you can guess this game takes some inspiration from the Mega Man franchise, but stands well enough on its own. Though I have to warn new players that the stage design is somewhat unforgiving here and there. The artwork, boss battles and music are also enjoyable. At the €3,49 pricetag its definitely worth your money."
467890,Garage Drummer VR, Early Access Review
46790,Armada 2526,"Do not purchase this game If you have a Nvidia card. There is a workaround by lowering shadow to Lowest setting, but in my case, as well as other laptop users; the game still crashes at the beginning of a battle. Seems really simple for a 4x game from my experience. I think this game is just a funding scam personally, but I have no evidence to back that up."
467900,SWORDY, Early Access Review
467910,EPΘCH,"Epoch claims to be a mix of Zelda, Metroid, and Dark Souls...and I find that's a pretty accurate description, BUT none of those games were indie games. This game, on the other hand has a very low budget feel. I've almost put the game down 3 times, but after checking the forums, I've found what I was doing wrong (either not paying attention to clues, missing hidden objects/doors, confusion over how to play, etc.) and played on. Now, that I'm making progress rather steadily and feel I have a pretty good understanding of the game I LOVE IT! Great fun! OST is great! Controls are a little clunky, but that could just be me bc I hate the whole keyboard thing sometimes (however, after i figured out how to get the controls set up on my steam controller I have been owning.) One honest complaint I have is that the instructions on how to play are oversimplified and lacking. I still have no idea why my wand won't shoot more than 20x. also the inventory screen sucks! i can't throw away notes and there aren't pages. that part is annoying. Anyway, if you get frustrated easily and don't want to spend time searching the forum for help when you get stuck or frustrated or confused about how to play, then this game probably isn't for you. On the otherhand, if you like a challenge, pixel art, retro gaming music, and the idea of a Zelda/Metroid/Dark Souls mix, then you will love it like I do."
467930,SMASHING THE BATTLE,Grinding hack and slash. Perfect for mobile devices but not PC.
467940,Memoir En Code: Reissue,"   https://youtu.be/213XYI2CqXI   This tastefully made made game that has quite the backstory. Each little scene is a reflection from the developers life - allowing you to interact with the scene and deside what it meant to the developer and to you. You can also see developer comments to learn more about what is going on in each chapter - I would recomened taking the time to read each of these comments as it adds so much more story into the game. Clearly this narrative is personal and with that you really get to see a window into someone else's life. Its a very well made, visually pleasing, game."
467950,Survive in Space,the arabic language is broken
467960,Home Behind,"I was looking forward to this game for quite a while, and waiting on the translation to English.  Alas, either the translation is *terrible*, or the initial 'script' was just garbage. Your interaction is limited to objects directly in front of you, so if an NPC wander just a pixel past you, you can't interact with them. I mean, you're stood right beside them, but talk to them? Nope.  The combat is a bit of a click-fest with no real feedback indicating that you're clicking at the right moment to trigger combos, and the skill options are pretty unintuitive. The crafting interface is incredibly clunky.  Bought it on sale, requested a refund less than an hour later........"
467990,Versus: Battle of the Gladiator,"Low population, for the first hour I thought I was the only one playing.  Then I realized everyone is on the EU servers. And it was still low.  The combat controls are fluid, yet stiff. I can't really place my finger on it. I don't know if it's the smaller-than-character hitboxes or weird netcoding.  But some clean hits just don't connect sometimes. More likely to be the small hitboxes. I might just be bad and not get how it works.  Then again grappling can connect feet away from characters, so there's that.  It's a fun game nontheless. But it needs to be worked on for a better experience. All in all I can't reccomend. It just feels incomplete and untuned in all aspects."
468050,The Last Time,A good short story that is worth every minute.   Pros: -Amusing dialogue options -Nice little story -Cool art style -Good pacing  Cons: -A little short  Just buy it and enjoy the journey. It's an experience and a game.
468080,Occurrence at JCR Outpost,"I died because you can't carry a weapon and a computer program tape at the same time, and you can't escape a room with one door. Very realistic."
468110,Rescuties! VR,One of the greatest ideas I've seen for a VR game so far!!
468150,Trap House,Without online multiplayer this game has you rely on hooking up gamepads and playing with local friends. Not to mention it forces you to create/sync up a steam account. Which can be good but without an online mode this seems rather pointless other than character looks. Main issues is that it's not very user friendly and what if you don't have any local friends? Well you have the AI but that does get boring quick. I'd not recommend it until some sort of online feature is implemented.
468160,Ancient Go, Early Access Review
468240,VR Regatta - The Sailing Game, Early Access Review
46830,Ironclads: Anglo Russian War 1866,"absolutely horrible game. matches are 3 hours long, unable to make them any faster, damage is totally random. and the game crashes usually half an hour into every match, which results in forcing a computer reboot to close the game."
468310,She Wants Me Dead, Great game that is like limbo.
468320,Mini Golf Mundo,I have almost 800 games in my library and I keep playing this...
46840,Ironclads: Chincha Islands War 1866,Got it for free in an indy pack. Huge POS.
468490,Neon Space,"It's a very novel idea. Fairly well executed, and the soundtrack isn't bad. I bought it as a time-killer for a few cents, and it's worth doing the same when it's on sale."
46850,Zombie Pirates,I got this game rather cheap and think its kinda fun. I don't know that its worth a 14.99 pricetag though.
468530,A Date in the Park,"To be fair, I enjoyed it when I started; but I am completely baffled that anyone gave this a positive review. The majority of this short game is spent backtracking to previously explored areas; and the ending is the most predictable and disappointing thing imaginable. It also has pointless elements that can be interacted with but serve no purpose. Who knows, maybe you can do something with that stuff in the PAID COLLECTOR'S EDITION DLC   But hey, let's cut a bit of slack here, it's a free game.  Then again, it can't refund my time."
468560,Blind Trust,"Its free so you're not exactly lose anything if you download it, but its buggy, crashes a lot, has no multiplayer servesr requiring youyt to try evolv eor Hamachi, but even those tools won't work reliably, adn they have no option to skip the tutorial whcih permanently locks you unles you can find a way to get around it or get extremely lucky.  WE hear its very good but the Turiral is so buggy and broken that you can't even progress past it. Which they have no excuse for it to be so ploblamatic, at least patching in the ability to skip past it woud be neccessary. Until major changes for the game comes in, stay well far away."
468700,NVIDIA® VR Funhouse,Wow! i play for 3 mins and get riddled with FPS issues. I wouldnt bother unless u lie spending 1 hour trying to pairing you vive controllers each time it crashes.
468740,Snow Fortress, Early Access Review
468780,The Concourse,"  The Concourse made by A &amp; B Game studios can be compared to games such as Mirrors Edge which I thoroughly enjoyed for the parkour running. This game although looking good in the photos is poorly optimised, lacking single player bots or an actual tutorial while you are playing. The developers have not updated the game since my first playthrough over a week ago even promising to add ai, the multiplayer is dead so you will need to have a friend which owns the game to have any sort of competition or fun. I did like the idea of obstacles, however when sliding under moving blocks the hitbox was buggy and ruined the experience. There is no timer when playing single player, no way to track record times on a course and the developers promise to update the game with features that should be in the game at launch.   At the moment, all reviews made on this game are from community members with few reviews claiming that the multiplayer is active, although less than one hour has been played of The Concourse by the user. Other reviews focus on recommending the game, I simply cannot recommend this game at the current state unless the devs fix the issues with gameplay. This game has potential with the idea. I truly wanted to recommend this game, however, is poorly executed and simply is not fun.   *Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*"
468800,Arkshot,"Looks fun but unfortunately there is no one playing it, at all. The game suggested I make a game since there were none but no one ever joined so I can only play the training area which is about 5 minutes worth of fun before I get bored. Game looks good but I can't recommend it if I have yet to see another player online."
468820,Titans of Space PLUS, Early Access Review
468900,3D Sprite Renderer and Convex Hull Editor,Doesn't seem to work on 64bits. Also seems to restart over and over. Tried before and after rebooting.
468930,Phantaruk,"I just purchased this game and am unable to pick up anything that appears to be available. I searched the discussions for this game in the community section, but I could not find anything. I want my money back!!!!!!!"
469560,Bowling for VR,"Very fun game! I have been wanting an accurate sports game to play with the Vive using the hand controllers, and this game seems like less of a gimmick and more of what it would feel like to go to an actual bowling alley. I've even hit pins dead on, but I don't get spares or strikes unless I add extra spin to the ball which is what happens to me when I actually go bowling! This game really challenges my bowling skills and forces me to improve. The scenery is an extra bonus that is really relaxing and enjoyable to look at, especially in VR. Overall it's a very enjoyable game that I would recommend to anyone interested in bowling or just to have a good time."
469650,Disney Movies VR,"nice demo, small start. expect a lot more to come from disney!!! maybe add a theatre with 3d movies you can watch... (or that short track where black-and-white mickey jumps out of the screen)"
469710,Shattered Throne,  Been playing this for a little while and I must say it definitely has that 'Advance Wars' vibe Advance Wars was one of my favourite game series on the original Nintendo DS its a shame they haven't continued it recently but now I have this and I am sure I will enjoy it constantly as I eventually delve into online
469730,Super Mega Neo Pug,I have some of the other Pug games by these developers and they're super cute and addicting. I think this one is my favorite. The obsticales are still random but in a cool way. I also like the option of the power ups and having to go through various waves of bosses. Nice little time sink.
469820,Genital Jousting, Early Access Review
469890,Space Codex,"Nah, I don't get how this game got so many positive reviews. No fun at all, no challenge, keys are not bindable,... The only interesting point if you're into achievements is that you can 100% the game within 10 minuts. Otherwise, save your time and money."
469920,hackmud,"it was fun for a while; but at this point the game changes too much to call it finished. =&gt; ie airgaps become vulnerable etc...  Better spend you money on screeps if you are into programming games! (screeps also has a private server, so no need for expensive subscriptions)"
469930,Pandum online,Interface and control style are an abomination. I cannot play this any more.
469980,Legend of Miro,"The pictures and the video looked interesting enough for me to buy this game, even though the game description is kinda awkward. I mean, a story that will show me what's important in life? Well, we will see. You begin the game in a house, with obviously no memory and..no clue what to do. As you can see in my video, the start is kinda rough because you have no directions or whatsoever.   https://youtu.be/okYHxzVEr20   Even with the weird beginning, I'll continue to play this game because I'm curious what will happen. The graphics are okay, I guess it was build with RPG Maker and the sound is fitting."
469990,NEKOPALIVE,Am I missing something here? This isn't a game...
47000,4 Elements,The graphics have a really low resolution. It's not only 4:3 but also looks like 800x600 while the PS3 version has 1080p and looks much better!  This actually makes some parts of the game really annoying because it all lacks detail.  And why is there a stupid fps counter that I cannot disable?  Very unprofessional !  Edit: The game stopped working for quite some time and as I can see from the reviews many others have the same problem. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!
470030,Just Bones,"It's a neat idea bogged down by level design that doesn't do much clever with the idea. The closest the game gets to a challenge is in having slightly sloppy platforming, and in throwing lots of red herrings your way. Having legs makes your character too tall to fit through holes certain gaps, and sometimes legs will simply be put into a level as a red herring to screw you over for when you scroll over to the other side of the screen and find out that you shouldn't have picked them up, and now you softlocked the level and have to restart it. This seems to be the main crux of difficulty in Just Bones, and anything cool about the concept of being able to pick up and love bones to suit the situation in front of you, which was my main reason for playing it, doesn't feel well explored."

470060,1917 - The Alien Invasion DX,"Hmmmmmmmmm this game is a little puzzling!  Im a huge fan of shooters ( i hate the word shmup ) and ive played hundreds of them over the years. i was excited to try this game out but it just doesnt click with me. i have tried on several occassions to find my feeyt with it but i simply cannot.  The game looks nice and is well presented, its fast and fluid, although ship movements often feel slightly over throttled and then slightly sluggish when you need it most.  My biggest issue is with the fire strengths. the weaker shot is pathetic it pretty much does nothing. the stronger shot is not a whole lot better but all the while you are being constantly bombarded with enemy fire.  due to the weak shot strength you are often facing an enemy for too long and are easily drawn into others fire pattern equating in too many cheap deaths.  i want to love this game but its just not quite right for me.  i wouldnt say do not try it as you may likie it.  its .............ok"
470130,Eclipse --- Defending the motherland,I'll give it a thumb's up cuz its free. If I had to pay even a couple bucks I wouldn't rec it--gets boring quick and there are much better survival shooter games for VR. For me I didn't play it beyond 10 mins and then uninstalled.
470140,Funklift,  Quite an unusual but fun concept. Definately go and pick up a copy if you are looking for an unusual title.
470260,Event[0],"My only dissapontment with the game was how very short it was.  The game plays well, and the puzzles are good, but there isn't enough of them.  When I reached the end of the game...a point i am normally very happy to get to, instead of feeling any joy, My thoughts were 'seriously...that's it???' game play per dollar ratio isn't good enough to get a recommendation. Wait til its on sale. "

470440,Matris,"Very good chilled game, with fantastic music. If you need to relax after hard day, this game is perfect."
470450,Where's My Helmet?,.
470480,Angel Express [Tokkyu Tenshi],"The game is ltierally broken. Several reinstalls later, I can't even play the tutorial. Tried several online fixes, and just nothing. Maybe jsut my experience, but I do have a fairly beefy PC. I was enjoying some of the visuals, but having to restart my computer every time I want to fail to start the tutorial is a deal breaker for me."

470740,Demolish & Build 2017,"I like it and I complety made all throught. Is there any more update? thanks,"
470760,Antiflux,"Not bad! A bit short perhaps, but I felt it was good after the first levels. So yes, it starts off a bit clunky, but as you obtain more skills (game mechanics) it improves greatly.  Let's just say the price is fair."
47110,Escape from Paradise,Fun to play. You can do quests and get new items. Each quest unlocks something new.. Also you can play mini-games.  Some kind of survival game.
471160,Moonshot Galaxy™,"Only my third returned game so far out of about 15. The other 2 were Apollo 11 and Pool Nation. This game was just extremely boring. I believe all the excitement over this game was from months ago. It really does not stand up to most games on the Vive right now. You grab, you point to where you want it to go and then let go of the buttons. You point and grab and let go over and over again. It was not very involved at all. The physics are great though. But if you are looking for gameplay then look elsewhere."
471170,Romopolis,"This is a pretty nice puzzle/planning game, If you ever played the Build-A-Lot games, it's pretty much just like those, but set on Ancient Rome (as one would assume by the tittle), and it does the formula very well.  Even tho it is just like Build-a-lot, it is less polished than those games, blend graphics, no flashy animations, different backdrops or even a way to zoom in, what is really missed, but for it's price, it's excusable.  I would recomend this game, it's a good game for it's price, very challenging, specially if you try to go for 100%  "
47120,Escape from Paradise 2,"More of the first, but with better graphics and somewhat stronger story. The controls are the same, but everything is far clearer and easier to make sense, but just like the first one, it suffered with a lack of a fast forward button."
471260,Osozaki 遅咲き Late Blooming - First,"Made me shoot up my school, 10/10"
471270,Leave The Nest,"  Great game, was sad whent this was originally released for VR but now it's for normal desktop it's been great to play and see all the different zone types and birds, with a catchy sound track and great replay value its a Great game."
47130,Book of Legends,"A hidden object game with puzzles. Sadly it's so bad, even the over-the-top voice acting won't save it."
471330,Versus Squad,"Good game, just not at a good price; try to catch this one on sale at least 50% off and you wont be as disappointed."
471380,Urban Pirate,This game is the spiritual son of the Atari E.T. and Forklift Truck Simulator 2009. He has the graphism and the sound effect from his 80's mother and he's entertaining like his father...   Don't buy that ♥♥♥♥. Ask the dev to pay you for playing this crap...
471570,Grandpa's Table,Great puzzle game !  Pros : • A lot of levels ((24+6) * 5 = 150) • Clever puzzles - increasing difficulty • The art side with wood - inspiring nostagy • Great music  Cons : • The help system • No true ending  Definitely recommanded ! 9/10
471630,Rexodus: A VR Story Experience,"Yes, it is free but let me sum up your experince  Stand there and look at things, port to the next place, stand,look port, stand look port, standlookport, stnlooport... Done  5 min of uninteresting 'story' while you are looking around  Thats it. The controllers are useless and don't even show up on screen"
471640,.EXE,Fun and easy to pick up.
471660,Kingspray Graffiti,Amazing app and well worth the $14 so far but please introduce stencils/custom stencils. Even if it is just uploading transparent .pngs to create a masking layer.
471710,Rec Room, Early Access Review
471720,K Station,"  I finished the entire game not too long ago. It's not that long, but well worth it. I enjoyed the mechanics and the changing environment as the game progressed. The dialogue is interesting and pretty well written, often cheecky and a bit sarcastic. If you get a bit frustrated at the beginning, don't give up. There isn't a lot of instructions but the hint button is useful if you're getting a bit frustrated. I had to use it once or twice when I wasn't sure which character would 'start' the next puzzle. The puzzles themselves are long, but each one has a unique mechanic, eg: playing a non-conventional chess game.   The music! One of my favorite parts of the game. It really sets the atmosphere without being overpowering.  Overall, I'd recommend this game for those looking for a fun, text-based puzzle game."
471730,Rocket Ski Racing,"This is a fast game.  It pegs my 980Ti at 100%. Far Cry 4 on Ultra can do that, too. If I'm honest, Far Cry looks better.  More tracks would be nice.  Fun little toy. Best purchased on sale."
471770,"In Case of Emergency, Release Raptor",  Still better than No Man's Sky!!!
471920,Pan-Pan,"Was really sold on this game from the trailer &amp; screenshots. Unfortunately I requested a refund after 30 mins of wondering around aimlessly - not having a single clue what I'm supposed to do.   I'm sure the puzzles themselves probably aren't beyond my ability, but not giving you any indication of what the rules of the puzzles are, the means by which you solve them.. Its just poor game design.  Start with simple game mechanic introduction levels, or just spell it out with a tutorial for all I care.. But don't just give players absolutly no indication of what to do &amp; expect them to get it.   This review in the end isn't very fair given there's a whole game I haven't got to play - but I honestly couldn't put up with the lack of direction any longer. It left me infuritated after just 30 minutes which is saying something! "
4720,Condemned: Criminal Origins,"this was terrible... i've played seevral games of this nature and while they may not be my personal favorite type this game was specifically horrible... bad graphics, very clunky controls, horrid combat, and just slow... slow to the point of boring... they even attempted a few bad jump scares in the first level..."
472060,Ortus Regni,"Truly addictive. A purely enjoyable game. New comers might be dismayed at a perceived complexity which might turn them away from this game, as I was... I played a single minute of the tutorial and gave up due to how complex the game seemed. A year later I give it another go only to realize that I missed out on an entire year of amazing games that I could of been in. If you are a new player reading this, do not be dissuaded by how complex the game seems. It's really not. After less than a dozen games against the Computer you will, if you are attentive, know every nuance the game has to offer. This is not a trading or collecting card game. There are only a certain number of cards which every player has available to them at the start. Where the intricacy comes in is with how you build your deck. There's alot of different types of decks. I've seen some people who only build castles and put a multitude of vassals into them so they can then always win a political strife, and they rely on politcal strife to seize land and armies. I've seen decks built around mercenaries.   Anyway, this game is definitely worth a play. Give it atleast an hour of your life and if you're not amazed, drop it. You're probably not smart enough for the game anyway, if that's the case. And this is honest: You need to be smart for this game."
472680,Elisa: The Innkeeper - Prequel,"I understand this is a prequel, but the game is boring and does nothing to form a connection with any character. They're all one-note and stale. Unless you have read ever other visual novel game recommended on Reddit or the forums here, you shouldn't waste your time. Little reason shown to hope the final game will be better."
472690,SOMBRERO: Spaghetti Western Mayhem,"Tried this on Play for free weekend. Game is awful. First thing, in description it's written that it fully supports controller. Guess what, it does not! At least Steam Controller works buggy with this game, not sure about other controllers like Xbox 360 and so on. Color palletes used in this game made my eyes bleed. All in all, game has bad controls, awful art-style and no players. Don't waste your money."
472770,HELP: THE GAME,"  12 games for £10 (or whatever it is in your currency). A complete bargain! My current favourite is 10 Minute Tower, but I'm sure the others will come into their own at some point too."
472830,Ke-Tsu-No-Ana,"Looked good from the screenshots, a modern take on Zaxxon.. was I ever mistaken...."
472870,Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.3 Tatarigoroshi,"The game thumbnail thing tells you already that the third chapter is somehow about satoko (man I love her TwT). It's as thrilling and unsettling as always. The story begins cute and warm and fluffy but then it hits u in ur damn face and u get to read disturbing stuff, which u'll never forget. In my opinion ch.3 was the best one, bc the events were the most stirring ones in comparison to ch.1 and 2.  Plus, the details where a bit more balanced - less details on their everyday life, but more details on these strange ''incidents''. Especially Keichi, who was sometimes unlikeable for me in ch.1/2, got my liking in this chapter. I just liked every single step he made bc he didn't do anything dumb or disagreable.   In fact it's higurashi we're talking about - so why are u still waiting?"
473050,UnderWater Adventure,It's one of the worst gameplay i have ever tried! It's unplayable !
473140,BomberZone,   Early Access Review
473450,The Narrator is a DICK,I WHANT TO KILL MYSELF ALL BECUS OF THIS GAME!!!! 
473460,Memory Oblivion Box,I feel lonely here. I really only bought this game for the review. Top Kek
473470,Purgatory,"This game has a nice idea &amp; has promise, but it's very unfinished. I like the art style and music but both end up being very repetitive. There is only one battlefield where all fights take place. When there are lots of people on the battlefield, it becomes very confusing and hard to tell who's where. There's no strategy in this game at all. The skill tree is pretty useless. Even the upgrading of your army feels very lame. There is only one attack spell, and even that is useless (it takes off 30% of your health every time you use it and it hardly causes any damage). Enemies are very unchallenging. There are only about 5 monster types. There's only one boss in this game and I killed him about 1/3 into the game. The game has no finale. I feel like this is an opportunity for a good game but it was wasted."
473510,Gal-X-E,Fun time-passing game but the getting of new ships is too slow. To gain enough experience points takes too long but overall is a fun game. Can't change resolution either
473520,Autumn,"The game seemed fun... untill i found the slider puzzle.... heck NO! i dont plan on wasting my time with that.  Also, this game needs patience if you want to get stuff done... pretty straightforward... explore to the right and ... plant trees."
473540,Raise Your Own Clone,Absolutly great game for so cheap! Would recomend for anybody. 10/10
473560,Cosmic Dust & Rust,Game is fun until the final level. It is next to impossible to beat unless you have a specific configuration and play perfect.   A game that has so many different turret options should not have only one winning combination.
473770,BallisticNG, Early Access Review
473810,Killbot,I like the game however:  - You need to add English language to parts of it and any other languages that others may play this game in. - you get attacked by things that aren't even visble. - there is a slight delay while shooting or getting hit  with updates this game could be better.
473840,Diib's Dilemma,"Fun, original, cerebral and challenging game.  You play as a mage fighting against various groups of monsters at a time, crafting and choosing from a variety of spells.  The game plays in real time, but with the cooldowns the game emphasizes careful strategy over twitch reflexes.  Its very hard, the graphics weren't even good for there and it can get repetive, but its a lot of fun and incredible value for money"
473910,The Nest, Early Access Review
473970,Zombie City Defense 2,the game is a little buggy but its fun the zombies can over power your base if your not looking and I like that but I hate how you cant really leave the base because the zombies are a little too powerful alone even with a group 1 zombie can kill them all
474010,The NADI Project,"Really badly optimised, heave on the cpu. A lot of invisible walls and you are really only able to go into one direction. Not looking good for this game."
474030,The Abbey of Crime Extensum,"  I tired to play the game, but only get a slow long tedious intro - it does nothing else, there are no options to skip the intro, and when I got to the end, there was nothing more. Deleted  I am on a Win10 64bit Did install the latest version of java -"
474050,Candy Blast,"Addictive and simple! This is what a simple cheap game should be like, fun and addictive to a point. I have played it and it is just a time killer since its easy and fun at the same time."
47410,Stronghold Kingdoms,I Do Not Recommend this game to anyone Firefly takes your money and runs customer support is a joke here. they just recite a scripted line instead of looking into the matter. Save yourself time and money and run from these scam artist. Sad to see the game i love go down the tubes in such a manner steam says i have over 3k hours more like over 6k hours playing this game. So in good faith do not buy this game even on sale!!!
474210,BUTCHER,"This game is pointlessly hard. Enemies spawning randomly all around you, enemies running 10 times faster then you with chainsaws, enemies flying like crazy with chainsaws. There is way to much random crap getting on you. I started playing, got the feeling that game is pretty hard but playable hard. Until I hit level 1 from second part and I couldn't pass it. It is fairly long level and there just so many random ways to die. It just doesn't make sense."
474620,Giga Girl,"  Okay…where do I begin with this one? I guess we could start with the inspiration for this game. Giga Girl is an indie game that plays and looks a lot like Mega Man. No, wait. What I meant to say is this game is Mega Man. The protagonist is a gender-swapped Mega Man right down to the name. Robots are revolting and she must stop the obligatory villain causing it – the exact same premise as in Mega Man. Giga Girl itself is a retro-esque 2D platformer-shooter with end bosses that have powers that you will come to possess. Just like Mega Man. So why did I not enjoy this game like I have enjoyed the Mega Man series? Well, let’s get this review over with.  Audio  I’ll start with the best of the three categories. I like that the music strays from the usual retro-style treatment. Rather than taking the NES chiptune approach, the game instead sounds more like it’s coming from a Commodore 64 or a DOS computer. The soundtrack isn’t particularly memorable but it’s refreshing and has charm to it.  Graphics  As you may notice from these screenshots, the graphics aren’t exactly what can be considered up to snuff. Some of them look alright such as the tiles and bigger bosses. Other parts look either too plain or half-baked. Giga Girl herself looks way too uncanny with that oddly sized head of hers. Overall the art style simply feels like details are missing. It certainly doesn’t look like an actual NES game that’s for sure.  Gameplay  As expected from the get-go, the objective in Giga Girl is to traverse a platforming gauntlet to get to the end of the level and face an evil robotic menace. Any of the levels on the map can be played in any order. Of course, the baddies’ powers can come in handy in certain situations that could help make your life easier. There aren’t as many situational uses as there are in a Mega Man game but believe me, you will need every advantage you can get. There’s a good variety of enemies in each of the game’s levels and just about all of them can SCREW RIGHT THE CRAP OFF AND DIE IN A HOLE!!!  Giga Girl hits all of the wrong notes for a “challenging” oldschool-esque platformer. There’s annoying knockback, instant death spikes, and annoying knockback that can launch you straight into instant death spikes! Enemies can pop out of nowhere to land a cheap hit on you. Certain objects have a hitbox that’s a pixel or two wider than they actually are (Yes, including the death spikes) and then there are times where you’d simply have no choice but to get hit by an enemy even when you do see it coming!!! This game is unnecessarily relentless! Does it want to be played or not? There is no real learning curve, only the worst kind of trial and error awaits.  Then there are the scrappier mechanics in Giga Girl. The underwater sections. My God the underwater sections! There’s only a few of them in the entire game but they are agonizingly slow and give enemies greater chances to attack since you are unable to react quickly. The spinning mid-air platforms from Air Man’s sta-I mean the sky stage also deserve a dishonorable mention for being nothing but there for the sake of tedium and adding time to the level’s length. Unlike in Air Man’s stage in Mega Man 2, these platforms appear in more than one area.  Worst of all, Giga Girl doesn’t refill your life count whenever coming back from loading a save file or a Game Over. The power-up ammo I can maybe understand since health and item pickups aren’t too rare but freaking lives?! Is the developer sure six people playtested this and not one of them brought this to his attention?! The game’s already too unfair and frustrating to be fun. Whenever you beat a boss, however many lives you had then is how much you have if you continue the game from there. The only reason why I ever had five lives at one point was because I found a spot where there were two 1ups mistakenly placed instead of just one. I briefly used that abuse to my advantage. I don’t feel bad at all for using it too.  Verdict  Overall the actual Mega Man style wasn’t badly implemented in Giga Girl. In fact, there’s a chance this could have been a decent game. It has the potential to be a fine not-Mega Man if it had fair enough level designs and enemy placements. But guess what? Giga Girl is instead a brutally punishing witch with a capital B. There is no sense of real challenge to be had with this game. Everything is there as a constant disadvantage for the player. That’s not fun."
474750,Reigns,"Cool concept for a game. Basically you control a succession of reigning monarchs and make binary decisions which guide your kingdom. The decisions you make effect your kingdom in a number of ways improving or worsening the situation of 4 competing interests: the church, the people, the army and the treasury--if any get too strong or too weak you die, and are replaced by the next king.   Throughout the game there are multiple story lines which develop and a bigger conflict which pervades the whole succession of monarchs. It tells an interesting story and is just plain fun to play, and also makes you think about how difficult it would be to actually rule as a king.  Music and graphics work well with the game and provide a nice backdrop to the game. As you continue to play the game some aspects can get repetative, but it is also interesting to try to figure out all the different things you can do (including the inumerous ways to die).   I will mentiont that there was a glitch which would sometimes hang up the game for a second, but it didn't interefere too much, and never prevented me from playing after just a moment.   At $3 the price is very fair for this type of game, and if it is on sale I highly recommend. This game will probably keep you interested for about 3 hours or so, and if you are a completionist certainly much longer.   I give this game 8/10, and recommend it."
474810,Dorke and Ymp,"The visuals, music and controls in this game are all headache inducing.  Quick Look:         YouTube™ Video:  Dorke and Ymp (Indie Investigations)&nbsp;"

47500,Mishap: An Accidental Haunting,"A short Hidden Object game with nice in-game graphics and some decent mini games, that are finally not just match-3 and sport the difference games."
475050,bloxyz,"Just what I needed, another puzzle game for a Vive! One based on Tetris concepts as well. At a decent price too. Sounds great?  Problem is: there's no way to reset your seating position. Doing it in the SteamVR dashboard seems to have no effect. So unless I want to go and sit on the floor and face the direction the game wants me to, I'm stuck playing the game at some weird 45 degree angle.  Secondly, unless I'm missing something: there's no way to zoom in. Sure I could walk up to it and get closer, but this is advertised as a seated game. I should be able to do this without having to move my physical position. Right now I'm stuck staring at a fairly tiny play area. It should give me the option to use the majority of my FOV.  The gameplay is sound. It's simple and relaxing if you like this sort of thing. I could definitely see myself racking up lots of time playing if the interface weren't so awkward.  Right now I can't recommend it. Though it has only just been released. If these (in my opinion basic) features are added, I'd definitely recommend it."
475080,Cavernus,"This game is just trash. The controls are clunky, enemies are way to hard to kill and do too much damage, plus they are literally in every single platform in the cave. They are like cockaroaches their everywhere. Despite all this, the game could have been decent if it wasn't for those competely random annoying spears that are constantly flying around you 24/7. I do no recommend this game what so ever. If you are looking for a good roguelite game that takes place in a cave, just get splunky. It's fun and about 1,000x better than this."
475150,Titan Quest Anniversary Edition,  I had really good time playing it
47520,The Otherside,"A fun locate-the-objects puzzle game. If you enjoy FB games such as Gardens of Time, you will undoubtedly like The Otherside. The narrative is a little strange, but there are several different puzzle types to keep the gameplay interesting. The Otherside doesn't try to break the mold too much however and is a good choice for the casual gamer. The Otherside is definitely a great pick for anyone who has a penchant for puzzles."

475490,Major\Minor,"Don't let the furry charcters deter you. Major/Minor is a lovingly written visual novel that truly stands well above its competitors. The story is an engaging, dimension-hopping, heartfelt adventure; the music and character art is beautiful; and the choices (though few) are often difficult and have a visible impact. Give this a shot if your looking for a visual novel on steam that is actually good. As for me, I'm off to find the other endings."
475550,Beholder,"So far, fairly fun game. Difficulty is very high though, it might be frustrating. At first you don't know what you can get in to, so having to pay high sums all of a sudden is an unpleasant surprise. I guess it's meant to let you choose between things and to push you to take risks.  Sometimes you have to be quite fast. You can't take the time to work at a relaxing pace, because you will feel it in the longer run. The concept of the game is really good, the execution is okay. The art style is nice, although it would be interesting to have a realistic style.  It reminds me of Papers, Please. Obviously because of the setting (serving a totalitarian state, making some ethical choices).  PROS - Great concept, satisfactory execution - Writing dossiers and profiles gives you the feeling you're a sneaky informant - Family life, you have to keep your family happy - Nice art style (although I would prefer a more realistic style) - You probably can't do everything you want, choice of path is an important element  CONS - Difficulty, but I guess I just have to get used to it - Sometimes, the pace can make the game a clicking chore, taking the fun out of the game. I enjoy details, but I guess that inclination doesn't make me a good player.  Maybe a sandbox mode would be a nice idea? Less emphasis on money and family, more emphasis on doing your duty for the state. In the end, I hope more of these kind of games will come out. Beholder does a really good job in letting you feel like an informant/spy. In a way, it reminds me of 'The Lives of Others', a brilliant movie about a Stasi agent.'  EDIT: Changed from 'recommended' to 'not recommended'. Not because the game is bad, but because there is just too much that could improve. - It's unclear why/when stealing ends up in suddenly being caught. It doesn't make much sense imo. - Arrests take ages and could make you lose in a lame way. - It's possible to choose a lower difficulty. That is a GOOD thing. - The game needs to lose its rough edges. Having to choose a path is okay, but the game is too much trial-and-error.  I don't want to discourage the developer. I read some of the comments the developer wrote (at other reviews) and afaik the comments are decent and gentle. I don't regret buying the game, I just hope it will improve and that it will inspire him or other developers to make games like these.  8/10 tenants see potential"
475620,MOAI 4: Terra Incognita Collector’s Edition,"MOAI 4: Terra Incognita is already the fourth installment of the story of 'our hero' and just like the previous games it is captivating in its simplicity. For people who are into casual games this one is a real gem. The levels are bound together by the story of an island community which is tormented by a big wave, after which a new group of islands appears. For those who have played the other MOAI games there are some characters you will recognize and a few references to the other games, but it is an all new story. The short cutscenes and conversations allows the player to immerge in the story and to be taken from a ravaged beach, over an island full of birds, to an underwater city and further.  Aside from the storyline, the gameplay is much like the previous games. This means that you will have to think about the order in which you do things, but most of the time you will get there anyway. Although the levels do become harder when you progress. They changed the way you get your equipment; while playing you are gathering crafting supplies which you use to craft items to give you speed or production bonusses. This means that you can focus on the bonusses you like best.   The game also has a good Steam integration, which includes achievements, trading cards and a background and emoticon. Especially the achievements will keep you busy for a while if you are a perfectionist ;)  In short, I would highly recommend this game. The levels are well balanced (although they could be a bit harder sometimes) and strung together by a nice storyline. When I play this game time flies."

47570,Mishap 2: An Intentional Haunting,"Quirky, pretty and fun. As usual, I wish was a little bit longer gameplay but I would still have purchased it if I could do it again. Love the story with gameplay. Easy to play more than once and likeable enough to do so."

4760,Rome: Total War,This is absolutely ridiculous. I am almost considering never buying a game from Steam again. I purchased a new graphics accelerator for the purpose of actually being able to play this game and what do I get? A blank screen. I know I have all the correct drivers installed. I know I have the proper graphics card. I know I have more than enough RAM and processing power. I want my money back!

476240,KNIGHTS,"puzzle king here and this wasnt a great experience  good value but i'm not a fan of the main mechanic. u can argue it's about thinking laterally or whatever but when im 5 hours in and i get a solution but the puzzle mechanic impairs me from actually doing it. lots of trial and error and flowchart solutions become almost non-existant once you get to the later levels where you only have 2-3 squares of breathing room.  i get a little nauseous playing the game, and i think it's a combination of the clunky piece movement, old aesthetic and non-minimal minimal music (it evolves too fast for me and i would have preferred something static)  took 7 hours to get 100% but i could have fallen asleep while playing this so grain of salt"
476370,MAGATAMA Earrings,"Here is the ticket I sent along with my refund request when asked why I was requesting a refund:  The camera stutters every time you touch a wall as it jerks your character back and that is making me feel nauseous.  There is no options menu. The sound balance is awful; On the one side the BGM is only moderately too loud at my PC's default setting of 12% volume but talking to people and opening chests have sfx that are so loud it almost hurt my ears.  There is no quit option. Use the task manager or alt+f4 to close the game There is no window/fullscreen option you must the default shortcut (alt+enter) to resize the window.  The game doesn't support resolutions above 1600x900 (1080p)  The menus have incorrect control hints (Press X to close when you actually have to press B)  There is only one menu and no submenus for equips or items, you use left and right to cycle through equipment (presumably. The arrows indicate this but I never got any new gear to test it)  This game is not up to par for what I'd consider the minimum quality standard of games delivered on the steam platform. Thank you for offering refunds."
476410,One Small Fire At A Time,"This game ticked all the boxes for me. Interesting and developed setting, good characters, a gripping story and nice art. I loved the short chapters which made it easy to follow - a recent spell of depression has done a number on my concentration span, so the short chapters and clear-cut scenes were really nice.  There are lots of interesting ideas explored here, particularly about mental health. I'm always a little wary when I see something set in an asylum (as in countless horror games), but the creators had some really good observations about the nature of madness.  The setting was another plus. How magic would affect society was portrayed fairly realistically, at least to my mind, and I always love to see fantasy worlds where magic is used as another form of technology or science, rather than the standard swords, dragons and wizards set-up.  Although there is a clear 'true end', there are a number of alternates. I really enjoyed seeing how the choices affected the story, for better or worse. I like that the 'true end' is not necessarily the happiest end for all the characters...  On to characters, another plus. Although it's short, I felt the characters were well-formed. I actually liked the protagonist, so kudos is due there as likeable protagonists seem to be few and far between. I found Aidan Woolf a little lacking though, which kind of throws a spanner in the works since he's a major character...I suppose the fact that he just explains his backstory maybe made him a little flat for me. My only other complaint was the propensity for death-bed scenes - a pet hate of mine.  All in all, I really enjoyed this visual novel. Do give it a read, it's well-worth it."
476450,So Much Blood,"Alright, so imagine a twin-stick shooter. Only, it's single-stick, and you can only shoot left and right. Now imagine they threw away any semblence of game design and made levels out of random enemies, that usually don't have any attack pattern besides 'Walk in a direction'. Finally, make it that your shots do far more damage when they're near an enemy. to the point that you shouldn't even fight bosses at range.  In other words, I do not like this game."
476460,Picross Touch,"Picross (also known as Paint-By-Numbers and other names) is a classic puzzle type, that I've played A LOT of. That being said, the puzzles in Picross Touch have not been challenging at all, even on 'hard'. Still it has taken me almost 20 hours to finish them all due to the huge amount of puzzles. And I haven't even started trying the user created levels.  So, if you are new to the type of puzzles or plan to solve them while doing something else (e.g. listen to a podcast) I can wholeheartely recommend the game. Especially for the price of 'free'."
476490,Choice of the Pirate,"After Hollywood Visionary, this was kind of disappointing. I felt like my choices had no bearing, which is a shame given the nature of the game. Non-spoiler example:  'Will you fight this battle for us?' I choose 'No thanks.' (the next page) 'Oh, look, it's that thing they wanted you to fight coming right for us.'  This ♥♥♥♥ happened like four times."
476510,Cally's Trials,"At first, I heard a few negative things about Cally's Trials (aka, Cally's Caves 2), and I have to say, I don't see these negatives. Is it tough? Yes. Are there issues? Yes. But is it FUN? That's the big question. And I have to say, YES. You get weapons. You have a sword. You get to do a LOT of cool things, and it's a platformer, and it's great! Is the sequel better? Oh HEAVEN'S yes. But judging this game on its OWN merits, I have to give it a 7/10. I love the controller support, although some of the mappings don't feel quite natural. Even still, I have to rate this game pretty high because it's VERY fun! And the physics in the game are pretty clean!"
476530,Children of a Dead Earth,Made a 1.5mm railgun with 200+km range on capital ships. I call it the depressuriser.
476650,The Silver Case,"Incomprehensible garbage...   Is how most people will inevitably view this game, and I can't personally think of a single person I know that I could actually recommend this to, hell most people will probably give up before even finishing the first chapter to request a refund (I seriously thought about it), hence the thumb down.   Personally though I find this to be an uncommon work of art which compelled me from start to finish and only made me appreciate Suda51, the artist, even more."
476700,Island 359, Early Access Review
476710,MechaGore,What a heap of sh*t! Buggy as hell... Movement of character sucks... After restarting a level if you die youre lucky if the content of the level that you need to complete it appears.  Just a very very poorly executed game. Steer clear of this one. Looked promising from the screen shots...but hey.
476920,Amulet of Dreams,"This game was pretty bad, I would not recommend it.   The story was very weak, and near the end completely stopped making any sense. For a while I could understand where I was supposed to go and why, but then I had to resort to using the hint button just to know what room I was supposed to go to next, because no solutions made sense. Not very fun at all."
4770,Rome: Total War - Alexander,Short but sweet
477010,10 Minute Tower,  Reminds me a little of the old classic 'Head Over Heels'.
477130,Surge,Very funky sub-4 minute music experience in which you can't help but dance!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPiqaCK_5Xg 
477140,SparkDimension, Early Access Review
477160,Human: Fall Flat,"I don't always write reviews, but when I do the game deserves one.  A friend of mine and I just played throught the complete game in coop in one session because we were so hooked by the experience. We both had enormous fun and tried many things. Some on our own some together and thats the charm of this game. The freedom to find funny and sometimes crazy ways to the end of a level, that can be achieved alone or only together.   The controlls and the movement of Bob feels similar to 'Octodad: Dadliest Catch' and that is great because it is a bit chaotic and really fun to play in coop.  More maps and a Steam Workshop would be a great enhancement, since we completed the game in 6-7 hours and where somewhat sad after finished the last level.  All in all I totally recommend this game for one of the best coop-experiences I had in a long time."
477170,Chamber 19, Early Access Review
477200,Descent: Road to Legend,"This needs more stories and/or a workshop to make your own. It's still an awesome addition to Descent, but it feels abandoned at this point."
477270,Lightblade VR,Your dreams of being able to wield a lightsaber are fulfilled in this game. It's not Star Wars but it's close enough to satisfy my inner Jedi.
477290,Magma Tsunami,"Art style is a little out of whack, but is somewhat fun."
47730,Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening,idk whats the difference between this and the other 1
477310,Space Hole 2016,The name says it all.
477730,Eador. Imperium, Early Access Review
477750,Thirty Years' War,Poorly optimised as usual. Youre fighting the interface as much as you are the in game opposition. Standard fare standard grognard mess.  Okay on a rare humble deal. Barely.
477770,Ride 2,"Coming from a bikers perspective (lol like 98% of people that buy this are bikers) its a super fun game. 9/11 for sure.   something they could fix: - *cough* you guys missed the 09-12 ZX6R but got the 03-06 and the 07-08 like wtf? maybe that can be added in a free DLC - more drag racing would be awesome or maybe even full events of drag. add in full drag racing bikes (i know HD and kawi are strong in the racing dep for that) - where are the GSXR 750's at, you know anything that is around 4 year old LOL. would like to see maybe 08-10 GSXR 750 and maybe even the 11-now ones"
47780,Dead Space 2,"A deep story, and good gameplay elements. The whole series is worth purchasing in my opinion. Need something to get into story wise, try this series."
477800,Piñata,if you feel like you dont want to pay for anygames after geting the VR then this is a ok game i had fun for a bit but its eassy to do everything
477870,Yomawari: Night Alone,"This is a cute horror adventure game about a little girl looking for her dog and sister.   The good:  + I bought this game initially for the art style and graphics - I was not disappointed!  + Sound effects are spot on and gives it the perfect ambience. Music at the end wrapped it up nicely.  + Plot and characters are brilliant - definitely had me hoping for a good ending for them.  + Quicksaves/teleporting are probably the most convenient mechanics in the game. + Gameplay is somewhat challenging at some parts. + The tutorial ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   The bad:  - Too short. I expected more from a $20 game.  - Awkward design for the save feature. You can only save at the house, and you can only enter the house either through the menu or automatically be there at the end of each chapter. You can't enter it when you're literally standing right outside the door.  - 50 hours of gameplay to get one of the achievements... and this is a 5-10ish hour game. EXTREMELY excessive.  Overall this is a good game but it left a lot to be desired. It's still worth playing, but I HIGHLY recommend waiting until it's on sale prior to buying it."
47790,Medal of Honor(TM) Single Player,"I was put off this from the poor reviews.   It took me a few weeks to get through, although altogether the campaign took only 4 hours to complete (it took a few weeks as I was sidelined by other games and grown up responsibilities)   Nowhere near the gaming failure it is made out to be.   The game is perfectly competent first person shooter set in a realistic afghan war setting. You have access to a multitude of weapons and military equipment. The dialogue between the characters seems very realistic and authentic.   There are no over the top COD style explosive moments with outrageous plot twists, just the simple tale of western soldiers fighting a bitter conflict in an alien land where your main objective is to ensure the enemy is repelled and your friends are kept alive.   The graphics are a bit dated, the game design very linear and the the enemies are a faceless horde of al Qaeda fighters and afghans. The good guys are a more interesting bunch and are always communicating with each other with orders, directions and reports about enemy positions and current status.   I think the game received poorly as it was nothing ground breaking and a bit too underwhelming in the game design and graphics front.   A competent shooter, plenty of bullets and enemies. It is a little on the short side but buzzing with a sense of under appreciated realism"
477910,Wanderer of Teandria,   Early Access Review
477950,Simple Spy,"AWSOME! great game, but unforgiving difficulty. not a simple pick up and play game, but one you have to get used to. very fun, great animations and sweet music. And for $2?!?! its a good buy."
478000,Qantas VR,"It's alright - it involves downloading short 360 videos of Australia's best bits; which would be great if if wasn't for the following - resolution! It isn't great, and a little bit of nausea can set in when you keep turning around fast to see stuff - and when flying. Put it this way; if you easily suffer sea sickness think twice - if you don't fill your boots! I'll recommend it, as it made me think about holidaying in Australia after I've identified which bank I'm going to rob - I think Qantas have done an advertising job on me."
478010,ABC Coloring Town,"This game is a total waste of money, the game description states:-  'fun way to learn Basic English pronunciation and words.'  I fail to see how this game will teach a child pronunciation!"
47810,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,I baught Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition and it did not give me the dlcs like it said it would so i ended up only having the game which i think is a complete rip off
478210,BUDDY,"Eh, I like the art style and the concept, plus I'm getting intense Fran Bow/Broken Age/Bulb Boy vibes, It's just really clitchy. And the conroles are bad, WASD, exept W and SPACE don't work so you have to use the arrow keys. And the checkpoints could be better.   As I said, I REALLY like the concept and it has potential to be a great game, just not at the moment. :/"
47870,Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,"That game is pretty far from being perfect or good for that matter.  in direct comparison to my personal favourite nfsmw, which is objectively not the best either, this one pales in most aspects. cars feel more like trains than actual cars and steering is very minimal, yet drifting is way too easy to execute.  cars themselves all feel the same, pretty much sound the same and drift the same. the latter being the biggest difference.  technically the game is still very pleasing, but come with some drawbacks: the lighting effects are mostly hindering, especially when playing as a cop at night. further it comes with some annoying loading times when starting the game and in between races and the map. also the game is stuffed with stuff i'd simply like to skip. just restarting a race takes up to 20 seconds, as the whole map apparently has to be loaded again and the cinematics are played EVERY TIME. and even tough they are skippable, the player is forced to look at them anyways for some time. at the completion of an event, the player will most likely be rewarded with rankups, new/ improved powerups and new cars. all of those have rather lengthy cinematics and cant be skipped. furhter they deny the ability to restart the event directly and you are thrown to the map after they are done. the game seems to be stretched like cocaine for that matter. and the menues abandoned mouse support. further the options are very limited: no camera perspective change, no manual shifting and you drive the same tracks over and over.  but the game works rather reliably and the races themselves can be fun (even tough most the times they are rather annoying) and the powerups are a fun addition. still, for a price of currently 15 bucks it is not worth it."
47890,The Sims(TM) 3,Play a game of chess for one hour to become a surgeon!
478950,V ARRR,I tried to get into this but everything is so tedious in this game. Having the hold down a button to select is not a good UX.   I was excited for the sea battles but turns out you just shoot a couple guys on a boat and thats it. I really wanted to get into this game but sadly I can't recommend it at this point. Maybe if there is a big gameplay/content update I will try again  
478960,Clickteam Fusion 2.5 Free Edition,"Yes, let's launch Internet Explorer then lock down all editing. We can't let this show more possibility than a newbie at Klik &amp; Play.  Terrible crippleware demo. Not even suitable enough to produce a glorious trainwreck"
478980,Mansions of Madness,"This companion app works fine so far and makes for an exciting, immersive and all in all really fun board game experience.   Finally I'm relieved from my keeper duty and can join in as an investigator! No matter how much I enjoyed 1st edition, 2nd with it's app blows it out of the water with a streamlined approach, no long set up phase before you can start playing and by generally making everything easier, cleaner and in turn more fun to play.  And I'm really happy this Steam version exists, because I absolutely prefer it to the mobile ones."
479000,IrreVRsible, Early Access Review
479010,Kodon, Early Access Review
479040,Metamorphic,"I cant belive i have been fooled for the most STUPID and WORST game ever. 12€? The concept is good, it is logic but the game is itself boring. You are in rooms. Look - Quantum Conundrum has at least some kind kf envrimoment, like in a house, but this is about rooms."
479100,Music Wars Empire,Love it!!
479110,Hunter's Legacy,I have recovered my childhood... hard and beautiful game
479130,ESEA,"If you want to get better at counter strike then I'd get it. But, you have to put effort into this don't go in with a mindset to mess around go with a mindset to improve since 1 you pay for it and 2 this is as close to professional as you can get"
479150,BoX -containment-,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
479170,Drunk Wizards,"0 Servers, 0 Players, why even bother?  The game starts you off in a menu which as far as I can tell you can't quit without alt tabbing and exiting that way. There is not bots mode. On the server I ran there was a max of 3 players, It has only map and the map is tiny, Fov is to small makeing it hard to see. I don't remember if I got it as a gift or not. Not worth it."
479180,Space Universe, Early Access Review
47920,Shift 2 Unleashed,"i played nfs shift on the ps3 and it was by far one of the best racing games i played. this is completely unplayable on the pc. i tried with the keyboard and a steering wheel, played around with the sensitivities assists and controls and nothing makes the game physics playable. my last resort is to hook up a ps3 controler and see if that works. the annoying thing is i realised i had a pirated copy of this game already on the computer...."
479990,Dungeons & Darkness,"This is not the prettiest game you'll find on Steam. It's not the fastest or most fluid. The translation is a little off in places (for example, the 'yes' and 'no' buttons in the store are in kanji). Even so, I still cannot recommend this game enough. Maybe it's because King's Field held a place in my heart during the PSX era, I dunno, but this game really feels a lot like it, and as far as I'm concerned that's high praise. In short, if you enjoy medieval dungeon crawls, if you like collecting loot, if you just enjoy smacking goblins in the face with a sword from a first person view, you will enjoy this game."
4800,Heroes of Annihilated Empires,Multiplayer was broken. Don't buy.
48000,LIMBO, Winner of 'Best Silent Film to Video Game Adaptation' award
480430,Hide and Shriek,"p good game, gave me the doose pimples, needs more players and all that jazz, maybe another map wouldnt hurt either, you know little things."
480480,Slash or Die,"  Nice game with simple gameplay, helps you to kill some time."
480900,Slap Village - Reality Slap,"I thoroughly enjoyed this 3rd person point-and-click game.  I see only two things that could have been better: 1) The running around in Slap Village was sometimes a little boring - just to figure out what has changed and where (character woken up, gift arrived etc.) 2) I had a lot of Spanish subtitles in my English language game - this should be fixed.  Otherwise a very nice and polished game that kept my interest throughout. Also the few 'action' parts of the game were solvable for players who are not experienced with such types of games."
48110,Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic,"Developer was after a quick buck when they released this game. It has major game stopping bugs. I wouldn't play this game if it was free. Silent Hunter 3 is a decent game, this one is not.   0/10 I wouldn't waste my money or yours, again."
481110,The Bunker,"There is limited control over gameplay, but there are some (about five points) where the player can decide what to do, mainly during the flashbacks. The atmosphere is awesome, which is made by the underlying music - just fantastic tracks, and by the graphics and the gloomy and eerie setting. I can recommend this game for players who wnat to experience an intense story with the length of a slightly longer movie.  It is in a sense a movie in which the player can make some decisions to progress the story.  However, since the game is quite short, I would wait for a sale."
481180,System Crash,"Was expecting Netrunner or Chaos Wars, got minor variation magic clone.  Story? Cool Cybery art? Cool Card game play? Meh.  Not bad, just not good or innovative, could have drawn from much more interesting games."
481190,Stable Orbit, Early Access Review
481420,Final Approach: Pilot Edition,"Got Pilot Edition free as part of a package. The Final Approach game is really fun, but the Pilot Edition made me really sick. I haven't played it since."
48150,Voodoo Dice,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

48190,Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,Yo breh this so go hard in the mu ♥♥♥♥in paint ♥♥♥♥♥ its the best of the Assassin's Creed games i played so far ♥♥♥♥♥ you should buy this mutha ♥♥♥♥in cause you can be that ♥♥♥♥♥ Ezio Auditore and he likes to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es in the ♥♥♥♥♥ dat ♥♥♥♥♥ Ezio has come a long way since 2 got him a fresh goatee and all that ♥♥♥♥ breh but my biggest draw back on this game is the ♥♥♥♥in ending credits breh you can't skip that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and they take like 20 ♥♥♥♥in minutes nam sayin sayin breh im like i don't give a ♥♥♥♥ who made the game let me skip this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but they ain't let u imma have to go to ubisoft studies and whoop some ♥♥♥ for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t breh.
481950,Emily: Displaced,If you haven't bought the Help Bundle then please do.
48220,Might & Magic: Heroes VI,"I just stopped playing this game because the game has been repeatedly crashing when the AI town portals to one of its towns. I would have to restart the mission at this point and hope that it doesn't happen again. At this point, I think I'm done. I've experienced crashes when trying to play this game at other times, as well.   The fact that the game crashes and has to be reset in order to avoid crash scenarios is enough to give it a negative review regardless of what other features it may have."
482330,Legends of the Universe - StarCore,"If you're looking for something like Shovel Knight but in a Metroidvania, keep looking. This one has some cool ideas but it's so unpolished that it's really hard to lose yourself in.   If you've played Axiom verge 10x and have played every Castlevania game on DS emulator, and also played Super Metroid and Demon's Crest on SNES, then maybe give this a shot if you're really bored."
482390,The Night Cafe,This is a rather short VR expierence. Even though I enjoyed it alot. I do believe it could have been even better with some comments the ability to interact with the painting/environment.
48240,Anno 2070,I see the mixed rating and fell a bit sad. This game brought me into RTS genre. The game is a futuristic building game For window 7. Dont get this game for windows 8 and up unless if your going to put the time to make everything run smothy. Also if your looking for a combat then dont get this game. The combat is spam units and the only reason you do it is to get an island you need to level up you people. The good is that it is a game if your hooked you cant stop playing. If you are going to gt this game get it on a disk so you dont have to deal with u-play.
482450,Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel,"Bought and refunded. Wait for a deep sale on this one, unless you REALLY need a new waifu-basher. There are better anime fighters/airdashers out there.   + Great cast. Some of the characters feel really good and wholesome. + I guess the character animations are ok-ish. + It has more content than SF5 at launch?  - Poor backgrounds - Experienced slowdowns and framedrops on 1080 - Stiff movement controls - Gimmicky way to expand the cast through non-playable assist characters - Day One DLC (though free for now, will Heart and Homura be locked away later on?) - No tutorial whatsoever. I think all fighters should have a tutorial.  The game feels like Melty Blood, but looks sleeker and has a more distinct cast of characters. The mechanics however seem to be lacking, the controls are way too stiff for an airdasher and the online lobbies were pretty much empty. Wait for GGXRD:Revelator, unless you really need another anime fighter in your library. Not worth 27€, no matter how you look at it."
482890,Fantasy Kingdom Simulator,"Fantasy Kingdom Simulator is an excellent, enjoyable experience that never outstays its welcome. I had immense fun playing the game, and I think most people will as well. The game has a good amount of replayability, customisation, and even leaderboards to compare scores. I look forward to further updates and fixes for the game!"
482920,Hero Zero,not fun no don't waste free forty free its not fun
482990,Heirs And Graces,"I bought this game looking for something to fill the void that Loren The Amazon Princess had left in me. The writing is satisfying, curt, and clear. It keeps an excellent pace, and I found myself smiling during the interactions between each character again and again. Like seriously! The writing of the characters are great! Theres not a lot of cgs in this one though, so if youre a cg hunter, this wont be as strong of a game for you. But if you can overlook that, the writing will definitely win you over.   Great game!! Thanks Winter Wolves :D"
483420,Adam Wolfe,Very fun if very short hidden object game. Story was just so so.
483680,PolyDome, Early Access Review
483820,Four Realms,"This game is not for everyone, the gameplay is much more about strategy than action you have very limited ability to fight maneuver and cast spells so you have to like tactical gameplay to enjoy it, and there is a problem where suddenly everything you do causes lag and has to restart so I recommend trying the demo if you're on the fence about it."
483850,Guns N' Boxes,   Early Access Review
483950,SMILE GAME BUILDER,"A decent game making engine with very few resources, and not enough customizeable options as RPG Maker. Definitely not worth $80. Wait for a sale. $60 is a much better price point."
483960,Purino Party,"The match game is not fun. The routes are short with 4 rounds of match game each. It isn't 'hard' per se so much as it is simply unfair. You are in a situation where the only way to clear the match puzzles is to trigger large combos, meaning that you need to stay near the bottom of the board and hope for fortunate drops, but all you get are turn-stealing whammy tiles falling and losing two or three turns per move.  I like front wing, but I hate this game."
483970,Directionless,"I am still not desensitized to VR horror. For a while, I could never get through the first section of the game because the idea of being alone in a small cabin with big windows in the woods at night was creepy enough. (Especially after watching the movie Hush...) But once I forced my way through that opening part of this minigame (or mostly non-interactive VR short), it really lost its horror edge and became just a bunch of weird colors and shapes and unnecessary changes in perspective. A pointless gimmick and waste of time."
483980,Mad Father,I played mad father long time ago before it was even released on steam. Loved it even tho i am not a horror game fan this game was acutally a horror game i can play without scared to death like *ahem* (FNAF 4 did....).  When heard was coming to steam i instant put on wishlist and its alot new details in the game which i actually like. Graphics much better. Loved game before. Steam version still love it and its a horror game i will forever remember :D  10/10 - Love it
484870,Battle Dome, Early Access Review
484890,Crazy Otto,"It's ♥♥♥♥ing awful.  Don't even think about buying this as a joke, it is fundamentally broken.  10/10 would recommend."
484930,Beekyr Reloaded, Early Access Review
484950,EvilMaze,THATS MY GAME :)
4850,Cossacks: Back to War,"Yes, still good!"
485000,Cthulhu Realms,This game is fun for couple days. then the ai's are eather stupid easy or they do double damage to to you and are impossible unless you get constant perfect draws. I payed for it and really tried to like but I promise you...it does get stupid after 2 or three days.
485040,Nurse Love Addiction,"Good art and interesting Yuri action. (Not fully nude if you're wondering) Cute yuri action. 8/10 The Story is interesting, especially Nao's route.  Glad I bought it."
485080,Megapolis,"The game is fairly simple. You build in a small space with a few building plots. Some plots cannot be removed or are reserved for specific buildings in campaign mode.  The campaign mode feels really slow and it is sometimes hard to get both the trophy and the star in the same run due to the round ending as soon as you complete the objective.  Essentially, it ends up with you repeating the same thing over and over. Make buildings for money, then complete the objective.  Do note that there are some minor issues. For example, if you are near the end time for the star, the mission may or may not give you the star. In one instance, I went over by a second because of my own mistake, but the game gave me the star anyways. In another instance, I finished before the timer ended, but because of the completion fireworks, it went past the time. I did not get a star that time. Both cases, I was aiming for trophy and star in the same run.  There is also the great popup system when you manage to gain an achievement, which is fairly obtrusive when you consider in that steam shows you the popup already. I found the popup system to cause me to make more mistakes as the popup is in your face obtrusive rather than a side note. This makes maps where trophy+star is tight on time as it is even worse. Especially if you get multiple achievements in one run.  That said, do I recommend it? No. Is it an entirely bad game? No, but don't expect to build actual cities and expect a very long tutorial."

485120,Frog Climbers,"Boring to play alone, but blast with some friends by your side.  Played with xbox 360, china xbox 360, logitech controllers, all works great.  downside, max 3 rounds per day, until it's enough for me, but come back after some time, and do all again."
485160,Black Hole Hazard,"First off, Black Hole Hazard is a challenging game: it's a lot about timing. You are going to die. Many times. I found it to be a little frustrating, but the game itself is not so bad once you get used to it. The levels are different enough to keep gameplay interesting, the soundtrack is nice (except when you keep dying and the song keeps starting over), the story is average. There are different 'worlds' containing levels, so if you get stuck on a particular level you can move on to another one within that 'world'. Usually I just play it when I just have some time to kill. Recommend it on a sale."
485230,HALP!,"While the experience looks amazing. it was over in about 8 minutes. Not even worth the download size.  You basically pick this up... put it there, go to next part repeat for 8 minutes.  having said that though... HAVING SAID THAT.... id play a game like this that was an actual full game of at least 1-2 hour(s), and buy it.  but 8 minutes? the credits felt longer.  edit: if it gets higher then that. one of my kids might have played through it."
485240,Push For Emor,   Early Access Review
485260,Talent Not Included,"I received a copy of the game for free a few months ago as a gift from a friend. Each time that I've tried to play it, the game has refused to open. I've tried all of the usual fixes but I'm stuck at the mercy of the devs and I haven't gotten any responses. I even posted in the forum in hopes that there was someone out there to help but I haven't received any replies.   Overall, very disappointed. I wish I could rate this game with a thumbs up but so far, my experience hasn't been very good. I'm hoping that there will be a fix soon (any kind at this stage) so I can get to play the game, or at least see the opening screen."
485310,Head Shot,   Early Access Review
485330,Star Drifter,"Most of my 'playtime' is actually from idling to get the cards. All in all I spent maybe five minutes actually playing this atrocity.  Bad controls, confusing visuals, boring upgrade system and a weird resolution/aspect ratio all come together to form a game that is somehow less than the sum of its parts, if that makes sense. I am not the first to say these things, but I certainly wouldn't mind being the last one."
485340,The Orchard of Stray Sheep,"Well, I can't leave a posative reward cause you've sold me a faulty game that doesn't even load up the main menu so. Any chance of a refund?"

485360,Disgraced,"This looks like it might actually have potential to be a really good game. Unfortunately, the user interface totally ruins the experience. It looks like something out of the 1990s, complete with some of the same frustrating UI elements from that era. It might be good if you're actually looking for that kind of experience."

485390,Machine Made: Rebirth, Early Access Review
485440,Call Of The Mighty Warriors, Early Access Review
485450,Ninja Stealth,"Terrible. Just completely terrible.  First off nothing makes sense. This game doesn't even have anything to do with being a ninja. You are a hideously distorted Tinky Winky looking mass of ****.  So Tinky Winky's objective is to infiltrate 'Doctor von has too much money's' 'lair'. And steal a 'compound' (that has no further description on what or why) to save the world for further undisclosed reasons. So Tinky Winky puts down his tubby custard and gets to work. Now the ordinary part of the game is frustrating enough. You handle like a truck (well Tinky Winky is a fat **** so what can you expect?) and the hit markers for the detections are completely broken. Half the time blocking cameras with boxes doesn't work and you can never tell if it will or not due to the light still shining through the stupid things. The guards all seem to have single digit IQs as they don't seem the least bit disturbed that tons of boxes keep shifting positions around the room. Because that's obviously normal.  The sound is annoying at best, with one particular sound effect (and mechanic) being a complete rip off of Metal gear solid. And when I was doing the Halloween bonus levels, good GOD. I had to turn the sound off. It was so irritating I wanted to punch something. Oh and let's briefly talk aout the bonus levels and the halloween extras. Don't bother with them. The ramp up in difficulty is absurd. It IS doable, as I (somehow) did it without leaving a fist sized hole in my screen. But it's tedious and rage inducing.   !!!Minor spoiler below but who really gives a ****!!!  Yeah so when you successfully manage to navigate Tinky Winky through this ****show, you end up in front of some weird out of place computer looking system wheRE for some reason blindly molesting it not only gives you the compound (somehow) but also triggers the self destruct...somehow. So you get 15 seconds to walk about 2 metres into a sewer grate to escape. Now considering you came in initially through a sewer grate...WHY NOT GO UP THIS ONE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SKIP ALL THE BULL**** DETECTION ROOMS YOU STUPID TELLYTUBBY!?!?! So in the end Tinky Winky can either skip off merrily home or can be forcefully shoved towards the extra levels. Whilst you personally (whateveter your ending decision is) decide to slit your throat."
485490,Dungeon Journey,Insert positive review here
485560,POPixel,"Hello,  For start, I want talk about the good points of this game : first, the idea is great, second ...nothing. Now talk about the bad point: Retro bad graphics, maniability is like play as a grand ma, too repetitive I don't advice you to bought it"
485570,Milford Heaven - Luken's Chronicles,I Tough it said MILF-Lord ... havent been so disappointed in awhile :/
485590,Citadel,  Pros: Hard puzzles (may not be for everyone) Good controls Runs at 60fps/up  Cons: Says online but i didn't see anyone?? No tutorial (It should have one) No story as far as i can tell Not the best graphics Vey little character customization (you can only get new masks for what i can tell)  Overall i didn't really enjoy the game as i was mostly confused where to go and how to even solve the first puzzle -_- may just be me.  -My Quick look (First impressions):         YouTube™ Video:  Quick look! - Citadel&nbsp;
485600,OESE,"OESE is a simple game to pick up but gets harder and harder to walk away from. The retro styling looks really nice and the ambient tune is strangely relaxing. This game challenges you to survive as long as possible and I am determined to keep beating my previous record, that is what this game is about. Brilliant fun and would definitely recommend this game."
485620,Pick a Hero,"I bought the game for 99 cents and I didn't spend enough time with it to justify the purchase. I'm a lover of every card game, but the interface is just so agonizingly clunky I couldn't spend time with it."
485640,Genius Greedy Mouse,"Got surprised for the excellent quality, Superb and original Graphics and excellent puzzles, not difficult enough nor too easy and boring.  I`ve bought it in the last winter sale but would have paid the normal price.   Just buy it!!!! Nice game for older people and Cute for children!!!!"
485650,Campaign Clicker,"The game was amusing at first, cute graphics and the real quotes were nice. But it gets repetitive after a while, the dev doesn't add any new content and after about a week of play it stopped working. The best thing is that it is free, but I would pass on this, if you spent any real money on this then you are out a few bucks."
485660,Karma Miwa,The platformer controls are atrocious to the point of unplayability. Other QoL issues abound everywhere. This feels like a C- school project.
485690,Hope Lake,"Whilst this isnt a bad HOG, its faults make it fustrating to play. The game often mislables items you are looking for and mis-spells them, wrenches as keys for example and mold and mould. The game its self is nice to look at and is a good lenght but is let down by its puzzles.  There are much better HOG out there."
485760,Legend of Numbers,"Pros: Challenging match-3 game with elements of strategy which provided by 'pure' numbers. Complexity grow slowly from level to level and stops exactly when levels become hard enough to provide challenge. If you like to spend quite a time only to solve one level this game can provide it after some number of introduction levels.  Cons: Some timed levels can be too challenging because of very short time given. Game needs 30 or 60 fps lock, 'cause now it running at 500+ fps, which is not needed for this type of game and wasting sources for nothing.  Note: For now there are 111 levels total. After level 111 game says 'on construction'."
485800,Runeous: Part One,"Nice little VN, waiting for episode 2 and future work from them. Original story, interesting looking character designs too."
485820,e-River Cabin Journal,"This game is a 'good' game in so much that its concept is well put together and it is fun to a degree to play. However, I have some issues with it from a player's point of view. Not being computer savy and a bit of an older person it was difficult to navigate the game mechanics and figure out how to actually play effectively. The most frustrating part of this game are the constant darkness,the injuries and wild animal attacks that occur. In 'real' life those would of course happen but definately not at the rate which this game enjoins. Secondly, the 'time' factor for game play is set to a real life pace and this in and of itself is rather disturbing because I only have a very limited time to play having to work a 'real' life job, sleep and take care of my own personal business. Therefore after playing it for about 14 days....using up all my 'fast forwards', experiencing many injuries, wild animal attacks and basically running out of food and cash I am taking a extended break from this game. Not sure if I shall play it again in the future. I got my $10.00 worth of play and am happy with that. If the game mechanics stay the same and do not address the issues I have delineated above most likely I will not come back nor recommend this game to my many gaming friends. Thank you game developers for what you have done so far with this game. It was a stellar effort and I am sure writing the code was a challenge. Good luck to you in the future."

486140,9Grids VR,Nice graphic! It's a great game for when you want to just zone out and slash some ninjas. I'm looking forward to more updates and additional stages!
486150,Radical Spectrum: Volume 1,"This game is hard in a fun way. A lot more strategy to it than you'd think. Seems like there's not much to it though, needs some extra characters or something. Feels like a very decent time-waster."
486160,Berserk: The Cataclysm,"No control over battles, I gave it a chance for 22 minutes, then died of boredom"
486170,Bathory - The Bloody Countess,"This was my first Hidden Object Game (HOG), and i absolutely loved it! i was immediatly drawn to the gorgeous hand drawn graphics, and the style and story is very interesting/mysterious/eerie. Actually, what sold me into the game, was amongst other things, the second screenshot, the one with the Gothic knight armor/horse with knights hospitaller shield. Just looked amazing. And i'm not disappointed, turned out to be an enjoyable time.  It's a short game, it lasted me almost 4 hours, but i loved every moment of it, the music is good too, really sets the mood (mystery, eerie).  If there was Bathory 2, or a game similar to this , i would definitely buy it.   Highly Recommended."
486310,Meadow,"As opposed to other relaxation games, this one is legitimately relaxing. Worth the price of watered down Starbucks coffee, no doubt."
486350,Square Arena,This is no way to invite friends to play
486360,Timore Inferno,Annoying jumpscares.
486470,Derelict,"  If you like Survival Games, Aliens, Sci-Fi and lots of guns then this game is for you! Top Down game with a ton of aliens ready to gnaw your face off with every breath you take. Don't worry about starting the game and dying within the first minute, it's not officially part of the tutorial however you will soon find out that dying is a way of life. To live the best possible life you need to run, get big fat guns and blast every aliens face off that comes near you!  I've loved the game play throughout the entire development of the game, each time I start a new attempt to better my score I'm always discovering new features, new approaches to dealing with the trashy aliens and traveling to new systems allowing for even more aliens to try and stop me from bettering my score!  The game is addictive, one of those type of games you sit up late playing to get a good score, then die... then you say to yourself 'Just once more before bed, I was so close'.  Killing Aliens, smashing crates, Saving Humans... well sometimes, you can kill them too :)  10/10 from me, awesome game, recommend to anyone that love a good survival game to jump in and out of! No need to farm all day to make progress in this game, just get stuck in from the get go!  Have included this in my YouTube Channels Content :)  Developer is responsive to feature requests and bug fixes, enjoyed watching the development to release!  p.s. Buggers always jump scare me at least once per game! &gt;_&lt; But love it :D"

486650,Potato Thriller Steamed Potato Edition,"This game is bizarre and kinda funny, but it gets old pretty quick, and by quick, I mean after the third tme of doing exactly the same thing over and over. You walk around in circles wondering if anything will ever happen, and when something does happen, it's nearly unplayable. Buy this on Sale."
486780,Fruit Ninja VR,"Amazing workout game, I got soooooo sore when I first got it haha, stabbin them fruits is so tricky but satisfying hahah. A must have!"
486810,House of Snark 6-in-1 Bundle,"This is a wonderful bundle for anyone who likes to solve puzzles. The main type of puzzles are 'find the hidden objects' types, but all six games have other games for you to play. The first three games deal with traveling betweeen the regular and backwards (mirror) worlds while you chase after the legendary Snark. The last three games focus on the House of 1,000 Doors and the adventures that one Katherine Reed has with it. You need to play the last three games in order for them to make the most sense. In the first game, the main character learns about the House. In the second game, she saves the House and its inhabitants from fire. In the third game, Kat and the House save the world from destruction!  Overall, I enjoyed playing this bundle and I look forward to playing more games like these."
486850,Card of spirits,Spirit 19 is the best achievement ever on steam.
4870,Cossacks: Art of War,"This is an old time classic, it works on windows10 without any fixes or patches, on a laptop, great fps, old graphics but meh, can't have it all. I love playing as Russia and removing Kebab. There are also cheats when you feel the pc is cheating,  money = gives you resrouces supervizor=reveals map"

487030,Beasts Battle,"For a more complete review, see         YouTube™ Video:  Game Review - Beasts Battle&nbsp;"
487160,Trials of Azra,"The core mechanic is very unique but the puzzles aren’t as clean as say, Portal, about conveying what the player can and can’t do to a degree where sometimes you are forced to manually restart the stage. The music is not amazing but it’s decent, the problem is that it’s looped so much that it gets annoying fast (or perhaps the music is samey). A big positive is that the game gives you either something new to toy with or some new way to approach things almost every stage so the gameplay never feels old throughout a playthrough. I can't say the game is worth full price but if you can get it for at least 25% off then give it a go."
487180,The Lords of the Earth Flame,"A mobile game ported to PC via Steam. Audio on, or audio off. Music on, or music off. Played through 4 times, each time took about 3 minutes. The game seems to demand you memorise the exact route to extend the story as long as possible, and punishes you for doing anything else with an abrupt end to the game. Not worth your time or money."

487350,Pirate Pop Plus,"Game Score: 5/10  Pirate Pop Plus was pretty fun, but it's way out of it's element in modern gaming. You play as one of a few different characters with few differences in a quest to stop Bubble Pirate from blowing bubbles. (What a monster!) The game is simple. Pop bubbles with your trusty anchor in hopes of achieving a high score. There are a few different powerups that help along the way but more often then not you get stuck with on you don't want. I don't feel this game is anywhere close to a standalone game. It would've been better as a mini game in something bigger.  Pros: - Simple oldschool gameplay - Character selection - GUI customization  Cons: - Too simple to be worth it's price  If you like old arcadey style high score games, then give it a shot. I played enough to have only my name on the high score board."
487370,Akin,"   http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cleroth/recommended/487370/  Linked review almost covers all problems with the game. For such short game, where first half of levels are totally easy... and quote: '96 puzzles in Time-mode' unquote, are the same quote '96 puzzles on Normal-mode' unquote, but reversed by 180 degrees. Calm music... which is very annoying cause after alt-tab, it doesn't play in background... so it's interrupted and I don't like it.  The idea for the game is so simplistic, probably inspired by grid in notebook and someone not listening to teacher but drawing lines in his notepad... while it seems good idea, it's actually not... that much."
487430,KARAKARA,"It is a good visual novel and the romance is so perfect,but the 'sexual content' thing is skipped by steam its a pitty but i reccomend this game to a person who like romance things.But if u after the 'sexual content' just download it from  erogedownload.com "
487580,Ludo Supremo,No multiplayer over the internet. What a piece of ♥♥♥♥!! If a person wants to play on lan why not get the ♥♥♥♥nn board!! garbage game avoid.

487630,Lantern,"Nice idea, but didn't work for me.  Part of it was using the gamepad. I've seen the gamepad work fine in VR, in such games as IO Moon. But it didn't work for me here. Maybe rewrite the game for VIVE controls and teleporting?  This is the first VR game to give me VR sickness. I can see why they went for flying, but the speed is way too high. Particularly the turning. Adding some speed control options might be a help."

I was gonna write a reveiw on it but i had to play a least five minutes (worst waste of my life). If u want a game similar to this bt actually good, go with age of empires or even better get a life. If i had known about refunds earlier i wouldnt be writing this reveiw."
48800,Ship Simulator Extremes,"Ok, so this game is great, and its fun driving giant mammoth oil tankers into hurricanes and icebergs, but 1 thing: I purchased this game on a computer (of corse) and then that computer broke, so i got a new one, and then I logged into steam on the new computer, then re-downloaded this game, and then (like it did with the first computer) gave me a code to type when I got into and ran the game for the first time, so as I did the first time, I typed it in, but then it said INVALAID! So I typed it in again, same thing, and again, and again, INVALID every time! It worked on the first computer! I even waited a couple of days and tryied it again, INVALID! Im very mad, please find a way to fix this. ---EDIT--- Now it wont even work, it loads for a bit then crashes. Why?!?!"

488160,Galaxy Combat Wargames,"Hey gang, let me take a moment to tell you about this game I’ve been playing. The game is called Galaxy Combat Wargames which is developed and published by Fork Particle Games. Over the last few weeks I’ve been working on reviewing this game and of course a few things got in the way whether it be the work load or chatting with the team at Fork Particle Games providing feedback before I finished, but I finally have decided what I’d like to share in my experience.  First and foremost, this is an indie game guys and gals. So be sure to check out the game and like all games if you do happen to have questions about it be sure to send kind feedback to all indie developers so they can find a solution and help you get passed it. Now the reason I mention that is I was playing this game when it was in Greenlight, of course i found hiccups at times and when I took a moment to contact them, they were right on top of everything. Amazing group of developers by far!  On to the review:  To start with, when I launched the game for the first time at first glance it was cute, fun; and honestly I just loaded up and went right into button mashing. I did a few rounds back to back following their simple and clean tutorials and was just having a blast killing stuff; I was screaming “pew pew (rocketman!!)”; over excited lol. After a bit I noticed that the game was starting to glitch a bit so I passed the email and within minutes I had a reply. Probably an hour later I received my second reply to state that the issue was fixed and it was, keep in mind this was in the beginning stages before full release.  Much more playing down the road I was knocking out levels, I was simply in button mashing heaven with no hiccups; all was straight and I was enjoying Galaxy Combat Wargames. Between my first launch of the game and now, I’ve gotten a few achievements and fired a lot of rockets; it has certainly been a blast and I’m still playing it.  To break it down simple and sweet Galaxy Combat Wargames is a fun game, it’s clean and very user friendly. The interface is nicely done, the artwork is very cute; all in all I love it and highly recommend it. Grab Galaxy Combat Wargames on steam today, it is free to play. see full review at  woodbangersentertainment.com "
488210,JDM Tuner Racing,vtec yo self before you wreck yo self  Game sucks :\
488220,Valcarta: Rise of the Demon,"Let me preface this by saying that I have played my fair share of RPG's over the years. At first look Valcarta would appear to be another sword &amp; shield RPG churned out with RPG Maker's stock art &amp; sound clips. Look deeper and you will find a compelling storyline &amp; some custom sound effects.     Gameplay     Combat  I found that the Boss fights in Valcarta were challenging and forced me to think each encounter through and did not allow me to take the same plan into each fight. Each boss was unique, requiring me to formulate new strategies to achieve victory as opposed to using the same battle plan and button mashing until they were dead. This reminded me of battles from Final Fantasy in the past.    Puzzles  Another element of Valcarta's gameplay I quite enjoyed was the puzzles that were encountered along the way. Brought me back to the Zelda days of puzzle gameplay.     Storyline   I found the story to be compelling and elaborate, comparable to that of some other RPG franchises. It kept me wondering whether motives presented by key characters are actually true or simply ruses to enlist henchmen to assist the key characters to achieve their true motivations. On occasion the dialogue can be juvenile, but that can be attributed to the nature of certain feline characters. Felines will be felines. Information was consistently provided and I was not left wondering where I was headed next to progress the story. The story also provides the opportunity to discover some hidden gems and entertain you with comic relief.     Conclusion[/b]  So far I have completed one storyline option with 23hrs of gameplay. I am looking forward to taking on the second option and rounding out the storyline to see if my initial ideas of where things are headed are accurate.    "

488310,Eleven Table Tennis,Amazing. Great work guys!
488330,Highway to the Moon,"Highway to the Moon is an arcade scrolling shooter. Here you will feel yourself in a few years younger, and remember the days of our consoles. At the time, these games delights Player 8/16 bit consoles. I decided a little to recall those days and play. Everything is done in the old style, which is quite pleased me. The objective of the game is simple: get to the moon on the highway and catch a criminal known as the Moon Man. As always, we have to start the bike and weapons. And throughout the game we kill everything that moves on the highway. We have to start 5 lives, so forget about lose and happy play. Using the Phase Shifter, Jake can phase in and out of existence, becoming intangible and unaffected by physics. This allows him not only to fly over gaps in the road but also to pass through bullets unharmed. Using this ability in conjunction with a myriad of powerful and unique weapons, Jake might just get to the Moon Man first. -Use the Phase Shifter to dodge enemy attacks and cross gaps in the road.  -Lay down waves of destructive force with all sorts of varied and unique weaponry  -Fight complex and engaging Bosses  -Customize your gameplay experience using the Reality Alternator  -Unlock new weapons, characters, and more as you play!  By the way the most important thing for me is that the game is compatible with any computer . In order to play it , we do not have to have a super - computer. Ok. Now time to estimation and i think 6.5-7/10 is good to this game. I reccomend to all play this game and remember all good days what you was have at younger. "

I can't understand how this works, one time the character jump to backwards but sometimes no, and i don't know how i jump very high sometimes. This game is garbage certainly."
488590,Armed Against the Undead, Early Access Review
488660,Just Deserts,This game is terrible... this would have been good if it was released in the year 2000 on somewhere like Kongregate or Newgrounds... don't buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.
488770,Her Majesty's SPIFFING,Short and sweet.
488890,GentleMoon 2,The theme was just kids saying 'random' it was random not in any way a good experience to play though
488910,Astral Heroes,"Yep this game is good, even relaxing good .. That is what I from Card games Im waitting , and its free.. New game and new hopes , if you have been burned by other card games before like khe khem 'one big 3 milion project' then this is that what you need..  Talking about balance is to early ..   +Quests , Campaign , daily, and missions .. even steam achievments..  Good Game.  Update game has very serious balance problems .. some cards can destroy you in few moves... and Game keeps you from leveling up by versuing against bots with OP cards.. you will struggle at one point .."
488950,Werewolves Within,"So I've been looking at this game to be released for a couple months now, but like most of you I was shocked and turned away from the $30 price tag ($40 for someone of you on different points on the globe). After a couple beers I said F it and bought the game.   The game is amazingly fun. The art direction and the world it created is a fun and enjoyable atmosphere to be a part of. Everything is well polished and the game is simple enough for anyone to jump in and start playing.   Right away I was paired up with 6 other guys who I got to spend the next 3 - 4 hours with. It was such a BLAST try to deceive everyone or try and convince them of who you TRULY (or falsely) are or are not. Other than the game objective itself, it was so much fun interacting with one another, doing all sorts of gestures, making all sorts of jokes, and, overall, just being part of a new community and getting to know one another. It's an amazing social experience and I don't think I ever laughed so hard in a VR game (one guy said he was laughing so hard, tears were getting in his headset).    Despite being incredibly fun, is it worth the $30 ($40) price tag? Sadly I'd say no. While it is an awesome experience and a fresh game mechanic to the Vive database, because of it's high price I don't see many people getting on board and thus I believe the player base will soon decrease (which is common for online only games). Which is a shame, that the price of the game is going to be it's poison and greatest contributor to it's lack of success. While it is great being able to play with other players across Vive, PSVR, and Oculus, it's going to be impossible to maintain a steady player count unless price is addressed. I recommend giving the game a try when it's on sale. With the amount of polish and creativity I would say this is more of a $15 game.    TL;DR Amazingly fun polished game with great atmosphere and addictive gameplay, but with a hefty price tag that, unless decreased, will starve the player count."
488960,Star Vikings Forever,Thank you for this game.
4890,Cossacks II: Battle for Europe,One of the best games i ever played
48900,Saira,It's a very fun platformer where you collect items to get different endings. Simple and fun but short on content. Played it offline mostly so I have less hours than what I really have played it with.
489000,The Infinite Black,This is a point and click game. its really confusing and i cant figure out what to do. for the most part it is really boring and the onlything good about it is them music
489020,iGrow Game,  Brilliant game
489070,Edge of Twilight – Return To Glory,  Steampunk setting? Check Post-apocalyptic? Check Realm shifting (Soul Reaver-like)? Check Halfbreed sword-wielding protagonist? Check   who can transform into an ether vampire? Check A plan that can either save the world or completely destroy it? Check Playable on low-end hardware? Check  Of course it's got technical issues (it's just released from a team that has never released a game in Steam before) but it looks well worth the ride
489080,Spellforge,"dont like it infact hate it, if i could get my money back i would"
489170,Galaxy Reavers,"Game is broken for a month, after useless DLC update. Fleet managment is broken.  Carrier DLC is useless because you can buy only 1, same for titan,   Seems developer published all planned paid DLC and gone, lol."
489220,Unforgiving Trials: The Darkest Crusade,"I do enjoy the game or what I have played of it at the moment I think the game is similar to pixel heroes wich is also a fun game :D definitly worth getting this game, give it a try!   Accidently Reviewed"
489360,CASE: Animatronics,"I used to be able to play it, but now, it crashes every time I play it! Every time I start it up, it almost instantly crashes, and it doesn't even show me the main menu."
489440,Tentacult!,Actually really enjoyed playing this game. Sometimes the objective wasn't very clear or the location of the pentagram wasn't evident but otherwise an enjoyable game.
489460,The Last Leviathan, Early Access Review
489470,Hide and Secret Treasure of the Ages,"This is terrible Hidden object game. Creators made use of popularity of genre to make easy money.  Everything is wrong: - Stupid 'story' - Ugly comic - Random positioned hidden objects to search for, cut from some existing graphics - Lacking of good taste in every direction  This game is not worth even 50 cents"
48950,Greed Corp,"This was my first game on steam, and it is now among me and my friends the tradition that we play it co-op with christmas, man i'll never forget the ambiance this game has."
489520,Minion Masters, Early Access Review
489560,Astroflux,AstroFlux is a really fun game. I don't understand all the hate. A lot more people should play this game it is free after all.
489580,AWA,"I love those games that start you off with an awesome gun and you can just plow your way through the first section, of course as the intensity builds up those power ups will come in hand and don’t worry, there’s plenty of them in this game, pumping you up like a hamster on steroids.  Full Review Here:   http://igdsunshinemag.com/Mag/awa-full-review/   "
489600,The Golf Club VR, Early Access Review
489610,Chicken Assassin: Reloaded,"A great take on the clicker genre that is ultimately ruined by pointless racism. It's a shame that such artistic talent had to go that direction; it did a disservice to the game as a whole. The gameplay, music and detail are all fantastic but... why? -_-  If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, well, go for it... I didn't see any real humor in it.  In before 'too sensitive SJW lolz' you have your opinion I have mine."
489660,Fabric,One word for this game which i think I made up : brainsharpener. After few minutes of this game i start to talk to myself like a genius (not a mad man)
489700,Battle Forever,"  This is a nice first game. I rated it a no because it just gets boring to quick. The game at first felt like an ios game but games like these i do expect to see some type of work put into them, their is a survival mode to the game but that just gets boring   Pros  4 characters to pick from 13 stages survival mode Can shoot fireballz JUST LIKE DRAGON BALLZ   Cons Plain background Soundtrack gets old quick"
489720,Conga Master,It's either really difficult or really easy. It cost too much. Story mode is repetitive.
489730,Run The Gamut,  it's like super meat boy except it controls like total ♥♥♥ and has stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t events with no thought behind them and levels that are unfun
489740,Playthings: VR Music Vacation,got really lost in the game without any cues on what to do next..only managed one song..was really fun and enjoyable..however not sure if anyone got the patience to look around for a 2nd song..dev need to work on the game structure/guidances a little more..  Not sure if i shld recommend this esp if its only 1 song..i hope there is more..but i cant find any options for more levels..or maybe i am just dumb  Decided to refund this..coz the developers has cant be bother to update or even respond
489760,Demon Truck,"This game is really fun and addicting. Its had an amazing soundtrack. Its an endless 2D shooter style game and I can't stop playing. You should definitely give it a try, especially considering the price."
489810,BlockAid,"Cute game, possibly would've been more fitting as a mobile app, but still fun!"
489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"Just to clarify, this game is amazing; If your new to this game and your thinking of getting it, just do it.   If your returning to this game, be warned, as obvious as this may be, the MODS are NOT Steamworks and DO NOT support SKSE (yet) meaning there will be some time before any UI mods come out (as well as many other types of mods.) As silly as this sounds, the base Skyrim UI is just terrible and makes the game, for me, feel like a console game. SKYUI was and still is the perfect PC Skyrim UI, it made playing this on PC a dream. Again, thats my opionion, dont shoot me. (Also, i havent checked the Nexus yet ;) )  If you just want this because you do like Skyrim, then get it, as a base game, its still an absolute cracker! it looks and plays fantastic.  Oh, its worth mentioning i have everything cracked on ultra at 4K and i get solid 60fps. Once or twice it has dropped to around 49, but thats only during the intro when everythings going down, it really didnt make a difference, having sunk hours into the OG version, its just nice to see it run like butter. If that matters to anyone, take it or leave it. (GTX 980Ti, i7-4770k)  I also found it funny that the game looks realllllly nice, the graphical update is 100% better, but the player models still look like over cooked potatos. You'll know what i mean just by looking around in the starter cart. (Wow green trees! wow god rays! wow...um... sun tanned, slapped bum faced horse thief...)  PS: please pardon spelling mistakes, eventhough English is my native language, i am terrible at it.  8/10 only because of mods and player models. "
489890,Puzzles At Mystery Manor,"It does not lie. You'll be doing jigsaw puzzles and a lot of them. The display nice skull scenes and still retain a good amount of difficulty without being too hard. Overall, the game does not lie and for the cheap price it certainly isn't the worst thing to pick up if you like jigsaws.   My only complain actually comes from the 'story' as it were. You are sent in to solve the mystery of the dead wives and their trapped souls. An interesting concept but one that is completely fluff. There's nothing to that story beyond giving you the content of skull as the jigsaw theme. The story never expands from there and when you get done it'll leave you feeling want from the lack of a proper conclusion. There are a tossing of Edgar Allen Poe material around the game but that feels like a cop-out instead of present a true atmosphere towards the setting.  As stated, the game itself isn't bad and in fact is good considering price and what you are expecting to buy. I just feel they could have done so much more with the story itself. Especially when progress could've been given in the form of written notes or even the occassional voice-line from the dead women thanking you or the evil man threatening you."
489900,Bayla Bunny,I was thoroughly enjoying this game and then I got to the boat level and my dreams were smashed all over the floor because I could not achieve my dream of controlling a boat and collecting coins.
4900,Zen of Sudoku,Chillest game in my library
49000,Hotel Dash,"Might just be my computer, but the mouse cursor is very laggy and shows the path. Otherwise is you standard 'Dash' game."
490100,Quell Zen,"This latest instalment in the Quell series of logic puzzles is as satisfying and pleasurable as its predecessors.  As before you are challenged to devise a means of navigating a water droplet around the artfully designed areas, avoiding tricks and traps and defeating obstacles whilst collecting all the pearls as you go. Sometimes you just have to collect all the pearls, sometimes switch lights on, or enable a multiple grid of light beams that hits all available targets simultaneously, sometimes all of the above.  After the early tutorial levels the difficulty increases and then the fun begins. So many times you avoid all traps, devise a logical route and method to collect all pearls, solve all problems, achieve all goals and then you discover that you are just one move short of a perfect score, teasing you, if you are so inclined, to peruse every move you have made to try and find some way of shaving just one move off your solution. If your solution is, for instance, 53 moves and your perfect target is 52 moves, well, some time may pass as you try to find that elusive one move reduction.  Add to this the challenge of discovering all the hidden jewels in each level, sometimes they are quite hard to find as well as seemingly inaccessible, can you find a way of getting to them? There are levels hidden within levels, can you find and solve all of them?  Complete each section and, in a series of letters, a touching story unfolds. This together with the accompaniment of a relaxing soundtrack enables a pleasant immersion as you progress.  This is the sort of game that you might start to play on a rainy Sunday afternoon, the next thing you know it is the early hours of the morning and the birds are singing.  Excellent game, can't wait for the next one."
490160,Time Tenshi 2,"Game stuff: Basic Fap Novel, scifi story about time travel and a cheap trick about Time-effects to increase boob size. Entertaining for a few hours. Some voice acting would be nice. If you like nothing but boobs you should be happy.  The only negative strike on this game is how the devs handle policy. They don't tell you up front that they have a YT policy. If you plan to post videos on Youtube be sure to read their policy under dicussion. If not you might end up with a surprise message from Silver cow and your videos will flagged."
490170,Mind OVR Matter, Early Access Review
490300,Rabbit Island,"  Pretty short, uninspired, not that amazing graphics wise. If you like tower defense games,. get Gemcraft instead."

490490,Blasters of the Universe, Early Access Review
490820,Fly O'Clock,"Oddly addicting. Great game to kill time.   Tried searching/creating multiplayer games with no luck finding anyone. Local multiplayer is available, would not get hopes up with finding someone to play with online."
490860,DashBored,Undertale : RPG Maker Edition  BTW It's really good I played offline about 6 hours and liked it.
490870,Weird Hero, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVJWLXiJHcQ  First of all. This game costs $2.19 so i didn't expect much out of it. So i'll start with the controls. It is responsive but it's too complicated (for me). The game looks nice to be honest i enjoyed a little bit but as i continue to play other levels i felt like it's getting repetitive but i  don't find it as a flaw. If you're a casual gamer you'll probably enjoy playing this game with your friends setting high scores and such. Overall i kinda like the game. 7/10
490880,Robot Legions Reborn,"Just bought this game, it did its job to waste about 10-15min. Pretty much the only reason I grabbed it was because had some left-over wallet cash.. Pretty simple top-down wave shooter, nothing more than that though super bare-bones game, would not recommend paying for this game definetly not worth the money."
490890,Ne no Kami - The Two Princess Knights of Kyoto,"This game is a combination of yuri goodness and an action story, but lesbehonest most of us bought this for the yuri x,D And boy did they deliver. The main characters Len and Shinonome are friends, and they both have a lady interest. I really enjoyed the friendships the girls have + seeing how both the couples advance in their relationship. The game is very self aware and the narrative is a lot of fun with many hilarious lines. It´s not always a bed of roses tho, and we actually get to see Len having a bit of a tough time at first coming to terms with her own feelings. And I did not see the ending turning out like it did. (no spoilers here)  I ended up liking the action bits more than I imagined at first too. If someone needs a reference on how much content there is, it took me 10 hours to play it through, given that in the extra story from Shinonome´s point of view I skipped the parts that I had seen from another perspective already. So for a visual novel it´s long and the price is very affordable for the amount of content you get.  There isn´t a lot of actual cg´s with the couples but the few we got I really enjoyed. Given that when you do get the cg´s its actually a few different versions of it to give it somewhat of an animated event feeling. And one of the ShinonomeXRuka ones in particular is actually my all time favorite yuri cg on Steam as I am writing this. So thank you to the artist for that :,D &lt;3 all together its a solid yuri tittle and I would recommend it to any yuri fans such as myself~ :3 &lt;3"
490950,Frost,A fantastic Survival-Cardgame you can play in a short time. Its pretty challenging at the beginning and gets more and more interesting with every game you play because of the unlocks. The artwork and the design was my point of buying but i was also surprised by the gameplay mechanics. Play the demo and you pretty much get what you see.
490980,Daily Chthonicle: Editor's Edition,"Whew boy. Where to start.   The game looks very promising, with it's investigative paranormal esque vibe. But it falls flat on it's face when it comes to executing it in any playable way.  To begin with, the tutorial does a bad job of explaining what you're supposed to do in the game. And following it's advice to the letter, I still can't use the lab.  Next there's the missions. My first (and only) involved a police guy bribing witnesses who'd seen a serial killing ghost, to keep quiet. I had two options. Follow him, or just continue. Both these options do nothing to further the storyline.   Then there's the issue with game mechanics. Lockpicks pick locks right? And crow bars can jimmy tight things open? Wrong. Lockpicks do not work on locks, and crowbars are apparently just for tents. If you fail an action, you're injured, and you'll hear some of the most low quality voice acting ever. When one of my female investigators injured herself trying to pick a lock I heard the most boring 'Ow' ever, and I used to listen to peoples voice acting portfolios.  The game doesn't explain what to do with injured people. Do you need to give them aid? Or do they heal on their own? I never found out.   All in all, it's cheap for a reason. It's very barebones, and very poorly made to put it bluntly. But if it's given some much needed TLC, and the mechanics are reworked, and tutorial made more clear, I can see this becoming a really decent little gem."
490990,Aiball, Early Access Review
491000,Gravity Cat,I should be raging at this game but its to cute to get mad at.
491040,Bot Vice,This game was way to hard for me. It almost feels like they made it harder to increase play time. The controls handle adequately. Sound and music is a 'meh'. Nothing here to write home about.  I like the idea of a cover base bullet hellish game. The cover slowly gets destroyed so you can't take for too long. Also it seems like you need to beat all the levels under a certain time to beat the game. To me that just adds to my suspension they did things to extend game play to justify the price tag of $9.99.  Compared to the majority of ♥♥♥♥ out there on steam this is a good game. But I personally can't recommend it.  Here is a link to some game play if you're interested.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhjiATIfWh8  
491090,Ant Queen,I reall wish i could recomend this game but I can't. the story mode is a glorified tutorial of building a coloney and I got stuck on building the cacoon segment because of the spawn rate of catapillers just destroying my coloney.  the controls are too simplistic and designating tiles to dig is tieadous once you get a few supersolders its game over you win sand box
491130,Red Trigger,"This game reminds me alot of Portal. It probably was the original inspiration for this game.   Gameplay is pretty much simple, and somewhat similar to Portal, you get a gun and shoot the red blocks with it, when shot red blocks will change their position allowing you to pass through various obstacles as you are moving foward to the end of the game. I think there is some story in this game about you being in cyberspace and trying to escape, but there werent any cutscenes or explanation about it.  I toned down this review a little because this game was made by only one person, and its completly free.  Pros: - Nice animations - Puzzles arent difficult or complicated, but they are still interesting - Achievements  Neutral: - Minimalistic graphics might not appeal to everyone  Cons: - Short - Some red blocks are hard to see if they are behind glass walls - No settings for difficulty or controls "
491160,GemBreak,Very fun and addicting game!
491210,LUMBERMANCER,"Fun as Hell, bugged as ♥♥♥♥.   Seriously, it is a good game but it's so broken it hurts :(  I hope Roger fixes the bugs someday because they are so SO annoying.  The enemies don't stop spawning even when you've killed hundreds You can move when the game is paused No enemy limit, so if you don't kill them you are ♥♥♥♥ed  "
491220,Mr. Pumpkin Adventure,"Welcome to Mr Pumpkin a stylish point and click adventure game. Where clicking every inch of the screen will be the norm and clues to odd puzzles are hind behind a boring hint mini game. Sounds like fun!?... Me neither which is strange as point and click games are normally right up my street. Pro tip: Add outlines to objects you can interact with and update or remove that boring hint game, its not fun or challenging.    Really wanted to like this title :S"
491260,Take Thy Throne,No Player  72/100
491330,12 Labours of Hercules V: Kids of Hellas,"This is a great game to relax to, awesome for kids as well. Same for all of the games in the series."
491390,Alchemist Penguin,"This game is awesome! You get to play as a penguin, and fight dinosaurs! What are you doing reading this? You should but this game right now! It's litterly two bucks!"
491470,PRINCIPIA: Master of Science, Early Access Review
491510,Vanilla Bagel: The Roguelike,"I don't get it at all with this game. It is hardcoded for there to be a boss mob on level 1 of the 1st dungeon you enter. And it is 'randomly' placed. Which in my case meant it was the very first mob I met, 30 times in a row, within 3 or 4 steps of the entrance. And it killed me every time. I like rogue like games. I hate this one."
491520,Zero-G VR,"Don't get this if you have a Vive, you will be disappointed. Point your head around and pull the trigger to go that direction. Very nice visuals, but not very immersive or interesting. If you're looking for an artificial locomotion game played with a gamepad while seated, it might be alright. (Oculus?)"
491530,Notruf 112,"This game could be really good. However, there are loads of bugs. I mange to do one call and that was it. I had to come out of the game and start again. I've did different missions and they are really good, but the game is ready to be sold. If the fixed all the bugs this game could be amazing. But, at the moment it isnt the best."
491580,Mahjong Destiny,i dont find this fun
491650,Reset 1-1,"Its just awful. I cant get past the second boss and as you keep dying, the game gets slower and slower. what the hell. i dont know what to think about this game, but i know for sure that i dont like it. And for some reason i cant access my achievment progress from inside the game over the steam menu. Oh the cards for some reason arent shown either in my inventory, its showing up as an unloaded picture. Never had that happening in a game."
491720,Nary, https://youtu.be/8nIo2rMTkJA   Take the classic endless runner and add in a heavy dose of input challenges and the end result is Nary. A game that is a step above in the difficulty department. This mix of elements makes for a multi-focus gameplay with a lot of potential.  Yet that potential is weakened by poor UI flow and critically wounded by the game's tendency to miss player input leading to unfair aggravating deaths.
491790,Project Syria,"I was going to give this a bad review, based on VR experience alone. But apparenty basic human rights needs a Primer in the USA, so I'm going to give it a Thumbs up, since everyone should know this information. As the father of a 12 year old girl, I'm very sympathetic to the plight of refugee children.  Other information for the trolls that are sure to respond: 1) I am not voting for Clinton 2) If you object to me giving this a postive review for political reasons, please object to the overwhelming number of negative ones that are posted for the the opposite reason. 3) If your only objection to my review is political, I invite you to take your argument with me to my twitter account @goyoelburro This isn't really the place for an extended debate with me."
491830,Glow,"It might have been fun, but its ridiculously graphics heavy and really doesn't like my card, so..."
491950,Orwell,"Wow. Just wow. This is quite possibly the greatest game I have played in a long time. Orwell tells a brilliant narrative in an incredibly unique way, while also making an excellent point in regard to total surveillance (hence Orwell.) What is essentially a point-and-click game manages to create incredible suspense, much better than the likes of many free-roam games. Due to your choices affecting the outcome of the story, Orwell is worth more than one playthrough. I have just finished my first, and I will be starting my second playthrough immediately.    10/10, would strongly recommend giving this at least one playthrough, especially given the price, particularly if you enjoy strong narratives and unique gameplay."
4920,Natural Selection 2,no casuals allowed
492080,Vision of Aurora Borealis,  I found this difficult to masturbate to  
492170,Planet Driller,"  There are some cool things about this game, but honestly not anything different that you wouldn't find in any other mining 'sim'.   The cons vastly outweigh the pros though.  I really don't understand why the day and night cycle effects the underground or why there are shadows.  The physics that are applied to the ship are actually so much more annoying than they help 'immersion' or 'realism'  The menus look god awful. All the sliders are dragged all across the screen.  Nothing saves, no settings, no progress, nothing.    There are free broswer games that have more functionality than this game."

492340,Pixel Cup Soccer 17, Early Access Review
492370,Affairs of the Court: Choice of Romance,"Love this game, love playing it. One of the first Choice of Games products, and a really great Choose Your Own Adventure"
492400,Thunder Gun: Revenge of the Mutants,Lighting gun is a cool idea but this is a really basic game.   I was hoping for a throwback to something really inspiring and inventive like Contra or Turrican but this feels more like a Flash game.
492430,Alteric,Complicated but fun.
492490,Zombie Apocalypse: Escape The Undead City,"Very intensed game If you don't mind violent shooter games, you might like this game  Zombies and blood everywhere!"
492530,The Dark Legions,"Do yourself a favor and save your money for Age of Empires 2 or Warcraft 3. This game wants so bad to be Warcraft 3 it isn't funny. Well, it kind of is for a few minutes, but the bland colors and awful pathing and controls make this game just want you to play a better RTS. Don't let the 2$ price tag fool you, it isn't really worth it. The wonky animations and graphics work for Warcraft, but just make this game look ugly."
492600,Ridge,"This game is complete trash. If you want to waste your time and get honey dicked then buy this garbage game, if you can call it a game. I like to call it a waste of money. I now know why only one person worked on it. He killed himself after making the game."
492610,One Day : The Sun Disappeared,"Ugly and boring are what this game is, nothing insirational about your character, enemys, level design and bosses. Controls are slippery and annoying seems there is an input lag which is rather bothersome, so to call it out for what it really is, its a bad phone game port,"
492630,Bear With Me,"I love noir style games. I love stories that are a little trippy (salvador dali) 'ish'. What i dont like is a 'point and click' game that insults my intelligence almost every time I 'point and click'. I wanted to like this game. Sadly, i didnt. I'm not the kind of person that hangs out with an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, just to have a friend."
492710,VR Ping Pong,"Weak graphics and only a few weak/silent sounds. Only one very simple looking static arena without any special effects or anything new. The A.I. is constantly being unfair (and stupidly animated), the ball is dropping on the edges all the time. Physics isn't perfect, doesn't feel real. I can pump up super sampling to 3.0x but still feel the game doesn't look sharp enough. (I'm not sure if it's even affected)  There are much better VR table sims for the same money which even come with multiplayer, better avoid this one."
492800,Shonen Idle Z,it would be a help if u were told how to play what a load of rubbish
492840,Veterans Online,"Edit: Please take the following review with a grain of salt. Apparently the devs mistakenly put the game available on steam before it was in a presentable state, so it's understandable that the game wasn't functioning yet. Mistakes happen. I'll keep the review up nonetheless and change it accordingly to the game quality when it is released in a stable state.   -------------------------------------------------------------  You open the game and are greeted with a pretty bare bones menu screen, some options blacked out. Music is decent, although repetitive after a while. You press the 'quick mission' button to try to get into a match and try the game out, and after quite some time searching for one, the accept button pops up. To your dismay, it does nothing, and you're sent back to the menu screen into an infinite loop of searching and accepting the match. 'Huh, maybe it just takes some time', you think, and decide to open the options menu. You find that only 2 out of the 4 option tabs available have actual options to pick, and even those aren't very complex. Nothing out of the ordinary of course, but still after all this time, no match found. It's a new game though, so it's normal it doesn't have a big enough playerbase yet. You decide to try a custom game.  You can't seem to find any option to insert bots at first, and since you have absolutely no friends that want to play this with you (or to do anything really), you decide to go solo. You enter the game, and hey, the graphics actually look kinda cool. You try some of the usual controls, and next thing you know you're shooting. Shooting at nothing because you're the only thing on the map, but still shooting.  You explore the map and find an objective in the middle, pressing E to interact with it, and the game freezes. I alt-f4 and try open the game again, and now instead of the menu screen, you're welcomed to a 'coming soon' screen. You unistall and reinstall the game, but nope, still 'coming soon'.  Maybe in the 10 minutes you tried to get this to work the devs realized their game was in an incomplete state and probably wasn't steam ready. You unistall the game and while reaching for a cigarette to ease the experience, you realize you have ran out. Life is terrible."

492870,FIVE: Champions of Canaan,"An arena based action RPG very much in the style of Diablo. The depth of Champion of Canaan's weapon and ability systems is ultimately wasted on broken, repetitive and mindless combat.  Quick Look:  https://youtu.be/KTxIDnA0L64 "

493060,Ballistic Tanks,"There is a very, very annoying bug where sometimes when you're about to advance to the next level, the game just exits for you and you have to start all over again. Seriously? There is no worse feeling than getting so far and then not being able to continue because of a game bug. Please fix this."
493100,BellyBots, Early Access Review
493110,KOTH,"This is a faithful version of the original 8 bit classic I remember playing in glorious VGA decades ago. The graphics are simple but all that's needed.  A tutorial is included and frankly you need it because although the premise is simple (you have to move to a vantage point high enough to absorb the S̶e̶n̶...i mean Koth which revolves with a lighthouse beam), there's combinations such as holding the control pad and grip button to absorb a platform that aren't intuitive.  Other than that, this gets a big thumbs up and i'm looking forward to getting to higher levels, which as i remember were fiendishly difficult and quite frantic as you move around trying to evade that deadly gaze. At a higher price i'd say no as it's not going to wow anybody graphically but for sheer gameplay it's 9/10."
49320,Woody Two-Legs Attack of the Zombie Pirates,"You remember that part in Sid Meier's Pirates where you get in a boat and start ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up, and it was a lot of fun? This game tries to emulate that experience and makes it the worst gaming experience period. The controls are terrible, the game play is not fun, and you are stuck with the lamest boat possible. It's essentially a tower defense. You dfend your gold on some island, and you try to recover your resources, but it's almost impossible when YOUR RESOURCES SINK TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. You can also beat the game without beating the final boss, I'm pretty sure it's unintended, but who cares, any more time playing this game is better spent jerking off."
493290,World VR Competition,"World VR Competiton excels in it's simplicity and allows for anyone to pick up and play with hours of enjoyment on end for groups of people.  I played with 3 other friends and the ability for us to create our own character at the very beginning was a welcome addition to the experience and gave the title it's own uniqueness. I have yet to see another VR game do this.   As for the games, each one had it's own mechanic and it's own difficulty curve that made each one feel different, challenging, but yet rewarding all on it's own. Since each mini game has it's own unique/different objective it was very interesting to see one friend suck at one game, but be the master at another. This, in turn, created a fun competitive atmosphere in the room as we watched the medal count change after every game.  My personal favorite mini game was the trap shooting due to it's difficulty. One friend's favorite was the boxing as he came close to beating the wrold record. Another friend enjoyed the sniping as he had to account for travel time. This goes to show that there is something for everyone in this game.   That aside, this game is a perfect party game if you want to have friends over. Reminds me of the good 'ol Nintendo 64 days where people actually had to come over and play.   TL;DR Having multiple people come over for VR and play 15 minute games at a time is a drag. This allows everyone to quickly jump in and jump out and has a great competitive pace to it. Recommend."
49330,Pirates of Black Cove,"Grand Theft Pirate. You run missions for each faction and earn reputation with each faction as you do.

493310,Requiem: Avenging Angel,"Welcome to Steams WillMyGameWork lotto . com, released in 2000 and 16 years later its still a gamble on whether this title will boot up on your PC. According to some there are work arounds but me personally I don't want to encourage, publishers from digging up any old devs non-working corpse of a game. Requiem Avenging Angel makes Bethesda games look bug free. What gets my goat is the game itself isn't half-bad. It was just eaten up in the Half-life 1 hype."
493340,Planet Coaster,"If you're a player who regularly goes without Internet access, I cannot recommend this game. Personally I love the game WHEN I can play it, but this Denuvo DRM is really spoiling it for me. The devs have specified it only needs to connect to the internet the first time you run the game, though for me this has not been the case and it has bitten me in the ♥♥♥♥ multiple times.  I hate to write a negative review like this for an awesome game. However if I can't play it, it doesn't matter how awesome the game is."

493720,Haven Moon,"Beautiful and atmospheric game, stunning scenery but puzzles hopeless. Conventionally it should be possible to solve puzzles by collecting clues and applying logic. One should also know when the puzzle is solved and if the switch or whatever affects something a long way away, there should be an indicator as to what to do. Some of this could easily be fixed by the writer e.g. the bridges puzzle where one has to switch off a broken capacitor, there is no indication taht the capacitor is broken."
493770,Awakened,"Despite an interesting idea the game remains unfinished.  While I was able to overcome the quest of gathering oxygen, the second one with powering an engine is just unbearable with no real explanation of what to do and no engine as such.  The soundtrack is pretty good.  Can't recommend the game at the moment. Hopefully it will be fixed."
493780,Nightork Adventures - Beyond the Moons of Shadalee,"Hi People!!! A game personifies by itself a simple game, that reminds times of dendi and sega. You must save a planet on 30 keen levels where and will meet 6 bosses. A pleasant surprise for me caused, then what you will be able to do levels and it will not become boring, you if you passed all game suddenly. Also brings in the variety of color of our opponents of demons (red, green and blue ) and it can not be unnoticed. I do not advise to consider a game you easy, you it admits an error, if will not avoid opponents and will die simply. Simple and clear even to the simple man management. Clear aim and task : to clean out a cave There are achievements and collection cards in a game. I advise to play, in fact a game does not have limitations on age. I repeat, a game costs the money and will bring mass of pleasure to you. My estimation of game 6/10. Efforts of developers are fully justified."
493810,Jonah's Path,"It isn't listed as a VR game in my Library, starting VR then accessing via library eventually got me a view like sitting in a cinema but no clue on controls and not really VR. Accessing from Steam started the Vive but then nothing else happened. Never had a problem getting anything else to run so it's a fail from me."
493980,Green Ranch,"This is a bright and colorful causal time management game. The mechanics are easy enough to learn and the pace seems to be fairly easy, at least in the early levels. If you like games of this kind, then this one is unlikely to disapoint."
494000,Anthelion,"The game is polished and looks nice, but I don't think it's quite for me. It's super fast-paced and confusing, and I think the game would've been way better on a linear instead of circular pattern, because the motion made my head spin after only a few minutes playing it. If you want a challenge, then I reccomend this game to you, but if you want a casual game, and expecially if you get motion sick easily, I'd say keep looking."
494100,ENIGMA:,"Great story plot, fanscinating music! And I just can`t stop luving this Chester guy - more or less he reminded me of Kuroto from Hanakisou.

494230,Heart's Medicine - Time to Heal,"I liked Heart's Medicine Season 1 and I like this one quite a bit as well. I enjoy time management games and this one has a high production value. Its very pretty and though it was challenging, I never found it falling into hopelessly frustrating territory like so many time management games do.  But my favorite part? This game has a story. I am not even kidding. Its not just a bare framework but a real one, and its quite good. It definitely tugged at the heartstrings. I definitely recommend this game if you want something casual and fun to play while unwinding after a long day."
494290,MiDZone,"  So, my friend got this game for free from the dev for me (for whatever reason), and... well, I could talk about the fact that it looks and plays like it was just created in an hour, but I've got something different.  When I tried playing this the first time, I had to close the game shortly afterwards (IIRC, there was something wrong with it's launch). After this, I could not launch the game because it's .exe file was missing. Even after verifying the files several times, the .exe just kept mysteriously vanishing. After asking the dev why I couldn't get the .exe to stay, he suggested I re-install the game (which worked), and I had the wonderful pleasure of playing such a wonderfully broken game (note: I played before the patch was launched [but I can't because the .exe is missing again anyways], so it might be better in some slight way?). But this was back on July 11th, so why am I writing a review now? Because I found all of the .exe's today.  In the Avast Virus Chest .   It made my day, but I still wouldn't recommend the game."

Too bad this game is horrible, very unsatisfying. Very basic and generic sound effects and mediocre setting just make this game horrible.

494380,VR Boxing Workout,It's not that bad for what it is. I like the bag speed challenge. The strength challenge doesn't really work which makes sense as you aren't actually making contact with the dummy.   If Thrill of the Fight adds heavy bag and speed bag training this will be obsolete. Until then this is an ok option for a quick workout with a virtual heavy bag. Heck it was under 7 bucks I think it's worth that.

494450,Office lovers,"Ignore my time on record, I played this on mobile before it came to Steam. This game is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. The premise is actually a decent one, but how they handle the relationships between you and these men is just beyond off-putting. I've never played a Japanese dating sim that didn't have a very dubcon feel, I expect that from their story telling style. However, this crosses that territory in to just plain creepiness and it feels totally unintentional. This game fails to understand how it comes across to a Western audience in particular. I played this game on mobile first and live blogged the entire thing and..the one thing that kept coming up was 'are you sure this isn't secretly a horror game?'. It would have succeeded far more as a thriller. I'm sorry but when you have three erotic scenes in one particular route and you're not even on a first name basis with the love interest by the end of the game, how am I supposed to take that? This entire office is INSANE. They are all crazy about you as if this were a frat house and they'd never actually encountered a woman before. Not only that but the way they ALL insult you and treat you as if your worth as a woman is limited to their cosmetics..it's baffling. With lines line 'a goddess shouldn't ever have chapped lips, fix that' and 'for someone who works for a cosmetic company you sure don't care about your appearance it's disapointing' and 'I'm going to feed him like a pet, and train him to stay away from you.' [in reference to a really sweet new guy wanting to have lunch with you], 'Look at you using lip stick like a good girl!'. Everyone in this story is emotionally abusive and manipulative. I expect that from our tsundere and glasses types, but literally, EVERYONE is like that in this story (even if they aren't a love interest). This game is baffling. Not as baffling as Secrets of Me--a game by this same company I really hope comes to Steam because you have to play it to believe it--but darn close. Nothing in this game is romantic or sweet. The only reason you should invest any money into it is a morbid curiosity of how deep the rabbit hole goes and how utterly psychotic everyone is. If you change your perception of the game and view it as a psychological thriller or a dark comedy or even a satire of this genre, you may enjoy it more, but as a romance novel it's laughably awful, insulting, and just degrading. If it were more self aware, maybe, but it clearly isn't."
494460,Dangerous Relationship,definitley reccommend this game especially for the price I got it for in the steam sales. Kinda makes me feel guilty tbh .. Some translation fails but thats expected and honestly no where near as bad as othres ive played.
494470,My Butler,"Another poorly written, sub-par VN/otome from this developer. Only good thing about the VN is the art. Not worth the full price asked."
494740,Police Quest Collection,"Gamer's Discression is Advised.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEnibPvgfZo  A Collection of 4 Police Quest titles released from 1987-1993. It's Another great Inventory Adventure series that Sierra On-Line created back when MS-DOS &amp; Windows 3.1/95/98 was still by popular demand. The first three games were produced by former police officer Jim Walls and follow the adventures of Sonny Bonds, a character whose name and appearance was loosely based off his own son, Sonny Walls while the remainder Police Quest games were produced by former L.A. Chief Daryl Gates, in a different style in both atmosphere, and later even in genre.  All 4 Police Quest games are recorded on Location by the Men &amp; Women of the Laytton Police Department.  All suspects are Innocent until proven Guilty in a Court of Law.   In Police Quest 1 EGA/VGA - In Pursuit of the Death Angel: Assigned to traffic duty, Sonny Bonds investigates what appears to be a simple car crash but turns out to be a homicide. Relieved by his supervisor, Sergeant Dooley, Sonny goes on a short coffee break with a fellow officer and returns to duty. He gives a traffic violation citation to a driver, single-handedly faces a tough gang of drunken bikers, and makes a DUI arrest. As the game progresses, he advances from patrol officer to temporary narcotics detective to undercover agent in hope of tracking down a murderous drug dealer named Jessie Bains, 'The Death Angel'. In order to find Jessie Bains, Sonny enlists the help of his former high school sweetheart, 'Sweet Cheeks' Marie, who is now working as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  In Police Quest 2 - The Vengence: After arresting Jessie Bains, Bonds is promoted to the homicide division. He begins dating Marie Wilkans, who helped him in his undercover work in exchange for the dismissal of prostitution charges against her as 'Sweet Cheeks' Marie. A dark shadow is cast over Sonny's happy life, however, when Bains escapes from prison and seeks revenge. With the help of his partner Keith, Bonds must protect his girlfriend's life as well as his own while pursuing 'The Death Angel' once again. Despite Sonny's efforts, Bains kills several people who were involved in his arrest and abducts Marie. Sonny pursues Bains to Steelton, the current home of Donald Colby, a reformed drug pusher from the original Police Quest.  In Police Quest 3 - The Kindred: Sonny and Marie are married following Bains' death. Promoted once more, Sonny now has to deal with rampant crime as a drug cartel begins operating in Lytton and evidence of a satanic cult starts to appear. When Marie is stabbed in a mall parking lot, Sonny's police work becomes personal. Sonny must deal with a partner with questionable ethics as well as find patterns in crime to find his next lead. The Bains family also plays a role in this game.  In Police Quest 4 - Open Season: You take the role as John Carey in Los Angeles, California. Carey, an LAPD homicide detective whose best friend was killed in the line of duty, must track down a serial murderer in L.A. where numerous mature themes are depicted in the game, including hate crimes, Neo-Nazism, and youth involved in crime. Graphic imagery within the game also includes the body of a child murdered by gang violence and a severed head in a refrigerator."

494830,ViveSpray, Early Access Review
494990,Too Angry to Space,"This is very LOW quality game. It looks like some guy put together several levels in some kind of editor and call it a game.  Details: - animation of main character is made by few pictures (he is spiting every 2 seconds) - EN texts are obviously written by non native (as this review (-: ) - 'advanced' version of enemies are poorly made only by some red color overlay - there is no easing in animations etc.  Bigger issues: - level design is boring and uninteresting - control is very bad (for example you can't jump from platform to platfrom by holding left arow and jumping with up arrow, because there is some delay and sometime jump is not recognized, so you have to stop on each platform) - everything is repeating (animations, character sounds, enemies, everything) - difficulty is unbalanced - if enemy walks 'into' you, you are almost instantly death, but you may receive many shots with no problem  overall - this can be good web-based game or little thing for under 1€... nothing more..."
495010,丛林守望者（Ranger of the jungle）,"Ranger of the Jungle is a half-arsed mobile port and also a half-arsed Chinese to English translation.  I like my tower defense games and I particulary like Kingdom Rush. Ranger looked to be a decent Kingdom Rush clone so I snapped it up pretty quickly, but sadly it's not.  The gameplay is slow which doesn't make things easy, it just makes it tedious to watch a mistake play out. The larger-than-Kingdom-Rush characters and enemies make the game appear even slower. The characters - particularly in the towers - aren't consitently sized either.   The art, whilst generally good, is also not entirely consistent. Some of the sprites appear to be at lower resolutions than others and appear slightly blurry. The heros too are not similar with some cartoony and others more realistic.  Slow gameplay and okay art are hardly reasons to not recommend a game but when coupled with tedious stages that need to be replayed to level heros, that recommendation starts to wane. There's not a chance you'll beat a map on hard without significant grinding first.   Ranger of the Jungle is a skill based game that teeters on the edge of time-based / casual gameplay. Unlike Kingdom Rush, where letting an enemy slip through was a huge failure, Ranger will still award three stars even if a mass of enemies make it through.  The music is servicable but gets repetitive. The stage music is badly looped and ends abruptly before a starting again. The long stage play times make this really obvious. The sound effects are pretty minimal and utterly forgettable. With one exception: the enemy escaped sound is copied straight from Kingdom Rush.  Ranger's greatest failing is that it's unfinished. Clicks sometimes don't register on powers. Buttons are grey'ed out even though they are not disabled. Button text is sometimes in Chinese. English paragraphs just stop mid sentence. There are no graphics options, including fullscreen or resizable windows. There isn't even an exit button as, obvisouly, the mobile version didn't need one. Keys can't be rebound and the only actual keyboard shortcuts are for selecting heros and powers. There are no shortcuts to start the next wave, pause, navigate menus or skip tutorials.  Lastly some of the stages are copies of Kingdom Rush's, though generally mirrored horizontally. The towers are replicas of Kingdom Rush's with only the dwarven bombard tower replaced by a tree called The Ancient of War. The upgrade progession is identical with three general upgrades followed by a specialist choice.  All the similarities - and I'm being generous with the term - only serve show just how mediocre Ranger of the Jungle is when compared to Kingdom Rush. It didn't scratch my tower defense itch. Play Defense Grid instead."
495030,VR Battle Grid,"VR Battleships why?  I must admit in my wait for quality VR to become to become available I wasn’t thinking how amazing would it be if someone made a VR battleships. If you’re easily pleased get it, after all its free, I think maybe the novelty will wear off quickly. "
495090,Evolution Planet: Gold Edition,"TL;DR - Evolution Planet is an inferior clone of Triple Town, with a vastly larger and oxymoronic emphasis on random elements and pre-designed levels. Several levels in the game cannot reasonably be completed without purchasing creatures, likely a holdover from pay-to-win mobile game elements.  I'll be blunt - in every instance where the developer experimented with the game design instead of merely copying Triple Town, they failed. Enemy creatures that destroy yours (or in later levels, infect and convert yours), an AI that places creatures on your behalf and slaps down multiple creatures per turn, and 84 levels with their own sets of goals and score targets - all of these interfere with each other or with the core gameplay.  When the RNG decides to place multiple creatures at several critical points on the grid that completely wreck your plans, it's not fun. Doubly so when they're high-level creatures that destroy or convert your own creatures and reverse the past 20 moves of progress. That same RNG decides whether you can actually complete a level, which makes you wonder - why even have designed levels? Though, even 'designed' is debateable. Several levels in the game - particularly later boss levels - cannot be reasonably completed without spending gems to purchase creatures. Getting a triple star rating in some levels is also dependent on multiplier squares randomly appearing in the right places as well.  It should also be noted that getting a triple star rating on every level in the game gets you nothing, not even a text blurb of congrats. There is no point to completion. There is also no point to getting a high score in survival mode, as the top two scores are clearly hacked. Even at the end of my 3rd place run with a score of a quarter million points, there was such an incredible deluge of enemy creatures placed every other turn that it would be impossible for anyone to survive 4 times (2nd place) or 16 times (1st place) as long.  I don't recommend this game. I felt annoyed and cheated during most of my playtime, and for a puzzle game, the developers sure tried their best to eliminate strategy and planning."
495110,Enigmatis 3: The Shadow of Karkhala,a well polished HOG game that continuous the enigmatis saga   pros. good story good graphics ok music hi resolution decent game play time around 3 hours for the main story and 30 mins for the bonus story   cons. cheesy voice acting  bad pronunciation of names (some say fAng some say fEng)    i recommend this game.  i give the game 7/10 +1 for the cards = 8/10  if you dont need it bady then wait for it on a discount.
49520,Borderlands 2,"I can't handle this game xD. It's too hard for a FPS noob like me. Dying all the time.  Edit: I wrote that comment when I first played this game. But now I'm not a noob anymore. This game is still frustrating.  First, if you play solo. The drop rate is just crap. If you don't have a good weapon, you can't beat certain monsters (not even bosses). You end up dying all the time.  What if you play co op? It's even worse. This game is not challenging at all if you play co op. Boring, the precise word. To make it worse, the loot is not shared. So if you play with random a$$holes, you'll end up having nothing at all.  Definitely not recommended."

495580,Divided We Fall, Early Access Review
495700,Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers,"The old and sluggish interface can be somewhat frustating in the begining, but you tend to get used to it. Some of the puzzles are pretty nice, others just don't make that much sense or require a totaly abstract way of thinking. But then again, this is a thing with pretty much all the old point-and-click adventure puzzle games. The strongpoint of this game is definetly the story and the good character design. Almost all characters in this game have a story they tell in a direct or indirect way. I would certanly recommend this games for those willing and capable of playing some of the classics this genre has to offer!"

495890,Montaro,"Game is crap. Cute, true. Decent chiptunes. Falls apart when the 'health bar' is completely meaningless, since 90% of enemies are one-shot kills instead of taking health away (that is, everything except the banana peals on the ground). Wouldn't be so bad if the enemy spawns weren't 100% random and, most of the time, literally impossible to avoid since you lose control of your character for the majority of the game (whether mid-jump, being 'hurt' from the aforementioned banana peals, etc). There are literally times when the choice is 'die to that cat, die to that crow, or die to that manhole cover'.  Now I have to keep playing for another 2 minutes to actually post this review."

495960,The Secret Monster Society,Bought this thinking i'd have a fun game to play for more than one hour....got to the forbidden forest got out and then ROLL CREDITS. When's the next chapter suppose to be out??? I'm not a huge gamer but enjoyed this game. Just extremely dissapointed that the first chapter was all i got when i thought i was buying a lot more. SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING!!!!

495990,True Love ～Confide to the Maple～,"It's a bad game, and maybe the worst game I had ever played. Because of plagiarism. I love chinese games but this one is really bad and alleged copyright infringement. Is this game worth the purchase price? Absolutely not.  The reviews of this game are counterfeiting acts. Save your money and don't buy this game,this one don't worth the price even it sales for $1.  0/10"

496030,Dark Parables: The Swan Princess and The Dire Tree Collector's Edition,"The Swan Princess and The Dire Tree is the 11th game in the Dark Parables series. Though stand alone, for anyone who has been following this series there are omages to the previous games (Rapunzel #7 and Goldilocks #10 come to mind immediately) and adds even more history to the Prince James (Frog Prince #2) saga. (For those who care the 1st Swan Princess, Odette, was one of the Prince James' (Frog Prince) 5 wives. Also Ross Red (Prince Ross Red) is the fraternal twin of Princess Snow White, now Queen Snow White also known as the Snow Queen (# 3), who was also one of Prince James' 5 wives.) I do so enjoy a series that keeps their overall long term story straight and without plot holes. But enough about the series as a whole.   Storyline: As soon as the flying 'Seed of Life' from the Dire Tree (omage to Yggdrasil, Tree of Life) germinates it is stolen by the Black Swan, a title giving to a Swan Guard traitor in the Swan Kingdom on Dire Island. (Swan guards are the lifelong protectors of the Goddess Flora and the Dire Tree.) The whole Swan Kingdom and the entire island of Dire is now facing utter destruction since the 'Seed of Life' used in a life regenerative ritual by the Goddess Flora now can not be performed unless returned. Huge lava filled cracks are appearing all over the island and the present and 6th Swan Princess has sent for aid. That aid comes from the Master Tailor (omage to a fairy tale), who can literally sew the earthen cracks shut with his enchanted 'sword' which looks like a sewing needle, and you, the player as the Fairy Tale Detective. Your task find the traitor, the Black Swan (once Head of the Swan Guards) and the flying 'Seed of Life' then return them both to the Swan Princess. The situation is not as it seems, appearances are deceiving and everything changes when the Goddess Flora dies. (Chapter 2). The mission then becomes find out what is really going on, the reasons behind everything and of course, saving the Swan Kingdom from annilihation. That is part of the job description after all, Fairy Tale Detective.   The Game: 8 chapters plus 2 bonus chapters. Intricate storyline that has all the plot twists of a corkscrew with magic, mayhem, intrigue, treachery and murder. And I still call this a family friendly game.   Fast travel map with things to do highlighted with a star. Pastel color pallette. Built in strategy guide. Four game modes: Casual, Hard, Insane and Custom. No hand holding in this game, and at times the clues are a bit obsure, if not missed because the dialogue disappears way too fast. Personally I recommend Casual for all the little sparklies that are hard to see anyway and the hints on the fast travel map. No reason not to play on Casual. There is no achievement for playing on Hard mode. There are no hint penalties unless in Hidden Object Puzzle (HOP) and no skip penalties. The in-game achievements are same as the Steam achievements. There are even trading cards.   All achievements can be earned in a single playthrough, and if any are missed (except the parables) during gameplay (including the collectibles) they can be picked up through the Extras menu. All Hidden Object Puzzles (HOPs) and mini-games can be replayed in the Extra menu. There is a mini-game called Souvenirs where the player goes back through every scene in the game and looks for a single item (watch for cursor change, if the item is not immediately apparent.) The Extra menu includes art concept, wall papers, music, video, etc. The main game screen includes buttons for achievements, parables and collectibles so the player can keep track of their progress without leaving the game.   One of the newest features of the game series is the 3D elements. This feature is quite prominent when opening smaller boxes. Also they have stirred away from the traditional morphing/ghost objects and made their morphing objects (which morph into a flower) their parable pieces. The other extra hidden find, the collectibles, are tiny acorns with wings on both sides. Some of these can be quite tough to find. (Did I mention that built in strategy guide that so happens to have at the end the location of all parable pieces and acorn collectibles.)   Gameplay: A smooth blend between point and click, problem solving, HOPs, and puzzles. Nothing is contrived, all four of those elements appear where they should. Point and click to adventure about, problem solving when a task needs to be done, HOPs when looking for or needing a specialized object like a key and puzzles on anything that locks or opens usually.   The problem solving bits can be a bit obsure at times and chase about on the fast map. But it does not happen often and the clues are there. Just be very observant, click on everything, and look for cursor changes. Some places are rather small in out of the way places or seemingly unimportant places like a brazier at the top of a staircase. Everything is very logical in the story progression and what one would normally do if presented with the same type of situation in real life. And yes, keys are the only thing that open locks. (Though the 'key' may not necessarily be a standard type of key. Gems are used as keys.)   The HOPs are pictures unlike the usual list finds. These types of HOPs are standard for this series. Basically some object has been disassembled into pieces and the HOP consists of finding all the pieces. The game will automatically assembly the pieces when finished. The pieces are divided into three different sections, so as the pieces of each section are all found that part will assembly itself. When all three sections have assemblied, those three pieces will assembly into the completed object and go into inventory. Once the mind accustoms itself to this, the HOPs can become very easy. Nothing is unfairly hidden, though some pieces are half hidden behind other things or obsured in some way, and the size or color can change slightly. Color changes are generally due to 'poor light' or 'shadows' in the game scene. For example the game scene is heavily shaded by trees and slightly in creviss. Every item is drawn according to these light conditions. Though in this game finding the mosaic pieces on the mosaic itself was a challenge. It was like looking for jigsaw puzzle pieces on the jigsaw puzzle itself.  The puzzles are varied, diverse and something NEW. There are several types of mazes including a vertical tower maze, sliders, rotators, a jigsaw puzzle, a tangram, a recipe, logic puzzles, matching and a NEW type of puzzle my friend mickmane called a logic connector. I would call it a math logic connector or even a circuitry puzzle. These puzzles are found on the rune pedestrals. How they work is there are numbered dice (the amount of connections allowed) scattered all over the board and to solve the player must connect lines to every die for that amount of connections. Seems simple when hearing it explained, looks daunting when seen, and logic is the name of this game. And it is NEW. After a lifetime of puzzles, I have never played this type of puzzle before. Thumbs up!!  Well I think I covered everything, and thanks for putting up with all the history about Dark Parables but I have been playing this series since 2010, more then once. I highly recommend this game even at full price. It is a bit more difficult then the usual fare and certainly not cookie cutter or predictable."
496180,GE Neuro,"This shouldn't count as a game. It's more of a slightly (barely) interactive tech demonstration. It does not utilize any input device other than a few keys on the keyboard (for recentering the VR seated position and choosing medium or high quality) and Vive room scale (and it doesn't even use room scale at all, it just supports it).  Pros:  1. It's free.  2. One of the most visually satisfying Vive demos I've experienced.  3. It's somewhat educational and very inspiring.  Cons:  1. It's 2GB.  2. It's only 5 minutes long!  3. Not really scientific.  Overall, this should be experienced if you've just started using the Vive or the Oculus as it shows off the VR visual capabilities very well. Download it, experience it for 5-10 minutes, delete it, move on."
496190,Senza Peso,Extremely short and boring.
496230,Watching Grass Grow In VR - The Game,PROS:  - Music choice good.  - Asteroid = sweet  - Challenging  - GRASS!!!  Cons:  - Price = bad  - Only one game mode.  - Just needs more stuff and things!  #TrashOrTreasure #Trash   If caught on a sell you can get a good game. 15 to 20 minutes of fun but not worth the price right now.

496260,Corona Blossom Vol.1 Gift From the Galaxy,It's just like Nekopara... but with different characters. And with mechas. And extraterrestrials.
496300,Kingdom: New Lands,"There's more stuff, but it's less fun that the original. All you have to do in this one is clear one side (which don't even produce counterattacks after the small portals are down) and then build the boat, which is way easier than the original where you had to clear both sides and survive a massive counter-attack from both sides at the end. I'd still recommend this one, but I'd recommend the original over it."
496310,Momento Temporis: Light from the Deep,"  2D MetroidVania Type game.   Can be challenging as well, kill stuff use there essence to get stronger.  Highly reccomend using a controller while playing, Keyboard wasn't too nice to me in the quick to move moments.   Had fun playing it, will return to play some more and find out whats in the Deep"
496320,Running Gods,This game is very fun in multiplayer ! I really like the graphic design ^^ Good job guys :)
496380,A Verdant Hue,"   https://youtu.be/m__enEPnklc   The game is a very simple farm sim. That doesn't mean its bad and in fact it is quite good for passing time. For that main reason I am going to give it a thumbs up. I always worry when buying a compilation that most of the games will take 15 minutes to tire out. This is not one of those games for me. Is there much in the way of skill? No, but thats also not the point of the game.  The game does have some oddities. The first thing I do not like is the walking movements. Pathing is not very good and you can't change direction mid movement. The day also passes faster than I would like. I also had a not so fun bug in which when I got a reward from a neighbor, the screen would not close. No matter what. The only way to fix this was to start a new game.  Otherwise I would give it a 5/10 which for me is a small thumbs up."
496390,Shiny,"  'Fans of platform games will definitely not be disappointed by Shiny. It looks beautiful and works just fine. Shiny proves that a videogame doesn’t need violence to be fun. Shiny reminded me of Rayman Legends, because every level looks awesome and there has been attention to create some new side scrolling tactics. Where Rayman is loud an bright colored, Shiny is calm and brings a world build out of metal to life. The developers clearly paid much attention to every detail present in the game while developing it, which really shows. I took the role of Kramer 227 without hesitation and I loved every energy-gathering and energy-spending minute of it!'  To read our full review or other epic stuff, please visit  www.dumeegamer.com!

496400,Renoir,"  Played it a bit, like the vibe and narrative, puzzles are a bit simple so far, through this is probably personal. Will be playing this one, story holds quite some intrigue."
496440,The Challenge,   Early Access Review
496460,Life is Feudal: Forest Village, Early Access Review
496490,Virtual Battlemap,I have only had this about 6 hours and I have already lost myself in creation of places (one of which I have no need for but it just kindof happened). I am not much of an artist but placing these objects in 3D space for me has been a very fast process. I have some ideas for DLC I would like to see but all of the basic structures you need are available in DLC already. I am very happy with my purchase and now I have no excuse to get to building maps. Thank you very much.
496530,Pigmentone,"Its a really good game and casual in the good way. The difficulty is very progressive, some puzzle can get really complex.   But dont worry there is more than 50 levels, so you have time to play them all. Game have really cheap pricetag and very   well done (unity)  Developer of Sliverbroom continue to improve the game, they just put some badges and cards a couple of days ago~ (more challenge for me!)  Small request: an easy mode for the 10 first levels only where the 'help system dont punish you' ;)"
496550,Noob Squad,"This game is complete ♥♥♥, so much motion blur to the point where it is unplayable"
496590,Crystal Cosmos,"This shoot them up is really beautiful. The game is a question of color. You have to kill the enemies with the right color and the most difficult part, it is when the ennemies are a combination of the basic colors... you have to find which colors are right to kill them.  The story? The Universe is in danger, Chaos became stronger and kicked you in the ♥♥♥. You are playing the Law, you need to train, to learn more tricks and when you will be ready, you will push Chaos to its place and find the right balance for the Universe.  "
496610,Push The Crate,"Just bought this game and played 2nd level and noticed the block would shoot to the other side and force me to restart then when it would move correctly it would then shoot past the gate and into the weeds making me restart.. not sure if that is intended or just a flaw that needs to be fixed by the developer. otherwise this is a good game to play when you just want to wind down from the big games and play something simple.. (sorry for run on sentences its 5:20am lol) i recommend this title, and support the developers!"
496630,Empty Horizons,"The art in this game is very nice, so I am sorry to say that the story is booooooring and long-winded. Almost nothing happens. There's one vaguely interesting twist near the end... and it takes hours of boring dialogue about nothing to get to it. Not worth it.  This VN forces you to get through the whole darn story as a kinetic novel--that's right, no choices--before it unlocks the one and only choice you can make in the game. Each subsequent choice unlocks new 'plot', so you have to suffer through more boring story again and again.  I mean, you don't HAVE to. I'd paid for this VN so I felt like I should go through all the choices. I kept hoping that maybe something interesting or cool was hidden in there somewhere.  It wasn't."
496640,Strange Night,This game is about a man who is also a zebra (some horror elements along the way)  SPOILER :    I'm gonna make you wear a little dress and hurt you so bad   
496650,Antihorror,"hey you gotta help out the shitman make some ♥♥♥♥ pies, y'know. ya ragamuffin. pm me for details"
496680,SweatShop,This game has bugs everythings was working fine till it crashes or you save and come back later but you find you have lost all of you progress and the achievements are bugged. unless you play in 1 sitting and don't turn off your computer until all complete i guess.
496730,Sorcerer King: Rivals,This was my first time playing Sorcerer King: Rivals and I really enjoyed it. Reminded me of my all time favorite game Masters of Magic in some ways. Worth the purchase in my opinion and thank you to the developers.
496750,The Housewife,"I am a female, I do consider myself a feminist and I purchased this game to try to get another perspective. I tried to sympathize with misogynists who think that women should be used as servants and see from the point of view where that idealogy would come from. This game was extremely unrealistic. I did not have enough time to clean the house before my husband got home, it seemed that the time given was super unrealistica nd there was no way I could have the entire house clean in that short of a time span. I'm not sure if the creators if this game thought that it was funny, but it is really not funny. Women have to deal with this harsh reality of not having the house clean before their husbands get home on a day to day basis. It is nothing to make fun of and mock. It is really hurtful to me as a female in the gaming community that games like this even exist."
496760,Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within,sadly i cant recommend this game as it crashes in the last chapter where grace has to use the opera glasses. other wise if wasnt for this a great game but not if you cant finish it .
496810,MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies,"I'm Nep fans, I see it, I like it. . .  This is what i expect co-op game from IF"
496850,Brick Battalion,"  This game is a ton of fun. I really enjoyed being in the beta and plan on playing it quite a bit now that it's live! It kind of reminds me of Robotnick's Mean Bean Machine from the Sega Genesis only in space with up to 8 player PVP or 4 Players vs 4 AI PVE.  If you aren't the competitive type, there is a 1 Player vs 1 AI mode and if you are looking for the ultimate challenge, hop into Gauntlet mode where you face off against progressively more difficult and numerous AI ships in an endless mode. It's definitely worth the $7.99 sale price if you love puzzle games.  PS...The leader boards give you something to strive for, so give it a try and try and dethrone the #1 player (not me :D)"
496890,Replica,"This game has a message that's somehow more heavy-handed than the totalitarian regime it's modeling. The 'puzzles' are unreasonable, the pacing is glacial, the referential nonsense is painful, and it's not even possible to exit, as far as I can tell.   A truly abysmal piece of writing and game design."
496910,DrumKit VR - Play drum kit in the world of VR,"The only good part is that the one sound bank is quite good and the triggers modulate the sound with the 'strength'. Other than that, there's nothing else. Notice the time played on any review.  It's a static scene that triggers sounds whenever the control passes through some colliders. Much worse than an eletronic drum kit (of course for the physical feedback, but I mean it has no other attractive point that could easily be made in the virtual world).  The lack of features make this useless and not even fun. There could be at least a way to reposition and add drums, Default positions is weird and unnatural like the floor and snare drum horizontal and far appart. The ride sounds like a crash, so uncanny, and that's the only sound bank. Cymbals response/physics are erratic and driven. The tech is clearly amateur: among other stuff, there's unused shadow casting that produces a flicker of the drum sticks that makes it hard to judge positions.  It's not even a nice VR demo. If this test was published as it is (clearly the first result of someone fiddleing with a game engine), I doubt there'll be any update to it."
496930,Sumeru,"This game has a really a good physics based concept, &amp; exceeded my expectations. Definitely more of a puzzler than platformer where walking &amp; jumping is minimal, with an emphasis on creating bridges, levers, swings, ramps, even catapults to manipulate your way forward. Even though I can’t freehand draw with a mouse, my sloppy lines would eventually find a way to work.  There are a few other types of puzzles along the way, with the later more complex levels being engaging &amp; quite juicy. A bit short, a bit sublime, &amp; a must for physics-puzzle gamers."
496940,Second Death,"So I bought this game thinking 'okay, this game is $3. Dont expect it to be great.' Well I was wrong. This game is amazing so far! Granite I have not put an entirely long amount of time into this game. Although I plan to! This game has so many skills I could not decide on what to upgrade. Which I like about games. Always making me think before I choose something. Great crafting, a lot of that, Exploring is fun. The combat I have never seen before, so when I first saw I was a little nervous, but it is really fun. It is like a combination of Fruit Ninja and Child of Light. Which might sound weird but it works really well. Really cool amazing game. Being $3. Definitely worth it! This is exactly what I have been looking for. Anyone who is looking for an rpg survival game with story and lots of content, You have found it. I know this game just came out, but do you have any ideas for maybe adding DLC into the game? Or just adding more? I know there is a lot now, but I already want more :) 10/10 from me. Keep it up! EDIT: DEVELOPERS! I FOUND A BUG WHERE SOMETIMES WHEN A BATTLE LOADS IT GOES FOR A SECOND THEN THE BATTLE FREEZES, NOT THE GAME AS I CAN STILL PAUSE THE BATTLE BUT IT DOESNT RESTART IVE LOST LOTS OF PROGRESS PLEASE FIX! :)"
496980,Cosmic Cavern 3671　　宇宙最大の地底最大の作戦,"Too bare-bones for the price, not as 'arcade' as the trailer would imply, this game would improve a lot if it had a bit more variety, or a level editor, like Lode Runner, or 'solve the situation' puzzle stages.  As is, I can't recommend."
497050,ShapeShifter,FLAPPY 'SHAPE SHIFTER' BIRD  nice graphic but i came for the music (soundh0und can help you detect the music) ps:not a sponsorship i buy this with 90% coupon so its okay   100/100 people found this review useless :p
497080,Construct: Escape the System,"This game is pure ambient art, it looks so good just staring at the world you're in, you might be lost considering what to do at first, but worry not my friend, the game will guide you, it's an FPS platformer where you'll have to reach your goals, escape and use your brain. It's as fun as it looks."
497090,Amihailu in Dreamland,"Mysterious so far, I'll update this when I finish it.  Edit 1: So far I'm having an iffy time with the game. It's confusing and doesn't point you in any direction. Any secrets I find seem to have no purpose so far or I'm doing something wrong."
497100,FootRock,"FootRock is an alright game for achievement hunters. It's not too fun on it's own if played for any reason other than achievement hutning, and while not plagued by bugs or issues with physics (something too common in 60 cent bargain bin sale games), this game just isn't fun beyond the achievements you gain. You finish your achievements list after only about 1/3 of the total game's levels, there are no collectible-related achievements for coins. This means that all you have to do to 100% this game is progress through the levels without worrying about the coins along the way, which makes some levels substantially easier.  I'm recommending this game solely on the basis that you're playing it for achievements or completionist prestige, if you are, this is a pretty fun game to play, again, I didn't feel frustrated or jipped on a lot of my deaths, and knew what I did wrong and how to correct it. It's worth the &lt;1 hour you will put in to finish the achievements list."
497150,DJ Streamer,"Great software, easy to use, stupidly simple. All out great. Nothing is broken from what I can tell so far. The only slight problem I have is that I can't share half the music I chose, because of the high bitrate. Apparently the software doesn't run 320kbps songs, or maybe I'm just missing a setting configuration. Either way, the software is cheap, easy to use, and works. Totally recommend."
497180,Street Legal Racing: Redline v2.3.1,Fix the game. Im tired of constant bugs. I downloaded some workshop item and i cant even load into my garage. I had to delete the mods and verufy the game files through steam to play the game. I have a more than capable enought computer to run the game so its not my computers fault. The game is supposed to be able to handle &gt;2 gigabytes of mods. It cant handle a few hundred megabytes.

497360,"Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned","After playing all the others then getting to this game...... I am hurt.  I dont liek the mechanics, the voice over, the graphic. Anything. I Just finished number 2 andI really dont think I can make myself play this game...."
497400,1 Moment Of Time: Silentville,"As a hidden object game, it is not really too bad, but absolutely not a good one.  The game is cheap in price, but the graphic also at low level quality.  Story board?  Never mind, who would expect a good story from this type of game. Anyway, the comic presentation of story telling is OK."
497420,Pixelscape: Oceans,A beautiful game; a lightweight aquatic scenery building game that warms the hearts of builders and fans of creative gaming. I would pay £10.99 for this so the price is a steal!
497430,G Prime Into The Rain,I normally don't play these types of games but at the suggestion of a friend I picked it up. I was pleasantly surprised with G-Prime. I was just going to test it out for a few minutes but an hour later I realized I was late for a meeting! I kinda lost track of time playing it. The game is challenging and engaging. I love the art inside the cockpit of the ship. My one strike against It is that it seems as though this is a port from xbox because in the tutorial it says “RB” and looks like a bumper symbol. All in all it’s a good game. 
497460,Mervils: A VR Adventure,"Bought for 20 bucks, expecting compatibility with the Rift as it claims - but whenever I launch the game it crashes immediately and freezes Steam. Not sure if this has to do with my dual GPU setup or what, but my primary monitor and rift are on the same GPU so I shouldn't be running into any severe issues like this."
497470,D.N.Age,"The game has an interesting concept, but the 'adventuring' is super grindy having no varation aside from what monsters you face, and once you figure out how to get the best DNA for a species it is super grindy to do that (sometimes requring more grinding of the adventuring variety). But ottherwise the artwork is cute, but it is too much work to get it."
497490,Project Hovercraft,"THE PERFECT GAME WHEN YOU JUST WANT TO BLOW STUFF UP!  Excellent use of UE4, great textures and levels and fun multiplayer gameplay that is as easy as just click and go!  A great title from Allusio!"
497580,Agent Walker: Secret Journey,I really enjoyed this game. It's a typical Artifex Mundi hidden object game. Not sure why it is getting bad reviews.
497590,Sapper's bad dream,"Game is unplayable af. Just as you think you're getting somewhere game crashes(not my pc, this is a pc that can run skyrim on highest setting) and as it has no saves the real point of the game becomes: complete the level before game crashes. I don't think whoever made this knew what they were doing in the least."

497860,Zezenia Online,"Gameplay is a lot of fun, and easy to pick up. Art doesn't work though and the different angled perspectives can be jarring at times. I still recommend giving it a try because it's fun to play, and if you adjust to the graphics you'll be fine and happy."
497940,Destiny of Ancient Kingdoms™,there is nothing called game securty. Everyweek new hackers join among us. Do not even think about playing. Just keep going for another game until Hackers are removed and game security is provided.
49800,Flight of the Icarus,I don't recomend getting this game slowly gets more boring and repetitive.
498030,Barnyard Mahjong 3,almost free game ♥♥♥♥
498040,The Hidden Dragon,"Well, this game is bad. Really bad. First of all, as many already have stated, it's very hard. Usually you have to finish the level in less than 20 seconds, but still most of the levels can finished in two tries. Despite its challenging nature, the game can be finished in less than 90 minutes if you're not going to collect three stars on each level. But the main problem is misspelling of certaing words. For example, the 'scarecrow' is called 'fox', and the 'horns' (in multiple form) are called 'horn'. There are other examples, but I'm not too eager to play this game again. And to top it off, some items are invisible without a tip because they are hidden behind the game menu. Good luck trying to find them by yourself."
498050,Mystery Of Rivenhallows,"Short and fun little mystery. Played with my son, who is new to point-n-click games. It was challenging enough that I needed to point him in the right direction several times but easy enough he got to enjoy figuring out some of the puzzles himself. We finished in about 2 and a half hours  If you are looking for a really challenging mystery that will keep you working for hours to find the answer, look elsewhere. If you want something short, fun, and a bit of a challenge, this game is worth trying."
49810,CreaVures,"This game is one huge bug. The controls are boasted in reviews to support both XBox and PS3 controllers, well, guess what? It doesn't work with PS3 gamepad AT ALL. The game recognizes that I plugged a gamepad in, but it defaults to Xinput, shows me buttons from XBox gamepad to press, and my PS3 buttons do not work. I had to use a 3rd-party app to map controls along, but they still work only partially, and, well, I just give up. Even with keyboard the controls are awkward and frustrating, random buttons in random places, the characters either overjump or jump not far enough, etc.   Also, opening Setting page after you just loaded the game leads to... black screen. If you were running it fullscreen - hello hard reset! It looks to me that even the developers didn't play their own game, otherwise they would have seen this bug.  The only good thing about this game is visuals, but the bad controls butchered it for me."
498190,Dragon Rage,"Great game for what it is, small game but reasonably priced. Such satisfaction in slaming into everything and getting those power ups to easily stay ahead and achievements that aren't complicated/cryptic as ****.  When I first saw the negative reviews for this game, I hated what they put into the reviews because all they said was its too short or I paid too much for so little content. How about they try to make a game all by themselves?! It's not easy. Give these people some slack because I'm pretty sure those negative review people don't even think about how hard it is to make a game.  The service from the game creator that I had was above perfect. I was pretty surprised that it was responded to and taken care of so quickly. Then again I usually play huge games like Paladins or Heroes of the Storm where it could easily be ignored. I really appreciate this guy and hope there are others like him out there."
498240,Batman - The Telltale Series,"I've been a fan since the '92 animated series, and this is one of the best depictions of Batman I've seen yet, primarily because they set it in an alternate continuity with some very harsh (and likely controversial) twists on the formula. Well worth playing the demo, and if you enjoy that you'll enjoy the rest of the season."
498280,Jurassic Survival, Early Access Review
498300,Of Love And Sorrow,"I love visual novel and choice stuff. Here's my summary of this game.  1. Story, I kind of like this story at first. Intriguing plot. But it's more like a novel than role-playing novel. For one thing if you're writer for this kind of game, you shouldn't describe how your character feel(which is too many lines for this). You should describe what your character see, taste, touch, smell and everything. You let player feel all emotion and moral consequence themself.  2. Choice, not much of them. Mostly all you can do is clicking 'continue'. Choices only affect minor change but not ending, it's a BIG disappointment. If it's only one ending it shouldn't be visual novel at the first place. As far as I play through the end I don't see any skill training (Riding, shooting and so on) affact to any line of the game, then what it's for. You can't call it minor change, if it's just extra page to read.  3. Typo, lots of them.  I want to support writer but seriously this is not a game, it's more like a printed novel."
498330,Cats are Liquid - A Light in the Shadows,"iz gr8  this game is gr8. although I just bought it today i find it really fun and addicting. even though its gameplay is super simple its still really fun I can't imagine a human being not enjoying this (not sarcastic). I'm being legit, this game is gr8!"
498340,Shards of Azuria, Early Access Review
498360,Puzzle Nebula,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
498450,A Week of Circus Terror,I am really disappointed in this game. For the first time you get scared of the bear and that's it... Every time the screen goes dark you know what's coming for you. There is no need for me to continue playing this game. Please change this and will have a look at this maybe later. Thanks a lot. @Vote No for now
498510,DreamLand,"I'm excited for whatever the developers end up producing from this pretty little demo/preview, but the loading screen as well as the part where the world shakes are both wretched even for people who have their VR legs. That kind of nausea-inducing nonsense should be illegal. Even though it's free I have to urge new virtual reality gamers not to try it, as it might cause physiological harm, or at least make them hate VR..."
498570,Extreme Forklifting 2,"even for £1 this game became very boring &amp; repetative after only 10 mins. nothing changed. also if they made it a bit more realistic if could have been more interesting (use the analogue stick to control forks, so you can drive &amp; control like a real one) also dont make it spin out all the time (they just never do that). I was disapointed."
498580,ASRECorp,"  Really nice fps adventure game and well made with gorgeous graphics and story. Like the way that you walk around free ways for exploring and searching for hidden puzzles or such. It has great potential, great sound and very interesting game. I would recomend it."
498600,MSI Electric City,"This is a commercial for MSI. Don't waste your time. PLEASE steam don't do this to your subscribers. This title should be in a category for advertising. Are we in such need for VR ware that we have to watch this? Did I spend $800 on VIVE to watch commercials? No.   Steam, you should charge MSI for every download as an advertising fee. Or, maybe you already do?  ;)"
498620,The Shadowland,"I like the look of the graphics. I find the sillouettes of living people going about their business pretty charming. But the controls feel ultra-finicky, and the environs come at you a bit too fast. Also, no gamepad support? Who plays platformers with a keyboard...? Disappointed."
498660,Mind Spheres,Awesome game i love it.
498830,Mustache in Hell,Graphics - 8.0 Sound - 7.5 Gameplay - 9.0 Overall - 9.0  Awesome Game
498940,"WarBirds Dawn of Aces, World War I Air Combat","Rather mixed feelings about this game,WarBirds Dawn of Aces World war 1 Air Combat.The aircraft and Zeps look extremely good, as does the sky.Conversely the ground does not,it looks old and even with a fair to reasonable rig looks poorly done..The game automatic picked up 3 features on my Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick yet steadfastly refused to acknowledge or responed to the other 8 buttons.The learning to 'fly ' or play the game is very strange as you are learning in a P51 or a Me 109. With HUD's .. WTF? And you don't start as aspiring pilot Lt.Flyboy,Flying Corp, no way..you try and become eligible for the Richthofen(what ever that consists of) part of the game by doing missions.It's an odd set up you are a gunner ,then a Brit pilot next a french homme de l'air but it is rather good fun even with a certainly not helpful joystick set up.. .Dogfighting is good, AA and gunfire seems about right and the sound track and music is OK.Settings from arcade to sim,no bugs or crashes just a bit strange over all .. ..It's not a patch on IL2 Sturmovik 1946 but it's not bad fun all the same....."
498980,DUO,"I play this game from time to time. So far there's not much of a challenge. You just deflect the balls. It can be oddly relaxing though. Basically like an endless version of the demo.  Not terrible, but hard to recommend as a game I usually I toss it in while I decide which other game to play."
49900,Plain Sight,Bought this on October 2010. Got me a 4-pack and up to this date still have a copy with me that nobody wants. The multiplayer of the game is now dead. Also I have but 2 hours of play and already got bored of this. I definitely don't reccomend.
499100,Dark Parables: The Exiled Prince Collector's Edition,"Good job from Blue Tea games and Dark Parables series as always! although not as colorful and a bit repetitive compared to its amazing sequels, The Exiled Prince still has an intriguing story and a lot of beautiful objects to find."
499110,Dark Parables: Rise of the Snow Queen Collector's Edition,"I bought the Dark Parables Package. Wow, amazing games. The graphics are so beautiful, I found myself relaxing and getting a little lost in the fantasy worlds. Lots and lots of hidden objects and puzzles that were mostly a challenge. 10 out of 10!!!!!"
499120,Dark Parables: The Red Riding Hood Sisters Collector's Edition,"One of the best puzzle games I've played. The story was actually engaging and dramatic, plus I love the design of the villianess."
499230,SurvHive, Early Access Review
499330,Lord Mayor,"Neat idea.   I wouldn't buy it, even cheap, until game breaking bugs are fixed (at times, you enter the building select screen and when you leave it the screen fades but does not completely vanish, preventing you from building or doing anything at all).  Also, because the game is real time, the building screen should pause time."
499340,Turner,"This game isn't worth your money, let alone your time. It's uninspired in all aspects, and unsatisfying to play. Give this one a hard pass."
499370,Tower of Archeos,"  Neat game. The concept of dungeon crawling mixed with match puzzling is interesting and pretty well handled, but it is absolutely brutal. Has a good deal of replay value due to how fast runs can be, find myself playing a round every once in awhile after I initially played it for review. The sprite art is also pretty great, some cool animatiions here and there. My only major complaint is that the price tag is a bit high for what's offered here, but this is definitely one to snag on a 30% sale or so."

499440,klocki,"extremely good short puzzle game that you can finish in about an hour and a half. this game is similar to hook in that it starts off simple then adds new mechanics and gets harder, unlike hook this game is very colorfull has more levels and more interesting mechanics, and is more difficult. definetly worth its price"
499460,Tomato Jones,It's a great game about tomatos...... Thats about it.   (its a fun one for streaming)
499540,Wake Up,Great &amp; long for a freebie! Better than some of the stuff I've spent money on. And the puzzles were actually challenging and engaging without being too frustrating. But my ears were too dumb for the music puzzle and I just had to use trial and error...whoops...  Hope to see more from this dev!
499610,Copter and Sky,It looked very fun as a fan of drones but I was dissaported by the lack of worlds and controls that cound not be changed to my liking. VERY BAD DO NOT BUY -9000/0 IGN.  This is what I said when I asked for a refund this game is ****
499620,Ultimate Booster Experience,Not good - dont waste your money or time
499760,Redswood VR, Early Access Review
499900,Pulse Shift,"finally game which is something different. Game design and graphic art are awesome, if you are looking for game where you don't must shoot from point A to the point B like a monkey and you want more from games, this is game for you. Its really relaxing and same time hard for your brain."
499950,Metal Assault - Gigaslave - Europe,"This game died twice. First (as Metal Assault) when Aeria Games resigned to still keep this game in Europe. Second (As Gigaslave) when it was on strange servers in Taiwan.  But now. We can play again!  So first: you have 4 playable characters, 4 gamemodes, 5 types of weapons (6 if they added broken flamethrower from Gigaslave [I hope not]), nice graphic style, unique abilities unique playstyle concept.  But still there are still many elements missing. Like more weapons in shops, not translated 1 button ;P, resolution should be better, aiming with sniper rifle is real pain with this resolution.  And some my personal feelings: headshot should not give us this strange animation with blood, it just don't fit. Servers should be a little better becouse I see many ppl have high ping and where are weapons 'mastery'?  There is possibility that I ignore too many mistakes but it's free so I can recomend this game. You can check this game becoue I have not seen any other 2D shooter with elements of RPG this far."
50,Half-Life: Opposing Force,"tis' a good game. the perspective shift is nice, so you get a feel of what it's like to be in the ' antagonist's ' shoes, so to speak. also, cool weapon arsenal. guns, knives, wrenches, and aliens. yes. a l i e n s. and the protagonist, adrian, is cool, just like gordon and barney. ( also in dire need of a hug. they all need hugs. )"
500,Left 4 Dead,The best cooperative multiplayer game.
50000,Nimbus,"Simple: A+, only 4 buttons, left right brakes and reset, Goal: get from A to B.  Casual: A, I can turn this game on at any time to decompress, however there are some levels that just shouldn't be attempted if you have high blood pressure problems.  Difficulty Scale: C, they mark each level with a difficulty from 1-10, I find those markings somewhat arbitrary, you can accidentally stumble across hidden levels with low difficulty only to find them much harder than stated. *SPOILERS --&gt;* the final level throws such a curveball at you it can only be compared to the final level of Trine. It isn't necessisarily difficult per say, but its a massive shift in the pace of the game.  Replay value: B, you can easily get some of the bonus unlocks your first play through, the bonus tokens are very simple in the early levels, and the unlockable cosmetic modifications to your ship are fun, but it isn't going to bring you back if you aren't into that kind of thing.  ran out of room summary 9/10mustown"
500140,Wildlife VR,"A very basic shooting game, a limited selection of guns and you shoot 1 of 3 wildlife at a time as they run around on a pre-scripted route. Scoring is very basic, 1 point per kill and it doesn't track accuracy or have any goals. There is a Can shooting mini game, but again no real scoring or accuracy recorded. Just shoot some cans until you get bored.  Needs a lot more added to it until it becomes a game or something at least enjoyable to spend some time in it."
500190,Firefight,I Really enjoy this game but it is a bit of W.I.P with some missing features and the pathfinding can get your troops killed but a bit of work and support can make a bad game into an amazing one. And also this game is great idea that just needs more work
500360,VRMultigames, A half-decent tech demo for roomscale... and it's free.
500380,UNCORPOREAL - Fluffy!,A short but entertaining demo from an excellent movie. Gave me a bit of a jump at the end. Great use of the unreal engine.

500570,Mahjong Deluxe 2: Astral Planes,  Nice relaxing game.   I got this as gift  Thank you ' Dead by daylight Thailand ' TS3 GROUP
500580,Kitty Cat: Jigsaw Puzzles,"A basic jigsaw game involving cats. There's no music, and the only sound this game has is the button pressing sound. There are plenty of free jigsaw games on the internet, so don't bother buying unless this game is on sale. I would only buy this game if you were a hardcore jigsaw fan who also collects trading cards."
500590,Puppy Dog: Jigsaw Puzzles,Puzzles of puppy dogs that's it is really easy i think it was make to kinds i play it when i'm really bored so never   so if this game was ice it is valilla not good not bad  i give it 5 out 10 or 3 out 6

500680,Jockey Rush,"Excited to see a game with jumps racing took me a long time to get the hang of jumping. Fell at the first about 20 times in a row!! I am now getting the hang of it a bit more, you have to jump quite early to prevent falling. I even won a race today!"
500790,Moribund, Early Access Review
500810,Arcanum,I always loved this second only to the origional Fallout and Baldurs Gate games. Now that players have patched it and fixed the bugs i think it might even be the best RPG ever made.
500870,Riddles Of The Past,"I actually regret the spare change I spent on this bit of silliness. The ridiculously convoluted story was was a bit more asinine than the problem solving which included strange leaps of logic like 'use the carousel to move that pile of junk.' The hints in the game were generally useless, leaving me to hunt around the screen for things to click randomly and hope that something would start to make sense soon. The only thing that kept me going was my own stubborness and a sort of sick fascination with what the writers were possibly going to do to resolve everything.   Don't waste your spare change on this. Buy a cup of coffee, instead."

501030,Extravaganza Rising,"GREEN LIGHT DAWNS LIGHT 3 PLZZZZ!!   EDIT:   This game is amazing, Its like a dungeon simulator , you just keep leveling up,get new monsters.  Till this game is over.   Please do green light dawns light 3, Im so close to buying....  ALL your games. EVERY. LAST. ONE."
501050,Emerland Solitaire: Endless Journey,"I like this, and the best thing is - if you don't purchase lives then you won't sit there playing it for 20 hours straight. But I'm not sure that is the designers business model.  But it is an excellent distraction of a game for those moments you don't want to play an indepth game."
501110,Mount Wingsuit,"It's a great idea, and I would honestly love the game to pieces if it weren't for how inconsistent the controls were. One round, I'll have about a 30 degree difference between going up and going down, which is normal. You'd usually see a someone using a wingsuit have his arms around his thighs or so like that.   Then there are the random times, mid flight mind you, where my controls will suddenly require me to swing my arms almost 180 degrees to change from up to down or vice versa, and it's really annoying during my attempts at perfect runs, basically making them entirely impossible."
501180,Acan's Call: Act 1,Has great potential for the Vive. Be careful not to hit a (real) wall. The fighting gets intense.
501190,Axis Football 2016,Game is nice. . . But i wish they would add flags and customizing players without mods and this game is really laggy for me! Overall 8.5/10
501220,Space Ribbon, Early Access Review
50130,Mafia II (Classic),"From an entertainment viewpoint mafia 2 is not that fun.  Fun breakers are missing car shooting (e.g. police can shoot you and you can soak bullits), another fun breaker is forced drivings from A to B (often includes forced car selections).   What is missing is also the paranoia for the Family that is after you and the choices you would make for that not to happen. Another deal breaker is the money resets and gun removevals. Real criminals would have backup stashes.  Most cars almost drives the same and instead of wasting money on gas you just steal any other one. And why all the fistfights most criminals would just stab a guy."
501380,UNCORPOREAL - Alcatraz Island Lofts,"OK, after being told how much of an idiot I am and that I can't read, etc; This is what happens if you play without a VR Headset. Note; when this first released - it gave an indication that it could work with or without a VR Headset. They updated it to lead more towards VR Only now.  Also love how all the people defending this game have either not played it themselves - or just haven't thrown out an actual review for it since there are no positive reviews for it as of now.   https://youtu.be/p4SPAlU6j6s "
501430,Blue Solar: Chaos War,"  For me: 2D, pixelated Elite Dangerous Amazing Really try it  But add few more updates with more content."

501480,Lost Socks: Naughty Brothers,"I usually don't like runners, but this one is pretty fun and nervous,"
501500,Black Moon Chronicles,"Warning: not sure if this game works on Windows 10, can't get it to start messing about with compatibility settings etc.  Still reccomending as it was such a brilliant game when I played it from CD back when it first came out. As an RTS / tactical combat game I'd give it only about 6/10 , gamesplays not bad, but not smooth and not quite tripled A production values.  The outstanding qualities of this game are the old fashioned story telling, great music and voice acting, about half an hour of excellent in game movies. The setting is medieval / high fantassy and you have one faction that seems to be perfectly pure and good which makes a change from the shades of grey you get in most story telling these days.  Would buy and not be able to play again!"
501740,Dropship Down, Early Access Review
501840,Don't Disturb,I loved the game. I nearly cried at the end!! Even tho it's kinda short it so worth it. The story and art style is amazing. Feel so sorry for the dog but in the end it always will make me smile with happyiness. Hope the people who made this game make another because when they do I am so going to buy it. They did a good job.
501930,Sig.Null,"  I haven't done the hardest levels yet, but it takes a few minutes extra once and then to figure out how to do it, I like it more then some other puzzle games         YouTube™ Video:  Magnetic puzzle's Let's play SIG.NULL Gameplay [1080p/60fps]&nbsp;"
501970,Phantasmagoria 2,Epic oldschool horror adventure!  
501990,Phantasmagoria,"While this game played today has a few technical issues and the acting at times can be very lame, the game still holds up. This game during the time in 1996 when I originally played this game was very very good. There were very few mature games at this time and this game was one of the best. The item collection and game play was fun, plus the story itself was good. I think if you liked the old myst/11 hour games then you owe yourself a chance to play this. This game runs on dosbox which i think could be the reason for some of the technical issues, because back when I played it originally it didn't have the issues I came across in this version. Just make sure you save often and you won't have any issues. I still have the original game I played in 96 that has 7 cdrom discs which was unheard of at the time. It was fun coming to an end of a chapter and putting in the next disc seeing what the next chapter had in store. This updated version removes that but it is still a fun game and think people should check this game out."
502090,Invisible Mind,"This game should never have been on Steam. It is not developed or tested good enough, the technical quality is poor and the gameplay in bad. Just two examples: 1. you can load games, but you can't save them. 2. You can't read all the texts, because the text disappears out of the screen.  Charging money for this game is pure fraud. Steam: please remove this game from your library!"
502140,Drayt Empire,"A nice, fun, and silly little JRPG, Drayt Empire has enough colour, mindless combat, and a poppy soundtrack to keep you occupied for a few hours.   Firstly, while fun, it seems fairly unfinished - sounds appeared to be missing here and there, and there were enough spelling and grammatical errors to give anyone a headache. Second, most of the content seems to be taken from RPGMaker 'as is' which is fairly disappointing. There is apparently an update to the game that will amend this so I'll consider changing my recommendation on the game when that day comes. Finally, the story is fairly threadbare - JRPG after all, so crystals, demons, and saving the world.   This is one of those times that I wish that Steam had a mid-way point between pass and fail. Sure it's probably good for some warm and familiar fun, and it's flaws can mostly be overlooked if you're aware of them going in.   Pros  +Fun and silly JRPG-inspired game +Cheap   Cons  +Odd and unevenly told story +Like really odd - it just incorporates other JRPG tropes in a weird manner +Unsure if done ironically +Game doesn't appear fully finished - please hire a proof-reader!"
502150,Interstellar Logistics Inc,  A fun little space-physics puzzle game that has some neat eye-candy included.
502200,Orczz," https://youtu.be/ciOUs3UOhfM   Unfinished and unpolished, 'Orczz' is a lane defence game that only barely meets the requirements to be call that. Sprites are inconsistent in both size and quality. Text and UI layout is misaligned flowing out of frame. Levels and units are bland with an emphasis on bulk placement over decision making."
502230,Monsters' Den: Book of Dread,"Genuinely love this game, played it so many times online for free and was more than happy to spend £3 to get it on steam, especially considering that I usually had to start the game again every time I cleared my cache, and now I can save my progress/play multiple campaigns"
502240,You Deserve,"  Just play it for the cards...Oh no, wait, there aren't any. Although they advertise with it.  Mhh, okay play it for the beauty: 'Recommended grafics: Geforce 950You Deserv'...might look nice... WRONG, it looks like it would run on Onboard grafics.  Oookay, play it for the story...Meeep, there no real story. At least I didn't experience any.  Right, then, ermh, play it to get the creeps...It's not creepy at all, sorry. The Jump-scared are totally foreseeable.  For god's sake, just play it to laught about he bad english of the main character!! 'watt kaing of jaahk is sis? watt se faak?'"
502300,Heartomics: Lost Count,"  It's okay I guess, just not particularly my type of game."
502320,Boulder Dash 30th Anniversary,"played about 16hr at the point of writing this  i just love it so many levels and they did manage to capture the original boulderdash feeling i bought a lot of 'clones' to get back to the feeling this game gave me so long ago and none of them are just it, some come close ofc but nothing beats this  the powerup system is a cool add on to the original concept, a system of loot where you drop powerups or tokens to unlock other toons with some ability like more time more speed or for example longer lasting powerups add some long term goals to it  the dlc original reboot is cool but only 20 levels it feels so little compared to the amount this base game gives and thats fine its pretty cool to play them in a more modern way  the other dlc is hard and thats an understatement :)  if you loved the original i see no reason why you would not love this  9/10"
502400,Redactem,it's very boring. 24 level and end.

502550,Strike.is: The Game,Not Diep.io. Different classes which are distinguishable by weapons that the people are carrying.
502650,Autumn Park Mini Golf,"Great atmosphere! Very relaxing experience. The movement is a little wonky (there's a slight delay between hitting WASD and the character actually moving, and I found sometimes I would jump onto a green only to slide back off it), but it doesn't really get in the way of the fun.  It's only one course (hence the price), but if you're looking for simple chill-out fun, this will suit you nicely."
502710,The Last Sniper VR,this game is pretty cool i do however have a request to the devs make the scope bigger! its so small u can really look out it with a vr headset on and the parachute mission had me not wanting to jump *newsflash* they kicked my rear out of the plane =( i guess they decided to make me jump! the gameplay is really fun the planes flying by is pretty cool it is well detailed i would recomend it 8-10 be higher when they fix the scope issue it does get a bit annoying.
502740,50 years,   Early Access Review
502750,Quest for Glory Collection,First computer game series I ever play and it is still one of my favorites.
502770,Voodoo Garden,"This game is very adorable. It has a learning curve, but it's easy to figure out so that's not such a big deal. It's very much about clicking."
502880,The Janitor," https://youtu.be/vyCFqcRS-b0   An absolute tedious grind is the only way I can sum up this very poor effort. So its your typical cheap unity 'horror' game. Run around looking for things to collect in a level that features ugly graphics,minimal lighting, poor animations and annoying audio. I say things to collect I found one thing and could not find any thing else in the entire map.   This would at least be bearable if not for the fact that the enemy poo monster can easily kill you even if your in a locked room... This is just bad on every level. Then just to really get on your goat the game is riddled with bugs and crashes.   Not even worth it on a sale unless you are a sucker for self inflicted tedium."
502910,The Return Home Remastered,"I'll have to say that it was thoroughly unenjoyable with a really short repetitive music sample. No resolution options (or options menu at all in the main menu, with later in-game options for 3 graphics presets and audio levels (not tested)).  You have to run around a few 'levels'/islands you can teleport inbetween with portals, try and find all carrots, and apparently then you get a gun. I was missing 6 carrots and didn't feel like combing the islands again."
502940,"Calm Down, Stalin","For a game with such a simple and interesting concept, use a big red button as a deterrent while trying to avoid stress through various means, the sluggishness of the controls along with the erratic bouncing of the phone has ruined this game for me. This game is made needlessly more difficult in ways that could be so easily fixed and make this game so much more fun for players, from fixing the wandering of the hands to not needing multiply tries to pick up or let go of objects. As it is right now, this game isn't even worth 4$ to try out. After countless tries, losing because Stalin's hand decided to drift around, calls were ended because he couldn't hold a phone steady, letting go of an object and having it fall diagonally onto the red button, or fall straight down then roll across the table onto the button, among a variety of other ridiculous ways the game tries to make you lose, have made this game an irritating waste of time."
50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"This is a so so game. The promotion video is rather shocking but the actural play is mediocre: Just shooting enemy soldiers coming out endlessly from nowhere. The creator seems to have tried to give some depth to the game by introducing very weird story, but it just decreases reality. In fact the game play moves much smoothly if you skip all the silly and ugly videos. Just a TPS shooting game for killing a 2 or 3 hours. Nothing more than that."
503010,Azulgar: Star Commanders, Early Access Review
503100,Black Hat Cooperative,HEADS UP BEFORE YOU BUY.  There is a very good reason why a lot VR Games do the teleportation thing and this lets you move freely.  However that dosnt sound as nice as it turned out to be incridebly sickening. Almost with in 5 min of playing I really felt the need to hurl as you are moving and your body does not feel it so its not tricked like with the teleporting.  Concept seems awesome however if you are prone to motion sickness then stay the hell away. Shame too because it seems really rad.  UPDATE: Dispite that the game still should be given a shot. But if you are sensitive like then you may wanna try the alternatives but thankfully its not something that holds the game back!
503160,Angels & Demigods,"I wish there was a Neutral review option.   Seemed interesting, like the voice acting, but over all I am not sure the story clicks with me."

503450,Space Rangers: Quest,  Disclaimer. I received a free copy of this game to review. The following views are my own and not those of SNK Games.  TLDR Version. For a text game the writing is atrocious. Don't waste your money. For a short review follow the link.   http://retrogamingmagazine.com/2016/09/13/space-ranger-quest-good/

503710,Void,"I really enjoyed to play with Void. You are alone, in the space and you are doing everything to stay alive a few more minuts and for that, you need to catch oxygen and fuel.  It is an independant game, it is beautiful and the most important for some of you, it is not expensive at all.  I call Void a survival game in real condition."
503820,A Detective's Novel,"Right of the bat this game is complete garbage.Artstyle is terrible , bassicly no sound track , shity story line take from a cheap British show about detectives , Creator wanted to make main characters to look smart and deep thinking but all they get is full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cringe compilation . At game start you come to investigate crime scene , but then main character losses Cigs , and blames his parther starts to interogating him , imao its mentali retardet  Pros: Found none   Cons : whole game   Verdict : Its seems like someone just wanted to make ez money and publisched this trash : rating 1/10 bigest trash i played in a while"

503900,Candy Smash VR,"This best described as a Fruit Ninja VR knock-off that wants you to smash your TV/monitor/everything in your room that you didn't want to smash.   I got very irritated at how much they aim the candy to be launched OUTSIDE of your VR space. Seriously? ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I am not swinging for a piece of candy outside of my VR space and breaking all the stuff in my room.  That has turned it from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fruit Ninja VR knock-off to an unplayable POS game that I don't want in my library."
503960,Will of the Gods,"I've played games that have 2 times the content and half the price than this. You can only play with your Steam friends, the AI is a joke, and the selected areas (like which part of the menue or game area is selected) lags behind the mouse. It was potential, but at this stage the game should at best be a free browser game."
503980,Detective Hank and the Golden Sneeze,"  Wonderful game! I love the characters, the dialogue trees are great fun, and the art is beautiful as well. Awesome steampunk atmosphere that never takes itself too seriously. I also love the diversity (two of the main characters are gay, Hank has dark skin, etc.) and the super cute relationships between the characters."

504210,SHENZHEN I/O,"For all those who love to program micro processors, this game is a must. Back to basics for all of us who are on an advanced programming language, you will need to think how to do it on best and less expensive way without wasting code. reminds me back the old school times. Love this game."
504310,The Cooking Game,"Personally I feel completely let down, just bought this game five minutes ago, installed it... couldn't get to the actual game as the tutorial was broken. Suppose i'll have to try get a refund now. Such a shame as this looked like a very promising game."

504420,Malazard: The Master of Magic, Early Access Review
504490,The God's Chain,"There are no words to describe this. TOTAL CRAP! Steam please remove this game. Don’t be involved in selling this kind of thing. The game is unplayable. Story mode drops you into an open map with two aliens standing right behind you. After you die and spawn back in the same place eventually you kill them. That is as far as I can get because the game will crash or the gun won’t shoot or I just run around and can’t find any kind of objective. I tried pressing every button on my keyboard one by one and only found m for map and p for pause, when I hit exit from the pause menu it just closes the game."
504500,Hover Havoc,"it's a fun game but needs some improvement, especially on how the cars behave on your inputs. I didn't really feel I had full control of the cars and they're quite sensitive to turning.   I'd rate it 6/10 for now."

504620,"Grid Legion, Storm", Early Access Review
504630,Broomball,"Everyone is right on the money. Its pretty cool to fly around but at the moment is just a tutorial. Just get it. its free and like all VR games takes up so little space. At least keep an eye on it because if done right this could be a real winner. Maybe as fun as Battle Dome dare i say?  for the dev(s): Kinda strange that you only strafe left/right, forward/back, up/down but you have to physcially rotate to turn. I forsee this being an issue with tangling your cord. Some sort of rotate would be nice, whether its the trackpad or thru turning your head.. something. Other than that.. I think its pretty sweet.   oh ya -- the wind sounds are a nice touch as you're flying but when you stop moving and hover the sound goes away so quickly and its so 'empty' of sound its jarring"
504670,FARIA: Ghosts of the Stream,So idk how to reach out to the Dev...so I'll just leave this comment here and HOPEFULLY it reaches out to him or someone. Put a combat system into the game. Has anyone ever played Isaac and the golden sun? somethin' along those lines. I think this game would get popular.
504700,Blockships, Early Access Review
504750,Lew Pulsipher's Doomstar,"Not a bad game, but check out my video for my full thoughts.  Ok, so it's an interesting game for the first couple of characters in the campaign mode, but nearly all of the campaign feels like a tutorial and I never really felt like I was getting to an open game to play.  The strength in this game will probably be found in the multiplayer option where I assume you can play against other players rather than a set of computer opponents.  Although I would have to wonder if there is much progression within multiplayer, do you have a chance to earn prestige and build up your own fleet or have a selection of ships or additional support that you can take in to battle against an opponent or do both players have the same fleet to play with.  Either way I don't see the life of this game lasting too long as it just seems far too constrictive as a whole to be anything more than a game you come and spend about 5-10 minutes on to kill some time before you have something more interesting to do.    https://youtu.be/nH8qeJ38rRM "
504770,Slavistan,"OKAY, SO THIS IS A SLAV GAME... WHY DIDN'T YOU ADD CZECH REPUBLIC ??? CZECH REPUBLIC IS A SLAV COUNTRY, THIS GAME IS ABOUT SLAVS YET YOU DIDN'T ADD IT ????!!!!!! DO IT PLEASE !!! THEN I WILL RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANY COMRADE I KNOW !!!!"

504810,MXGP2 - The Official Motocross Videogame Compact,i dont know how it is because for some resean it wont run
504850,Castle Invasion: Throne Out,Still not finished playing. I was stuck on the troll boss for ages.
504880,Pixel Puzzles 2: RADical ROACH,"I quite like this type of games, find them entertaining and challenging.   Nice music and puzzles!   Don´t hesitate to try it out :),   I still find the mouse movement a bit slow/strange."
504980,Elves Adventure,  It's not easy to develop a game. I really appreciate the work of the developer but it ain't worth the full price. Buy it during the sale. It's got TRADING CARDS.
505070,Secrets of Me,"This VN actually had me laughing out loud several times. The set up is sort of odd and the heroine definitely insn't the usual type but I really liked her because of it. She's a lot bolder than the normal heroine you get from VN's. I do wish they wouldn't played up the stalking aspect a bit more but it's overall a very fun game. The only other thing is they made these guys' chins so damn pointy, but the overall design isn't too bad."
50510,Burn Zombie Burn,"This is an arcade style game. From what I played, it did well with what you would expect from an arcade game such as the action pacing, score oriented goal and power-ups on the map. As far as I can tell, it doesn't offer a storyline/plot, but that wouldn't be a big detraction from an arcade game. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the game because I was easily defeated frequently as a result of both the controls for xbox controler and mouse/keyboard. The controls are not as natural as I would like it and it is difficult to strafe fire and maneuver the character avoiding the enemies at the same time. Unexpectedly, the mouse/keyboard was easier than the gamepad, simply because the gamepad left stick moves the character, but the right stick does not control aim. As a result, I had to run forward into enemies shooting as my only move-and-shoot option with gamepad. However, the keyboard allows you to strafe-and-shoot as you would expect of a zombie defense game. Unfortunately, I couldn't move the character in any other direction than cardinal directions (North, S, E, W).  Simply put, i felt the controls were conflicting too much with my manueverability and being able to attack at the same time. I didn't feel interested in continuing or attempting to adapt to the controls because I was off put by them."
505140,Tribe Of Pok,"I can't really recommend this game.  I admit, I haven't played it for the 15 hours or whatever is the accepted standard around here for a review to be credible, but it is my opinion that first impressions are everything. And my first impression with this game is not good.  You control a tribe of stone-age villagers and take care of them, building shelter, collecting resources like wood, furs, and food, have them make tools and weapons to defend themselves from neighboring tribes and make their lives easier, etc.  The premise is good, where it falls apart is the execution. I'll confess, the whole time I've been playing the game, I was thinking to myself 'This is essentially Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld, but with far less variety in things to do.' And that's what this game is to me, more simplistic Dwarf Fortress, or Gnomoria, or Towns, or Stonehearth, or whatever village-simulator game you play.  The graphics for this game are, to put it simply, terrible. 2d sprites that bounce around the screen and bounce off each other to simulate fighting. And yes, I play Dwarf Fortress, which has NO graphics to speak of, but in my opinion that allows one's imagination to fill in the gaps, whereas this half-hearted attempt at graphics is depressing, everything is either a dull shade of green, or blue for water.  The UI is a lot like Gnomoria or Towns, which aren't very good as far as user interfaces go anyway, not much to say there except theres a lot of digging through menus to get to the thing you want to do.  The pace of the game is very slow, and villagers never seem to get around to doing something that you want done quickly. There doesn't seem to be a 'priority' system in place, and your food will sit on the ground rotting whilst your villagers shamble over and collect that 500th piece of long grass that just HAS to get collected now.  Combat in the game is very simple, make sure your villagers have stone spears (more menu digging to make sure of that!) and then enter combat mode, right click on target, and they go and kill it. Your villagers don't typically lose to animals, especially if they team up on them, but the animals seem wildly aggressive, how often do you think a giant sloth goes sprinting into your camp attempting to murder everyone? Yes, giant sloth, sprinting, you read that correctly.   The TL;DR version: save your money. Dwarf Fortress is way more in-depth, has graphics packs that look way better than this game, and is completely free. This is a knock-off that dares to charge 9 dollars for the 'privelege.'"
505170,Carmageddon: Max Damage,"Very mixed feelings about this title.  Graphically and performance-wise, Carmageddon Max Damage is OK. Its previous version, Carmageddon Reincarnation, definitely had some problems in that respect but Stainless did manage to resolve nearly all of them. I have not experienced any crashes or slowdowns with Max Damage at least. Note that the game has fairly heavy requirements so if you are close to the minimum CPU and/or memory, you will probably suffer and have to tone down your settings.  Other than that, the game pretty much 'feels' like Carmageddon 1 and 2. You race, you crash into opponents, you mow down pedestrians, pedestrians run/wheel away screaming. 'I was in teh war!' Oh yes, they are all there ...  If you already lost me, then I assume you never played one of the earlier titles. In that case, realise that Carmageddon is NOT A RACING GAME. This is a game about wreaking havoc and death &amp; destruction. If you are looking for a racing game, or a game with realistic vehicle behaviour, or stunning graphics or whatever, this is not the game for you. Carmageddon is all about pure and uncensored fun, nothing more, nothing less.  So is it a good title then, you ask? Is it better than Carmageddon 1 and 2? (I've chosen to ignore Carmageddon TDK because it blows.)  Well, yes and no. In a way it plays exactly like the earlier titles, but with improved graphics. That is a good thing. Except for the awful car handling, which is still exactly the same as I remember it 20 years ago (seriously of all the things you could change you kept the worst bit?). The developers included a few extras, like additional controllable powerups and a few more race modes, but nothing that warrants a new purchase. Get this title only if you want Carmageddon with shiny new graphics.  But ... there is always a but ... The game has severe balancing issues. The opponents in Carmageddon 1 and 2 were always cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s; able to zoom accross the map without care for the terrain and its pitfalls if you had no direct line of sight to them. That is still the case, but the game now even goes beyond that. The opponents are a lot more stronger than you: they can crash you in a few hits, while it takes you forever to whittle them down. They are almost always faster than you, but the second that you step into their car (after you stole it), that very same car drives like a dead snail even after you spent your scarce upgrade points on it. Opponents can reach checkpoints in nearly impossible to reach places easily when not visible, but the second you are near them they stumble and fumble to reach that same checkpoint.  Not that this makes the game a lot harder ... it is actually very difficult to lose an event against the AI players. Nevertheless, that cheap behaviour might have been acceptable 20 years ago when CPUs were not powerful enough to handle complex AI, but nowadays computers can handle AI calculations so there should be no need to aid the computer-driven cars that way.  The balancing issues suck a good portion of the fun out of this title: the obligatory (!) missions where you have to grab checkpoints to score points become exercises in frustration as opponents can crash you sometimes in a single hit, stealing your points, while you it takes you so long to steal a point of your own that other players meanwhile scored an additional 2 or 3 points. Similarly you see AI cars winning in races, despite the fact you saw them drive off a cliff or against a wall barely a minute earlier.  Summarizing, I cannot in good conscience recommend this title at full price. It has its fun moments, no doubt about that. And those who played the previous entries in the series will get their kick. But the balance problems and forced checkpoint-grabbing/racing minigames are so frustrating that you will never play this game for long stretches of time. Get this at a good discount."
505210,Neon Space 2,"  In my time as a reviewer and as a gamer, I don't feel as though I've found a game with such contempt for its audience. Neon Space 2 does not seem to care about entertaining the player, or offering an experience that's valuable and meaningful in other ways. It is lazy, careless, broken, tiresome, and entirely without reason to exist.   And that's a shame. It didn't have to be those things.  Pros  +Good soundtrack  Cons  -Barebones gameplay -Sloppy controls -Cheap sense of difficulty -Lack of payoff  My full review can be found here:  http://www.keengamer.com/article/13735_neon-space-2-review "
505220,King of Spin VR, Early Access Review
505400,Diamond Joyce and the Secrets of Crystal Cave,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
505660,The Crystal Nebula,"This game is absolutly incredible. I rarely write a review but this one really deserves it. Its a classic style shooter and runs flawlessly and glitch free in VR on my Vive with a i7600K, 32 gig ram / NVidia 980ti. First of all at $1.99 its a steal. You have your ship in one hand and a crystal collector which converts to a shield when it is powered up. Your enemies are drones that shoot at you and you shoot asteriods of various sizes to get the crystals as well as getting them from the drones and other enemies. You go through waves and between the shooting you go through narrow areas that completey surround you and the immersive feeling is so intense and polished. It has great graphics with an amazing mezmorizing soundtract that adds so much to the game. Music is such a huge part of any VR experence and there are SO many devolopers that have great sounding music when your viewing their videos at the Steam store and you buy the game and theres little or nothing. Now the very slight negative. The game is very hard and just to get to the 3rd or 4th wave is a huge acomplishment which is about 8 minutes long. You only have one life and when your ship gets too many hits (15 to be percise) thats it...'GAME OVER'. If it was a little less difficult, maybe 3 lives and more waves and a few different enviorments, I would easily pay $10-15 dollars for it. At $1.99, there is absolutely no excuse to not get this game, I promise.....you will NOT regret it!"
505680,Glaive,Yet another wave shooter but with a new-ish formula and a creepy setting. It's fun especially if you were a Krull fan.
505700,Anyland,"Amazing game, but has the WORST building system possible and crashes frequently, causing you to loose all your unsaved work. Consider this an early access game, that is fun when it works but still needs major improvement."
505750,Trimmer Tycoon,It is an addicting and hard game that is fun to waste your time with and you will keep saying just 1 more minute. This is a great underrated game. 7 /10
506140,Shop Heroes,Game foe ppl that have no life
506150,Dragon Bros, Early Access Review
50620,Darksiders,"Plays very similar to Zelda, just with a darker theme, so if you're a fan of Ocarina of Time, or Twilight Princess, you'll probably enjoy this game. Tight controls, good puzzles, and lots of horse riding, sword swinging fun.  Although the developer has releashed a remaster of this game, i would still purchase the original version until certain issues are addressed. Having played both, and can certainly agree that the remaster looks better, the constant stuttering and audio sync issues, especially during cutscenes, was enough to drive me to uninstall and go back to playing the original. Once these issues are fixed, then the remaster might be worth it, but not yet."
506280,My Lil' Donut,"A weird little experience. Couldn't quite figure out exactly what to do other than manipulate the donut to some degree for a couple minutes.  It's really really basic, but even for a free app I have to give it just 4 DOHs out of 9, needs a little more work :^/"
506470,Quip Anomaly,It's a good game for few hours of fun.
506500,Party Panic, Early Access Review
506550,RollerForce,"I got a little sick on this one, and aiming a slow projectile from a moving coaster is kinda difficult. It's worth the money though - it's an inexpensive ride/game that works if you can stomach it.  Not my favorite VR experience but it's fun, and inexpensive."
506590,Sky Valley,"I only ended up with this game because it was apparently part of a bundle that included other games I actually wanted. I have no interest in supporting asset flippers and people who take the work of others and pose it as their own, particularly those trying to gain profit from it.  I don't even like that I had to run the game for at least 5 minutes before it would allow me to post a review.  Steam needs better curation than just random people voting on Greenlight."
506610,Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location,"This game breaks away from the linear FNAF formula to focus on a more campaign-like horror game, this design choice is much appriciated as the classic 'survive trapped in a room' gameplay was starting to get less interesting. This is clearly the most creative FNAF out of the entire series and I think that is it's best attribute. The gameplay is still quite similar to the last 4, but this time you have an array of different things to do in different rooms and only one of the rooms is survival related. To any fans who wantted the classic gameplay, there is the custom night, which is unlocked by beating the unfairly difficult fake ending and by completing the tedious minigame. The custom night is like the classic FNAF formula, but each character has their own (completely different) behaviour, which does add to the replayability. The custom night also adds on some lore to the game. Despite all this, the game still has strange problems like you not actually being able to edit the animatronics in the custom night and a lack of an options menu. If you are a fan of FNAF, you'll enjoy this game, if you hate FNAF, you won't, if you want to try out a horror game, give this a go, this is clearly the best one since the first and it's clear that Scott Cawthon is starting to head back in the right direction."
506670,ORBITAL,Very good game: 1)Nice soundtruck 2)Very simple 3)Funny game  It would be better if: 1)More powers 2)Reduce cooldowns 3)Add levels
506730,Dinosaur Forest,   Early Access Review
506830,Goo Saga - HD Edition,Wobbly controls and somehow repetitive and boring without immersion or funny/exciting story. Feels like an assembly line production without soul and love. Deniable. There are way better platformers.
506960,Pong Champion VR, Early Access Review
507050,DOGOS,"The camera controls are awful ,it's unplayabple ..  There no settings for it either.."
507080,Baseball Mogul Diamond,Fun at first. Kinda has a cheating feel to it. A.I gets double plays 90% of the time while user controlled teams might get 1 double play every 1-2 games regardless of how well you play the stradegy. Not to mention teams feel over/underpowered. I can recommend this game overall but it doesn't feel like it's well layed out.
507120,The Superfluous,   Early Access Review
507140,Tesla's Tower: The Wardenclyffe Mystery,That was a good bit of fun. Entirely worthy for a different sort of pace. Best $2.50 value i've come across on steam.
507210,The Wire,"This is brilliant. Great graphics, great game play. I can't understand why people don't like this. It is what it says, like the old wire games you played when you were a kid. You touch the edge, you bomb out. There is nothing else like this game in the market place. Absolutely brilliant, you MUST give it ago. Don't get frustrated with the game because you hit the edge, thats your hand eye coordination, thats the whole point. Great for if friends come around... 10/10."
507380,Black Sand Drift,"The Game looks like it's made in paint, also the music is very bad and obnoxious. If it had any new cool mechanics it would redeem it self, but it doesn't."
507390,Gone In November,The worst game in the world!
507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,  It's a fantastic RTS game! Perfect! It would be better if there’s a Chinese language pack.
508170,BlackSmith HIT,well i mean for the $0.99 cents its alright. super minimalistic only two buttons to play but other than that.....no good.  possibly would give it a second chance if it had more than one gamemode because multiplayer does not count. all multiplayer is is the same game but head to head with another player. in a future update i might get it again but oter than that dont waste 99 cents

508230,Anime Studio Simulator,"Interesting design and idea, but lack of voices in a visual novel game made me supaaa bored"
508260,Treasure of a Blizzard,Boring
508290,$1 Ride,"--- ---  I really don't have anything to add what many others have already said: This game indeed is a very imcomplete alongside far too restrictive for it is own good (not to also mention very inconsistent with its rules (E.G. the hit-box of the player-character sometimes hit two object but 9/10 times there is zero-possibilities to get two pick-ups).  Missed the minimum of 'medium boost' two rows in a row? Game over. Hit a singular slow-down-object? Game Over.  So for the most part it indeed is a game in which you apparently are meant to dodge all the picj-ups aside the min. medium-speed-boosts.  ---  So, is there anything positive for me to say about his game?  At least they directed me to this 'Eric Matyas'-dude, who indeed makes good music (or at least I am able to find good music on the pages the name leadds to).  Hopefully I can find the music outside the game (which was decent), mainly because it is in one of those 'encrypted'-forms here.  --- --- ---"
508390,Scrap Garden - The Day Before,"I want to like this game but right now its just too unpolished.  The good things: It's cute! Enemies arent that hard to kill. The puzzle parts arent hard to figure out. The general atmosphere in the game is fun.   The bad parts: Having to restart the level when you die. Losing your Spares when you die. Also when i have 90 Spares and i need 50 to fix something i expect it takes away 50 and letting me continue with my remaining 40, instead it takes all the scrap you have leaving you with 0 and that really confused me. Achievements dont make sense. Theres lag occuring when you break boxes. Later levels are very short.   Fixing these things would hugely improve this game but how it is right now i give it a 4/10"
508540,Haeven,"Haven- is quite enticing game where we have to investigate the mind. Present: drawn, but attractive graphics, good soundtrack, interesting gameplay and turn-based battles. It should also be noted - Attractive graphics - Good soundtrack - I wonder and original gameplay - Turn-based battles - Price Take not regret "

508820,Won't You Be My Laser?,"Controls feels a little too loose. Laser collision detection doesn't always work so you die once in a while when you shouldn't. The game speed seems a little off. But mostly, it just wasn't any fun. But it has trading cards and it drops them. (1/5 stars, buy it for trading cards)."
508990,Handsome Mr. Frog,"It's a less fun Super Mario, the one where enemies come from pipes near the top of the screen. Because the controlls aren't fluid and the levels are designed poorly the optimum strategy is to sit in one place and spam the 'x' button. Also, Super Mario was good because you had to voluntarily be in harm's way in order to hit the enemies, whereas this game allows you to stay completely safe while killing things."

509110,Spikit,"This game will keep you wanting to play it over and over again.  Really cool game I give it 9/10 just because there are a few things that they can still improve on. 1- More music options  2- Perks or upgrades  3- Co-op or multiplayer  4- Other stages or levels  Dont get tempted to try to grab the popup boxes too much,  its always a distraction leading to death. "
509170,VRNinja,  So this game can be played without the wands which in its self is kinda awesome but you basically have to not get killed. Sometimes it can be easy... others not so much. Espically when i bomb falls under your ♥♥♥!   Anyway if you want to have a quick look then check this 1st look out. kinda just shows how the game works and all that jazz :)    https://youtu.be/qfJTKUKo8eI

50920,Hidden Expedition Amazon ,"Wife and I both loved this game within the series. The puzzle are very challenging, graphics was great. Game play we even better"
509210,Clockwork,"Controls are clunky. Level design is needlessly painful. I found 3 bugs in my first 2 minutes.  They introduce the controls by saying things like 'use the Button6 button to...' (I have an Xbox 360 controller. I only found 'Button6' by trying every single button until one of them did something.)  The first half-hour was intriguing, but too tedious for me to want to continue."
509220,Save Jesus,"If this was a free flash game I'd tell you that it great and that you should play it. However this is not a free flash game. While it is quite fun and has an interesting concept, it doesn't have much else going for it. Only buy this game if you can get it for less than a 1$."
509230,Erusal,"  At first I was very impressed by the size of Marias pennis but then I notice the bumps on the head. I was also very disappointed that I spent a whopping $1.99 on such a master piece.

509570,In Celebration of Violence, Early Access Review
50960,Mystery Case Files: Huntsville ,"My second MCF Game that I owned, I love the MCF Series, (I was shocked that they were on Steam) I thought that this one was the hardest even when I was a kid its was impossible for me I got most of them but lost most of them, so I rebought them on Steam and hoping that Big Fish Games will releash all of MCF games on Steam later next year. (PLEASE DO IT BIG FISH!) I recommended this game if you're a big fan of the MCF Series or if you're a big fan of Hidden Object games. (Like me)"
509600,BattleTime,Old often used gameplay mechanic Not very polished Plays like a mobile game I don't recommend it
50970,Mystery Case Files: Madame Fate ,"A very whimsical, yet fun, hidden object game. Best in short bursts, and great for winding down or for mindless fun."
509770,PostCollapse, Early Access Review
50980,Mystery Case Files: PrimeSuspects ,"*Happiness Sigh* My first MCF game that I ever got as a kid, (and played the demo on  Pogo.com)  I love this game (but not my all time favorite) I really love this game but, I also HATED this one as well, why because of the third crime computer puzzle is a crossword puzzle and when I was little its was hard because I didn't know how to spell and know what words they are, But this game is also fantastic by the, places you can explore and atmosphere is beautiful, and the soundtrack... well... creepy... (Turn the music volume down, to creepy) But still I love this game."
509840,El Ninja (Beta),"Block style platformer, like a watered down Super Meat Boy. The game does offer unique controls in how you fling El Ninja around the screen. You have a set amount of moves to kill the bad ninjas and rescue your ninja girlfriend. You can collect throwing stars to give you additional moves. The graphics and music are both very basic, though hearing your charcter make ninja noises ('ha-ya!') and going into slow mo before your next strike is pretty cool."
509860,Baezult,"This is not a good game. The one bit of music that there is, is repetative and boring. The rest of the game is lacking in any music. The artstyle is boring and uninspired and the puzzles are either really easy or annoyingly hard. This game is free so give it a try, but I still rate it as a bad game."
50990,Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst ,My thrid favorite MCF game TBH I wasn't a fan while replaying it (idk why?) but I did enjoyed when I was a kid and this was my first MCF game that I ever beatend while I was young (maybe thats why?) but I recommend this game if you're a fan of the MCF series and creepy atmosphere games (and music)
509930,NightmareZ,This is a very good 2d-retro game i played it in my friend and i loved it and i say why not to buy it The gameplay is good and the soundtrack little loud but good.The grafics are simple and the design is god i think you should buy it if you like platform game. For this price is a very good game . :)
509960,Pinga Ponga,Very basic but pretty fun game if you have a friend to play with
51000,Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst ,Good game if you like to solve puzzles.
510050,You Have 10 Seconds,"As much as i would like to like this game, i simply cannot. The game may seem easy but the bits of lag hear and there along with poor response to you clicking the arrow key. It makes this game nearly impossible, usually i like a challenge but not one that can break my keys for how hard i have to push them."
510070,Shiperoids,"I’m Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss, and in 23 years I’ve learned one thing. You never know what is gonna come through that door.  On this episode of Pawn Stars I got an original contract that the who signed to perform at Woodstock. The who is one of the biggest bands of all time. That's a pretty important piece of memorabilia. What are you trying to get out of it? So what have we got here? Old faithful high-speed washing machine. Looks real high-speed. The faster you crank it, the faster it goes. Could you imagine bringing this thing home to mom, telling her, 'this is what you're doing laundry with now'? She'd punch me in the face. I've got a set of antique pistols. This a dueling set. They could be worth some serious money. They look 98% real to me, except for one thing I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, big hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years, you never know what is gonna come through that door. [upbeat bluesy guitar music] What can I help you with, man? I have a flask, not just any flask. This one opens up at the bottom. There was a note in here. You have a message in a bottle. Yes, I do. Awesome. I decided to come to the pawn shop today to sell my civil war flask. I was cleaning out my grandfather's basement he passed away and I came across it in a box, and I saw the note in it, and then I figured, you know, it was worth something. I just lost my job and need the money. I figured a couple hundred bucks would help me out. So when did you write the note? I didn't write that. Yeah, right. Okay, it says, 'silver whiskey flask 'carried by David Alexander Shepherd '1823 to 1883 'before, during, and after the civil war 'in which he was entrusted with the funds 'of two confederate banks 'with the instructions to stay out of the way of the Yankees. ' Well, there's a whole little story along with him. I mean, the neat thing was, I mean, if you were a spy or something like that, I mean, unless someone looked at this thing really closely, they wouldn't have noticed. This flask is awesome. It's definitely silver and very high-quality. It's the type of item that wouldn't sit around long on the shelves of my store. I'm interested, because the only thing better than making money is making money fast. Smells like stagnant water in there. [Laughter] All right. You can just tell by the hallmarks, it's old. Those are English hallmarks, and it says 'd. A. Shepherd' right across the front of it. The great thing is, it's in beautiful shape. So what do you want to do? You want to pawn it or sell it? I want to sell it. Okay, and how much do you want for it? I don't know. I don't what something like this is worth. I mean, this thing is from the 1850s or the 1840s. All right. How about $800? Um, it's not too far off. I was thinking more in the neighborhood of $500. $650, you have a deal. [Sighs] I'll tell you what, I'll do 600 bucks. Yeah, I think it's a fair price. All right. Okay? All right, chum, can you go write him up? Sure. I'm psyched to get this flask. You can tell by the way it's made, it's definitely old, but I keep thinking about that note, and if there's any way to validate the story, I can probably get a few hundred more bucks for it, so I'm gonna call in my buddy and see if he can authenticate it for me. [Cash register dings] [Bluesy guitar music] Ã Ã hey, how's it going, man? Hey, what's going on? What do we got? I got an original contract that the who signed to perform at Woodstock, the greatest band of all time. Don't you hope you die before you get old? Stone cold. [Laughter] I came to the pawn shop today to sell my 1969 contract for the who to perform at the Woodstock festival. The who is the greatest band, baba o'Riley, behind blue eyes. It's a piece of rock history. Who wouldn't want it? 'New action ltd. Furnishing the services of the who with Woodstock ventures inc. ' And it's signed by Michael lang himself. He did not only the '69. He did the '94. He did the 25-year anniversary. It's the real deal. This is pretty cool, man. The who was one of the biggest bands of all time, and if that's legit, that's a pretty important piece of memorabilia right there. This is the contract the band signed before playing in Woodstock. I mean, contracts like this could sell for big numbers, and it's not every day that something like this just walks through the door. Where'd you get it? My mom likes to go to yard sales, so while we were at one of the places, I was just looking around, and they had a couple albums, and the who's my favorite band, and I opened the album, and it was there. One of the biggest bands in the world at the time only got paid $12,500 to play one of the biggest shows of all time. Yeah, well, $12,500 back then was a lot of money, Corey. I made about $200 a month in the Navy at that time. What do you want to do with it? I want to sell it, because I really want to buy a new car. What are you trying to get out of it, son? I was looking for 5 grand. Well, you can keep looking. It looks real, except paperwork has been forged in the past. The signatures are all legit. I'm gonna have to have somebody take a look at it. It's gonna have to be sent off to a few different documentation companies. It's not it's not something as easy as just, 'oh, here's 5 grand,' and you walk out the door, and I take this. I mean, it's how about an offer? I'll make you an offer, but it's gonna be 100 bucks, man. I mean, for 100 bucks, I might as well keep it. Yeah, well, that's your privilege. Can you do $1,500? No, we're not even on the same planet. I really think the total value here is somewhere around $1,000. And after I get it certified, all that stuff, I mean, I'm putting some pretty decent money into it. I'll give you 200 bucks for it, man, and that's only because I think my father will like it. Top-of-the-line, Corey. All right. All right, man, deal. Let's go do some paperwork, my friend. The who is one of the biggest bands of the '60s and '70s, and my dad really loves them, and if this thing's legit, it could be worth some serious money. [Upbeat bluesy guitar music] Ã Ã a few days ago, I got a call from a guy wanting to sell me his antique hand-crank washing machine, so me and Corey are on our way to his place to check it out. So what have we got here? An old faithful high-speed washing machine. Yeah, it looks real high-speed. It is. The faster you crank it, the faster it goes. This is cool. I mean, you could lose weight and do your laundry at the same time. I called the guys at the pawn shop to come out to my house to see if they were interested in buying my antique washing machine. I'm a collector of certain antique pieces, but they have to be really kind of strange and unique. But I need some room. I have too many pieces in my house. So what do you know about it? The construction looks like it's all pine, all original, patent date on it of 1892 and 1898. There was two different patents on it. It has the original handle, which comes out, surprising that it hasn't been lost, but it has all the original stenciling. Everything is all-original, flywheel, gears. So how does this thing work? If you open this up, this is where you put your clothes in. You fill it with water and put your detergent in there, and you would close it and just crank it, a high-speed washer. The faster you go, the higher the speed. [Laughs] It cranks real easy now. I can imagine it full of water and clothes. Could you imagine just bringing this thing home to mom and just telling her, 'this is what you're doing laundry with now'? She'd punch me in the face. [Laughter] Believe it or not, this was a time-saver and a luxury. These types of machines were really popular up until the late 1800s,"

510650,Eventide 2: The Sorcerers Mirror,"I was pleasantly surprised by this game. My library shows something like 15 Artifex Mundi HOGs, so I think there's some experience there. It feels like this game was crafted with more care than others. Towards the end it felt a bit rushed, but that is common.  The puzzles were (very slightly) harder (especially early in game) than in previous Artfex Mundi releases, and I really hope they find a way to offer harder puzzles for people who want them.  The idea that your choices affect your future is a common desire among these games. To make that happen, a great deal of content has to be created that will often never be seen. That is a roadblock. But it was great to see the attempt at it.  It was nice that we were given a 'moral' choice several times through the game, but the actual result wasn't significantly different. From a mechanics standpoint, it was a difference between how many tired/old/simple puzzles you had to play at the end to beat the boss. Understood... everyone should be able to complete the game, but :(  Maybe, instead of sticks, offer carrots to those who choose to attempt the hard puzzles?  However, from a story standpoint, there were good differences. Who had you befriended? Who had you harmed? Those choices come back in the story.  The publisher did add extra content for those who were willing to search for it, and that is good. "

It is a great game to have younger VR users squirt water at bugs. the graphics are nice and I havent seen any bugs (not the insect kind) or issues. And for you competitive people there is a ranking score board. Yes, it is mindless and takes no skill, but it is fun just like any VR game should be. If you had options to pick and upgrade guns i could see a higher replayability. Overall I think it should be in everyones VR library."

Whilst the graphics are pleasing, some of the puzzle pieces don't quite match up to where they need to go due to a large gold outline around each piece which can be somewhat confusing.

511600,Space Jones VR,"Kind of janky. Returning it. didnt even get to the point of flying because it requires getting stars or something to build it for your ship. So I sat there for 30 minutes trying to get used to the controls, but then got bored by it. Better shooters out there like Space Pirate trainer, and it restricts you from flying immediately. And not worth trying to play to get it."
511670,Marwin and The Evolution Stone,"Even for the low price, I can't really recommend this game. There's a good idea for a game here, but the execution is very poor, leading any success to feel far more like luck than actual skill. I quit after getting to Sandland 1, because there was just a small margin of error, but your control over your character has a huge margin of error. There's just not enough control, and there's only a small window where you even HAVE some semblance of control over your character. Additionally, the physics are a bit wonky, where you can shoot the monkey towards a wall, but when he hits the wall, he doesn't bounce off it, just stays hung up against it. The english translation isn't very good, if that bothers you. I typically find it amusing, and I do here, but it isn't very good. All in all, while I'm idling it for the last few cards, it's probably not worth the small cost or download space."
511690,Duck Force,"There's so much to like about this game. Graphics and sound effects are good but i got really queasy with the 3rd person perspective - you're directly behind the little duck as you fly and that means clipping through terrain at chest height when your duck is near ground level. Yes, you can fly the duck 'remotely' but that's nowhere near as immersive.   There's nothing else i can criticize about this game and it's obviously not an issue for other reviewers but i refunded because of that issue alone."
511720,MAGIX Video deluxe 2017 Plus Steam Edition,i got this for its screen capture ability ( i used to have magix pro 13 or something like that) but this one refuses to to work with my audio that isnt a mic so i got a refund.
511740,Gal*Gun: Double Peace,"To be honest I expected this to be funnier. Maybe I'm getting too old for this.  I found this game to be more entertaining than Senran Kagura, and less entertaining than Akiba's Trip.  The premise sounds much more hilarious when you read it than it is during the gameplay. However, the game has surprising amount of depth in it, in the sense that there are a LOT of small things you could unlock, fill, 'collect', etc. You could probably kill at least a month if not more hunting them all.  Every single girl (I think there's roughly 100 characters in the game) in the game has unique character, short biography, may or may not occasionally give out an optional 'quest' (those show up in cellphone between levels), you can get an ending with any of them, and they are all voiced. Of course, only main heroines get proper full ending with unique song/artwork, but every char has few voiced lines to say in ending squence. So, ridiculous amount of work went into making the characters. You can also spent large amount of time going hunting for every hidden item and secret in the game.  However, the difficulty is quite low (with mouse you probably won't have any trouble beating the game on maximum difficulty), locations are occasionally reused - meaning you have same background level, but you go through it in different way, hidden items are in different locations, and different characters attack you.  The game also has strange DLC policy, which may or may not be an expression of japanese humor. I think the day where a japanese game is released with clothing editor (and not with thousand costume dlcs), the hell will freeze over.  I've also experienced occasional crashes. Pausing the game and alt-tabbing it crashes it fairly reliably, those crashes happened two or three times between levels. Thankfully, levels are short.  Another thing that is worth keeping in mind, that there are a lot of voice lines without subtitles. Girls say interesting thing, but unless you have at least very basic understanding of japanese (meaning you can roughly understand 20..50% by ear), you'll miss them out. There's nothing critical, and and 'VN-style' dialogue is fully translated (meaning you have text you can read), but in few situations in minigames characters give you hints with voice about what you need to do next, and those voice lines have no subtitles.  Bottom line: Quite a bit of depth in it, not very difficult, worth checking out, but if you want something hilarious, Akiba's trip might be a better choice."

Great design, great visuals A must buy. the only thing I will say is that you can't swap ball colours like in the original that I can see and the grey/grey and the blue/grey are a bit too close and I keep getting them mixed up. Butr apart from that AMAZING !!!"
512220,Trickster VR, Early Access Review
512230,Sally's Law,"This is a fairly basic puzzle platformer, but you're here because this is one of those 'games as art' games. The story intertwined with the mechanics weave an emotional tale. Definitely worth the hour or two it lasted."
512240,Duckpocalypse,Cheaper than a burger and much more tasty... Just wish I could shoot that fricking dog.
512300,Unbox,"When loading paradise isles on low settings, there is invalid texture coordinance."
512430,Make America Great Again,"This game is great! Easy and quick to understand! The great man, the one and only, aka Big D, aka supreme leader, President Donald theDon Trump would approve.   13/14 Illegal borderjumpers would play again.  #Trump4Pres #HesWithUs"
512470,The Pirate: Caribbean Hunt,"There is a lot of negative reviews about this game which is quite obvious as its free. The first point everybody usually states is that it has micro transactions, how else are the devs supposed to make money then? You work your way up to bigger and better ships slowly if you dont buy anything or maybe you get lucky and tale down a large ship.  pros -fun gameplay  -if gameplay is to slow fast foward button increases speed -you have multiple options of your playstyle (one big ship or many sloops) -online mode  cons -multiplayer matches are rare  - is SLIGHLTY pay to play (as in you can get better ships for anywhere between (1.39$-6.00$ canadian) "
512550,Cursed West,"Kane oh Kane; where art thou.  So its been 30 years since I last played Kane, but I still remember it clearly. The laptop I am on is about the same size as the computer I used back in 1986. And The only real differance is that the tape/band station for inputing the game program into the computer is gone and replace by an internet connection.  This game is not Kane but really not that far from, but will I remember this game in 30 years....nah.  Its a fun game non the less that gives one something to do for awhile.  So is it worth 3Euros? Nope,  Its real value with all these steam sales and such? Around 0.5E is a good value for this title since it has Achivements and Trading cards to strive for."
512630,VR Gallery,Teleport feature is OK but we must be able to rotate on the spot - as implemented in AltSpace VR. This feature is a MUST.
512640,Final Quest,"♥♥♥♥ of crap game and graphics, why why are they still making 2d games in 2016? please someone help"
512710,Tesla VR,Fun and informative VR experience. Should definitely try this VR experience if you own a HTC Vive.
512740,Flat Path,"Well great simple game, easy achivement, though it's a bit boring"
512770,IACTURA,"  Just remembered me old atari times.Nothing new to game scene, but still funny :D 7/10"
512790,Quern - Undying Thoughts,Recommended for fans of puzzle games. This game provides solid puzzle design and a decent story
513000,Kuboom, I love this game so much    Pros
513200,EDMtv VR,"just one thing to say_worst s**t ever,dont use this c**p.what have they thinking,can allmost see the videos,its sooo bad.hope steam remove this THING."
513210,Rescue Bear Operation, Early Access Review
513230,The Underground Man,"This game... it legit just wastes your time. The video is cut down from 58 minutes of gameplay, and I cut out the least interesting bits. THe video is still boring, mind you. Look for yourself.   HERE'S A VIDEO SHOWING ITS GAMEPLAY "
513260,Green Moon 2,"This game is absolutely beautiful! Someone put a lot of thoughtfulness into it. The locations, the sights and the sounds, the charm of it, [there is voice acting], it is splendid. It is also satisfyingly difficult and complex, especially if you are new to the genre, as I was, but probably even if you've played a HOG before.   I didn't play GM1, but I can tell you that this is not the problematic game that the first one apparently was. I did have to skip two of the minigames, after trying them for a while. The first one happened early on and I was dismayed by that. Maybe it was me and someone else will be able to do the asteroid minigame (though it was very cool to look at and try). The rest of the minigames were interesting and I was able to do them. I decided to move past that minor annoyance, and I am not disappointed with how the game played out. It was stunning and very fun. I hope there will be a Green Moon 3 !!"
513320,ALICE VR,"Simply can't play the game nor can't get a refund, so it's money down the trash on my end.  The game doesn't recognize the trigger of my HTC controller (which works like a charm in all other games and apps). I reported this early on and out of goodwill I waited for the update to fix it because I genuinly wanted to try the game.  When the update came out it didn't fix the issue. What I did lose because of this mistake was my 2-week refund period.  **UPDATE:**  the developers offered their help to find the issue. I haven't taken on that offer because I don't want to waste more time on this."
513340,Through Abandoned: The Forest,"I was a fan of the first game and the sequel did not disappoint! This game, much like the first one, is cheap, has a nice art style and good music. It also has good, smooth gameplay. The puzzles in this game are a good difficulty where it's not too difficult [albeit a tiny bit frustrating from time to time] but it's not too simple.    TL;DR   Intriguing story and gameplay. Highly reccomend this series to people!"
513360,Mu Cartographer,If you want something different from all the rest and something toylike. This is something you want.  It's basicly playing with a toddler thats oddly specific.  And at its core it works like this. You start with some things to discover that give you more things to discover.
513420,VR Escape the space station,"Poor.  Grabbing stuff doesn't feel right. Anti-gravity is incredibly annoying instead of super cool. There is no place you can put things so they stop floating around. If you try and put stuff in a container they'll repeatedly smash into the lid or opening until it opens and they fly out again. It's easy to accidentally send your stuff flying and then you have to wait for them to come back. There is no inventory system either.  The actual puzzles are poor. The codes are done in such a way that it's easy to think you need a longer or shorter code than you need. For example, in the first room the code is 6 digits long but it'll only display 5 and then error out, making you think you need a 5 digit code. Actually, the 6th number confirms the code so you need a 6 digit code. The buttons on them are finicky and it's easy to accidentally press too many. You can't backspace so you need to try the entire thing in again from scratch.  There are no clues or indicators of how to solve a puzzle. You're expected to look at something and just understand how it works. Normally games would teach you how a mechanic works but this game takes you to the final stage of a puzzle and just hopes you get it. The final code you have to enter to win is ridiculous, with zero indication of how you're supposed to arrive there. The switches in the final room are trial and error.  This game was terrible. Look at Abode or even VR: Vacate the Room for better examples of how to do a VR escape room experience."
513440,Path of War,This game is about as exciting as watching paint dry.
513450,Drop Alive,"Drop Alive, what about it?  I liked this game, it was cute, it was was fun, it was challenging and in my opinion I think you should give it a try. When I played this game, I only played it for achievements, but now I am actually playing this game for both achievements and fun. Now I do have to say, that this game can be rage inducing at times but if you like a good challenge and a nice platformer, why not play Drop Alive? Now I really like this game and I think you would enjoy this game as well.   Now I should have mentioned that this game has a lot of cheap deaths and a lot of areas you will cringe in pain. Anyways, I think this game deserves an 8/10"
513510,Intralism,"Picked it up for a couple bucks. I'm a huge fan / rather good at DDR (Stepmania) and games like Superhexagon so it seemed like something I'd be into.  It's... fine. Not really good or bad, and having to choose an up or down vote is hard in itself. Being under development I can only assume it'll get better.  The core game loop needs some pizzaz or something. I get that the idea is to make a challenging fail condition but unlike Super Hexagon, there's really no sense of progress or trying to beat yourself - there's no 'just one more game!' aspect that converts frustration into wanting to play more, so what you're left with is just that frustration (or more likely ambivalence) until you quit the song with a shrug.  At a mechanical level, and maybe this was by design, multiples of the same 'note' direction get stacked and lost visually so maybe there's actually three beats in there but you only hit it twice and then one goes through as a srtike against you. What it really means is that you can be feeling totally good about your run and then just sort of fail, seemingly at random.  Part two of this is that the 'wrong note' screen shake shudder is seemingly identical to the 'right note' one, so there's no really solid feedback for what you are or aren't doing right / wrong. In a game that's going to make you repeat things constantly in order to evolve and learn your way through them, it's not super great at demonstrating or teaching you those skills.  EDIT: this part 3 sentence complained about the vagueness of where you're supposed to hit the notes but an update added a crosshair hitbox thing so that's infinitely better. Thanks!"
513560,Hunger Dungeon,"You can't be serious if you are designing a game in UNITY. A game made out of pixel art shouldn't be laggy but you somehow managed to make it lagg! Maybe it isn't even lagg, the game is just not smooth at all. The game has a great concept but it isn't going to get anywhere for as long as you use UNITY."
513570,Wooden House,"The English is atrocious, but the sound design is even worse. I finished it in 32 minutes. Meh."
513580,Miaou Moon,"Farting cat in space... The controls and gameplay smell the same. Thanks, no."
513590,So Many Cubes, Early Access Review
513610,Madrobot X,"This is quite possibly the worst game I've ever played on Steam. I could make this in Clickteam Fusion in about an hour. That's not a humblebrag- it's a testament to how rudimentary this game is. I can't tell if the controls or mechanics are at fault, but this game's only diffulty is in how hard it is to move as intended. I didn't expect much from that price tag, but I expected more from a greenlit item."
513620,SkyTime,This is the most stupid game ever!!!
513760,3dSunshine, Early Access Review
513770,Click Space Miner,"The game doesn't save and just crashes at some point. After that happens, you have to start all over again. This game isn't even worth playing if you have an auto clicker. I would ask steam for a refund, but I only paid $0.49 for the game. If you want a cheap game to inflate your library number, this is the game for you."
513780,Turbo Pug DX,Pug go fast. Pug have fun. Very satisfied with my purchase. 10/10 would pug again.
513790,DEADLOCK, Early Access Review
513810,Arkham Nightmares,1. the ♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack ♥♥♥♥♥ suck  2. do not have instruction 3. when you recording keep showing u some ♥♥♥♥♥ stupid blur thing  get one now before this game become free to play :)  https://youtu.be/LykCF_W30bQ  
513820,LUXIS,  LUXIS is a 3D physics-based action puzzler. I'm a big fan of Neon Space and this is like a next-generation deluxe version of it.   Gameplay
513930,J.U.R : Japan Underground Racing,wow not worth the 5 bucks but i see how much work has went into coding the game ui etc..... still needs a ton of work this is beta at best lacking content such as cars dyno a way to tune the parts you just bought etc.... the driving is bad racing is worse there is a civic its an FF car and the game is based around drifting in every race so this does not work well while driving the car yet the other cars are FR they do better in the race as you would guess but still the drift factor is way to high every turn at nothing it goes sideways!!!!! and not cuz tha hp lolz     this could be a great game
513960,Galactic Fighters, Early Access Review
513980,Oh No! Bugs!,  Better than No Man's Sky.
513990,Happy Empire,OMG! Don't under ANY circumstances buy this game. Boring just got a whole new definition.
514010,Football Mogul 15,THis game is worth 4 bucks maybe.
514050,Uprising 2: Lead and Destroy,"Finally, this great game did return from the dead.   If you are a fan of Battlezone , try this.   You have great game about a powerful Hover Tank, fight on different planets and RTS elements like teleport in supporting troops and take outposts."
514090,Beautiful Japanese Scenery - Animated Jigsaws,"If you like puzzles, you'll like it. Cons:  The music is repetitive. You can switch between 3 tracks in the options, but quickly just turn it off and turn on your own music. There's not enough space to lay out all the pieces to look at them all at once for the 300+ piece puzzles. This makes it more difficult &amp; time consuming. I still recommend it."
514160,18 Wheels of Steel: Across America,Great game !
514220,Super GunWorld 2,this game has great dev(s)? that listen to player input a lot  the game itself needs some fixes but it is great for a 1 man dev team
514240,ALONE?, Early Access Review
514290,Factory Engineer, Early Access Review
514310,SENRAN KAGURA Bon Appetit!,"Seems like a nice game, but I do dislike it that my Steam Controller isn't supported as a gamepad. I use a Steam Controller on my main PC and have 4 other Steam Controllers on my Steam Link and I would like to be able to play the game without rebinding the controller to keyboard presses.  For the rest the game looks like fun, so for that I will still go for Yes with recommending this game, but only because there is no option between Yes and No."
514350,Fancy Slingshot VR,"fun to play - although the music gets annoyingly repetitive. after finishing the first level with the message 'You win' it did not go on to the next level. unclear to me how to select levels. but, could be very addictive!"
514390,PooShooter: Toilet Invaders,"The banner is an ♥♥♥ with sunglasses, what do you expect from this?"
514410,Gun Brothers,   Early Access Review
514470,Fantastic 4 In A Row 2,"Kind of gomoku where you're limited by 4 and your pieces are falling from the top. That's it. Keep calm, don't buy this game and play some free gomoku out there."
514480,Fantastic Checkers 2,"  My god, this is terrible. The graphics are ugly, the animation is also ugly, the sounds suck, and it advertises having lots of characters, but you can't even select them, they're just chosen at random. There are no settings to change the resolution, so I hope you like the default fullscreen mode. There are only two camera angles: a bird's eye view that makes it impossible to see the character models (although they're pretty ugly, so maybe that's upside?) and a side view that makes it impossible to see the positions of the tokens on the board.  There are no frills or anything. It's just Checkers. You can play with a friend or against an AI. That's it, that's the game. Literally just Checkers. Don't get me wrong, Checkers is a classic board game, but you could use any of a bazillion free versions of Checkers with better visuals and a more usable interface, or just bust out a physical board, and either way you'd have a much better experience than with this half-baked excuse for a Steam game."
514490,Ultimate Word Search 2: Letter Boxed,I just have to say this game might give you googley eye
514660,BitMaster,"Now that Steamplay is added, i couldn't reccommend this game more. this is one of the best dollars I have spent on Steam in all honesty. The pictures and videos shown are very accurate. Does it get a little repetitive? Yes and it makes unlocking characters a bit of a pain but even if you pick up and play this game for 20 min a day, you can still see the progress from round to round and it has kept me coming back."
514750,Nightmare Adventures: The Witch's Prison,The game won't play and it freezes
514780,Best in Show Solitaire,"I'll just play my Beagle for another 5 mins.... ! Great little casual. Shame about the higher resolution-screen size doesn't quite work right for me, other than that it is a complete and addictive time burner! Well made and the ability to feed your pooch as you move through a heavy round is good. Many interesting features to upset your plans on a good round and in the end it still remains a card game (without any suits structure at all)! Excellent value for money and should work on just about any pc I would imagine."
514890,Super Jagua,"This is probably the most accurate that a newer game has come to capturing what made retro games so great. There are no gimmicks, the physics are true to retro style games, the music is amazing, if you've been wanting to find a new 'old' game, this is it. The levels can become quite difficult, and there isn't a save feature, but this is being quite true to the source material it is (accurately) emulating."
514970,Drive Megapolis,"It wasn't working on my PC at all and crashed a few seconds after i've started a new game and what i've seen in that short period of time, was a mess. Sorry, had to refund, but maybe i will give it another chance, when it is (much) more polished."
515020,The VR Museum of Fine Art,"Well, Sir, Had This Game For Two [2] Days. When Bring Game Up Only Part Of Game Can Be Seen At Top. Starting At Middle There Es A Dark Rectangle. Tried Everything To Play Game, Restart, Verifing Files Deleted Game, Reinstalled And So On. Tried Moving, Yet Could Move Not Und Can Find The Options Not.  Have To Give This Game A Thumbs Down. :)"

If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine - which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay!   ‎‎‌ ‎‌ ‎‌ ‎‌‏‎‌ ‎‌ ‎ ‎‌ ‎‌ ‎‎‌ ‎‌ ‎ ‎‌‏We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states' votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why?   ‎‎‌ ‎‌ ‎‌ ‎‌‏‎‌ ‎‌ ‎ ‎‌ ‎‌ ‎‎‌ ‎‌ ‎ ‎‌‏Mr. Trump is unfit to serve.

515470,Hyper color ball,"So gameplay isnt that great, but the music is and thats the main reason why i play this game. "
515570,UBERMOSH Vol.3,"UBERMOSH Vol.3 is an arcade shooter/swordplay game. This game gave me 2.3 hours of entertainment, where my objective consisted in completing all the achievements. After that, there isn't anything else to do... meaning this is a really brief experience. Regardless, it was worth the 0,47€/0,50$, in my opinion (if you don't have anything else to do with this amount of money)."
515650,Straimium Immortaly,"This game boasts wonderful potential, given that it can buffer code reasonably. I truly admire the work put into this game. In the art lies wild wonders, as well as its style of play, and also the varying degrees of difficulty; this does not come to a stable fruition upon crashes. Every time an attempt is made to play, there will eventually come an error that doesn't allow the player to finish. A fresh reinstall may possibly be the benefit it needs, and if that works, this review will get changed, and fit with better context when I can finish a single playthrough."
515690,Warriors of Vilvatikta,  GOOD GAME! JUST LIKE FF7 PLEASE BUY AND PLAY. B) COOL DOGE IS HERE TO PLEASE U MASTER.
515910,Hooligan Vasja,Hooligan Vasja is a game that I recommend because: - it is a method to banish boredom - it has a good price - it is indie &amp; casual - it has action - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
516040,Everything is Peachy,"- repetitive Music is maddening - frustrating Controls - already from the tutorial level it is apparent - no free camera movement - after completing a few worlds - the bottom planets became unreachable -&gt; cannot see them or go to them  :( such a shame, this game has such a potential !! it could have been amazing... but now it just feels rushed."
516470,CRAPPY ZOMBIE GAME,Here's my first time gameplay video:   https://youtu.be/T0euJjfi0as   I also review other VR games on my channel:  www.youtube.com/user/rpatenaude   Cheap zombie game on steam I decided to check out. You get what you pay for and this one wasn't completely horrible. The gore effects were my favorite by far. Not sure if it was just me by I found the reloading / gun control extremely difficult.
516510,Orake Classic, Early Access Review
516550,Relativity,"This reminds me of Prey (anti-gravity walking on curved platforms), Portal (switch/lever puzzles), and Sonic the Hedgehog (the grass). I like it. It might make you feel weird, and that's part of the appeal for me. I use trackpad locomotion only."
516560,The Odyssey,great game perfect for my gcses next year but a bit of mouce lag still a great buy for 3 pounds

516680,Flying Baron 1916,"Thi s game starts out like it will be good, then the game starts. The control keys don't function so there is no easy control of the aircraft. It self destructcts anytime you get slightly above ground level saying you went too high. I tried changing the control keys on the options screen, but half of the ones I tried to enter didn't work in the game.   I was disappointed in this game because of the controls. I would not buy this one if I had known how bad it is to cotrol."

516920,Veilia,The gameplay is horrible. I really did try to get out of the cell by jumping on the stones but how much I tried I could not get on the second stone. Left me fraustrated. Will not play the game anymore.
516940,MineSweeper VR,"Only just downloaded this today, and clocked 20 games or so. However, its exactly what you expect. The same old Minsweeper game, just very neatly rendered in VR.   Interface is clear and easy, only a few controls (probe for mine, plant flag) and so very simple to pick up and play. It's a nice feeling to stand at the side of your grid and survey the available data while you make your decision on your next move - very fresh, and yet so familiar after losing so many hours to the original desktop clasic.   Good price too... 10/10"
517000,Sakura Shrine Girls,I love the game over all... But it would be allot better if there was a H-Patch and maybe some other changes made to it...
517010,Aztecalypse,"Ugh. I knew better when I spent the $1.79 on this game right after it launched, but I was hoping that somehow, someway the game would provide enough fun to make it worth the low asking price.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is my overly patient 'First Play on Launch Day' Impressions and Review Video:         YouTube™ Video:  Aztecalypse - First Play on Launch Day!

517060,Day of the Trumplings,"Very difficult, but still silly and fun."
517130,Soundboxing,"Very buggy. Pressing menu items seems to be entirely random on if it will work, and where it might take you. Will you go to the song? the leaderbaord? Will anything load at all? 4 out of 5 times when I loaded a song, the orb track woundn't load. When I got it working it was fine, then slowed to a crawl for the last minute. A great idea that's currently an unplayable mess."
517160,Richie's Plank Experience, Early Access Review
517170,Tvori, Early Access Review
517230,Spinning Maze,"The most temperamental game I've ever played.  This mobile-port might have been entertaining if it were not for the bazillion bugs. Incompatibilities with many video drivers, failing to save the last level. Corrupted saved games with Cloud Sync etc.  No settings or options to chage the resolution which is odd for Unity.  And where is the Steam Workshop?  Very poor and extremely frustrating indeed."
517240,Machinations: Fog of War,"Story is moderately interesting, but the reason I don't recommend it is because they tried to make the mechanics too complex and it failed horribly. Your goals are frequently poorly explained, people change gender mid-conversation, you can sometimes take actions based on information you haven't actually learned (or at the very least wasn't properly explained to the player), your character will sometimes talk about things that haven't happened, and certain confrontations can be repeated which is just bizarre."
517320,GunGirl 2,This is free and better than a lot of full price games! Great fun!
517330,Stellar Interface, Early Access Review
517350,Squareface,"  Great game so far, especially for being an indie one."
517360,The Secret Order 4: Beyond Time,"Nothing bad in this game but, nothing exciting as well so, I cannot recommend it."
517370,Tavernier,"This is a good indie management game with decent replay value for a low price. You are given proprietorship of a tavern, and you have 52 weeks to figure out what evil is happening in town, and to make necessary adjustments to your tavern in order to put a stop to this evil before the 52 weeks end. You will want to decide what factions you want your tavern to appeal to (folks, guards, rogues, wanderers, mages, etc.) by having your tavern bard play music that appeals to them, changing tavern decorations, changing menu items, and other changes. You will also be given a randomized moral decision every week that will increase and/or decrease certain attributes of your tavern (percentage of your customers that belong to different factions, how much gold you have, whether you choose to have a 'cool' or 'pro' tavern alignment, the customer tipping rate, total number of customers, etc.).   Depending on the changes you make to your tavern and the weekly decisions you make, this will affect the path you take and the ending, of which there are several pathways and endings. The first time you play, it may take two or three hours to finish, but every playthrough afterwards will take significantly less time because you will see certain recurring weekly decisions pop up every now and then. There is replay value in that there are different ways you can play depending on what weekly choices you make and what factions you appeal to. Unfortunately, while the weekly choices are randomized, there are not a lot of them in each pathway. Once you get to a third or fourth playthrough, you will start to notice a lot of reoccurring weekly decisions, which can feel repetitious and reduce the time of those playthroughs to around half an hour. However, this isn't an issue with me personally; this is because you still get a significant amount of content for the low price because of the variety of paths that you can take and the endings.  The artstyle is great, the music sets a good mood, and it controls very well. The negatives I have with Tavernier are minuscule. There are some minor spelling/grammar mistakes throughout the storyline and dialogue interactions with characters. Some of the outcomes from your weekly decisions don't make a lick of sense, and there are glaring plot holes in the storyline. Also, I noticed in a couple of my playthroughs that one or two randomized weekly decisions will pop up every single week in the latter half of the 52 weeks for some reason (possible bug?). Despite these shortcomings, I recommend Tavernier for providing good tavern management entertainment and replay value at a budget price."
517460,SteamHammerVR,"A steampunk themed, charming and nicely polished 'Hold off the hord' game. Not my cup of tea.  My original reaction was...  Another bloody hold off the hord game. Why would I stand in the middle of the damn street getting attacked from all sides...Ahh! And then having to stand there pacing waiting for the damn tutorial to finish again, with no way to skip the bloody thing. I'll steam hammer him in a minute! I could'nt delete this damn thing fast enough."
517470,King of Booze: Drinking Game,"Only played once so far, but planning on playing again very soon! Really fun game for up to 14 players. Everyone sets their name, colour, avatar and you're off. A click of the mouse spins the wheel and you get a choice of a dare of to take a certain number of drinks. Dares range from very easy, to so stupid, you really shouldn't do. Nice cartoony graphics. My only complaint would be the number of dares, as we did have the same ones appearing more than once."
517550,The Enlightened League of Bone Builders and the Osseous Enigma Content,"It does what it says, you build a bunch of bones into a skeleton and you have some stuff around the room to mess with as well. Think I got 2 mins 8 seconds, beat that noobs :P  Overall i'd say this little app deserves 4 leg bones connecting to the hip bone out of 6, it's pretty good :^)"
517660,Drop Out 0,"Really great concept, really poor execution. Got into a game with some buds and from the visuals to the sfx to the music to the gameplay itself, it's been pretty horrible. The hitboxes are unclear, the guns feel horrid, and the jump and run speed are infuriatingly slow for an arena shooter like this. Pretty huge disappointment, I'm refunding my purchase."

I don't need to play any more to tell that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. even if you're not into racing games. I have never clenched my butt harder on a practice tutorial round without any other racing contendants before. i've never clenched my butt harder in any racing game, period. Especially good if your internet is down."
517790,Caesar 3,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT CRASHES AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD AND STEAM REFUSE TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND REFUND AS THEY ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DO"
517810,Caesar 4," A much more improved game than Caeser 3.  Better animations, gameplay and more features with the same feel like the previous game.  I don't really feel accomplished winning in this game unlike Age of Empires, giving it sort of the 'endless' SimCity feeling. Not really my style, would rather stick with more prominent titles.  4/10"
517910,Sisyphus Reborn,"  Pros:       Enjoyed the music    A couple of the achievements were pretty decent for such a small game    Quick and easy 100% completion    Concept was good despite being a little basic    I  dig  the nod to Camus     Cons:      Couldnt help but feel like it was trying to be profound, just came off as a little pretentious    Did not enjoy the art style    Controls felt a little clunky    Think W A S D movement would have been more appropriate than click to move  "

517970,CRANGA!: Harbor Frenzy,"[Update: The most serious issue I had with the HTC Vive support has been resolved by the support with a simple setting (see below) – I'm changing my review to 'Recommend' because we had a lot of fun although the HTC Vive controller support is not perfect yet]  I cannot recommend this because the HTC Vive support is rather bad.  - You'll have to make sure to look into the right direction when first starting the game or the whole container stack will be out of reach [Update: This can easily be fixed by going into the Steam VR menu &gt; Settings &gt; Reset seating position (while looking into your play area)] - The controller instructions are not for vive controller – figure out what A and B is on your vive controller - The 'Repositioning' with A doesn't work as the button is controlling your crane - When you get a trophy you're stuck with 'Press any key to continue' – but that doesn't work with the vive controller – take off your headset and press a key on your keyboard it is  It's a shame, this could be fun  Also.. I don't get how local multiplayer with switching headsets works.. P1 seems to be able to play forever until he ♥♥♥♥s up and looses – when exactly do you switch headsets?!

This has been my go-to when showing people my Vive. Its intuitive for all levels of players making it perfect to play in groups as everyone can watch and have a good time. The VR really adds a whole new level of comedy to the experience which keeps me coming back. If you're looking for a fun game which most people can enjoy while also maintaining challenging aspects for advanced players then I would highly suggest giving this game a try."

519490,NBA 2KVR Experience,"NBA 2K VR Experience Gameplay and first 30 minute impressions and video review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlFvBr9JmTY   NBA2KVR is made entirely for VR and contains different single player game challenges, skill gameplay modes, tutorial elements as well as local multiplayer support to enjoy NBA2K VR together with your friends at home!   This arcade-style NBA2K game in Virtual Reality has roomscale support, but its of course not a full basketball game with full gameplay and matches. Its more of a challenging basketball scenario-game full of funny game modes, skill shots, trickshots etc. that you can practice, gain points on and have fun with together with friends or just playing alone.   NBA2KVR Experience has great graphics, perfect sound and sountracks, very good presence in-game, good control system using the HTC Vive wireless motion controllers and it really feels immersive in many ways. If you play basketball in real life, or just enjoy the sport, I think you should really give it a try as its - so far - the best Basketball VR Experience out there!  I really hope they will add more gameplay modes in this game, and I will continue this review as soon as I have been playing some more and as soon as more content is added. But so far, im recommending this game to everyone of you that likes basketball - this is a cool experience!  Cheers SweViver"
519940,Kubz VR,"Fun concept. I'd like if there was a few different game modes (Zen, Original, Variable Difficulty maybe?)  It was pretty involved physically, there's not really a way to 'reach' and set a block down, you actually need to more. It's nice for the fact that it gets players involved."

520850,Lost in Secular Love,"因本人中文不是特別好(其實只是打字比打英文慢orz)，所以以下感想就用英文打&gt;_&lt;  Okay, first off, the idea of romancing monks is a very interesting one. Caught me off guard, to be perfectly honest lol. And to be perfectly honest once again, one of the things that got me sold for this game is that one sexy preview CG of Huihai and MC &gt;//&lt;  I think the writing is really well written, although I guess because of the length of the game, the way the relationships progress felt somewhat rushed. Well, except for Ziqing, I suppose. I like MC's overall personality a lot, and I can relate with her on many things.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HUIHAI AND ZIQING. Ziqing because I am a sucker for childhood friends, although he sometimes annoyed me because of his tsundere personality. But once you get past his sharp tongue and start seeing the meaning behind his actions, he's pretty sweet! Huihai becuase I am also a sucker for megane/glasses. And also because of the similarities between MC and Huihai lol. Unlike with Ziqing, I really like Huihai's interactions with MC. They can relate and even have fun because both are extremely frugal lol, and I think that MC is in desperate need of a friend, considering her situation. Also, HIS BLUSHES MAN, HIS BLUSHES. And as for Zhikong...I'm certain there are people who loves this type of thing, but personally, it left quite a bad taste in my mouth, even with the happy ending. Not sure how to describe it more without spoiling anything else, so you'll just have to play his route to know, I suppose.  I also love the music and the art. The art is really good!! Just look at the preview CGs and tell me it isn't, for an indie otome game.  I really wish this game was in English. I was quite lonely chatting with my friends about this game and they really really want to play it too, but can't because they can't understand Chinese lol. But to those who do understand Chinese, I think this is a really good game for it's price, and it's fully-voiced, too!!"
520910,Kokurase,A fun game with an interesting mechanic. I haven't seen many rpg games where you switch between characters this way.  spoilers: My only problem is that I'm stuck in the girls locker room and I can't find the camcorder. Idk if I'm doing something wrong but I've clicked everywhere and gotten nothing.
520990,Barrow Hill: The Dark Path,"The game runs in a tiny box regardless of resolution. Im not a fan of the genre in general, i bought this by accident so dont take my review into account when buying but there seems to be a technical issue with the game.  Since it runs in a window (set at fullscreen) everything is super small so I cant find objects as easy as i should. Why doesnt it take up the whole screen? Even at 1080p its only using about 1/4 of my total screen.  I also dont care for the audio, the music got grating incredibly fast...I only played a few min and I didnt like it. I also didnt like the main menu, the way it rotates is odd and unpleasant looking. Lastly it takes forever to get into the game. It hangs on the intro screens for far too long and then once you start there is an unskippable cutscene...i dont like cutscenes that cant be skipped even if i do want to watch them. It ruins a second run through the game.  Again dont take this review too seriously...this genre isnt for me but I wanted to leave a review due to the technical issues i came across in the short 6 min I played."

521280,Atlantis: Pearls of the Deep,"Nice storyline and art. Good relaxing time waster. Some of the levels are a little difficult for what it is and the difficulty does not quite flow up with the levels (it will increase in difficulty slowly, then you will get a ridiculous one, then an easy one) It also has a few problems where the ball/pearl gets stuck in some levels.  But is really good over all."

521430,Super Switch,"It's good the idea pf it is great, but the controls suck First of all when playing with the gamepad (This one BTW -  http://www.game.co.uk/en/xbox-one-pro-ex-controller-green-only-at-game-981317)  on level 2 the red platform is already on, then when i go to pull the right trigger it does  NOTHING  So i go to use the keyboard here's what wrong with it: - It's LShift to switch not LShift OR RShift, that's super annoying - The best way i can play is left hand on right hand, try it now, IT SUCKS - You cannot keybind I like this game but it is kinda unplayable (Also i know it says 360, i dunno if it's cus i use a 3rd party XB1 Gamepad (Thought i'd just throw that in there)) as long as you fix the controls i'm fine  Anyway besides bad controls this game is great 7/10 (Just cus) "
521450,Hunted: One Step too Far,"   I started the game and really enjoyed it at the beginning. The sound and environment were great for a small erngine (Game Guru). The developer added little touches to the outside world with pigeons along some of the rooftops, various rabbits hopping around and even a few deer here and there. Once, we got to the Asylum, everything went downhill. What started as a walking sim with pages to read becomes a running sim as stone statues try to get you along with a few undead inmates walking the halls. When I first saw the inmate, your first creature encounter, I laughed. It wasn't spooky. Just comical. The statues were gargoyles (the best creatures in the game) and a female statue. That is all you will encounter in the game. The rest of the game in the Asylum is just running while finding keys and unlocking doors while trying to read the occasional note which tries to explain some of this and at times you will not have a moment to read them because another gargoyle is slamming into you from behind trying to kill you. The explanation for why the guy who brought you here and the monsters he controls is lame. Nothing special. Near the end you will be tortured with a 'climb the extremely long jumping platform puzzle' (I posted a photo) and then finally escape the Asylum. Afterwards, it will turn into a walkling simulator again with a lone statue following you every once in a while. This part of the walking sim is LONG. God awful long. As others have stated that fps drop when you are outside. I'm talking 8 fps on a Titan X folks. Add that to an already ridiculously long walking sim to get to the end and you are bored. You'll just wish it was over. They must have added this long pathway just to pad the playtime to 2+ hours. Finally, at the end the police already got the bad guy while you were busy sleeping and walking all along the countryside. His assistant, Tom (you'll find out a tiny bit about him if you read the correct lone note before entering the Asylum) is nowhere to be found or even mentioned. We do know he tries to tip off the bad guy to warn him the police are nearby and that is all. Leaving you at the very end that the statues are still out there and you may be hunted. Um....yeah....whatever. And the final tedious act we are left with is to be forced to watch the credits with no way to escape them. Great start but an overall bad game. Not worth your time. Oh, and you may encounter the occasional crash and a green screen that takes over the entire screen when you load a saved game. The developer's solution is for you to completely exit the game and restart it as this is a solution for other games using Game Guru that also have the same problem. Have fun doing that a few times! :(- [/spoiler  "
521470,Magical Otoge Ciel,"Evidently, the developer put so much thought into the characters and the game itself, can't believe it's for free! Awesome lines that will keep you grinning at most time, give it a try!    However, one thing to keep in mind is since it is basically just a visual novel, your choices don't necessarily change the story and the character selection is just straightforward. Interesting storyline anyways."

521540,This World Unknown,"  One of the best visual novel otome(?) game I've ever played! I've got this game from a giveaway and I've been overjoyed before and after playing it. The story is amazingly WELL-written I'd sell most of my games and books to obtain such a masterpiece &lt;3 one of the major things I look in a game is plot and well, if the art is good, and this is like one of the first VN really that deserves an oscar.   I've enjoyed playing this amazing game and I'd really recommend it to anyone who enjoys real games with real expectations! the art is amazing, the soundtracks are relaxing. Also, one of the greatest things aside the plot, the characters are well built I liked the complexty of their personalities and how they communicate each other!  gotta say, I love the trio Rhea,Asa and Luca! their routes were amazing, hoped there would a kiss scene for Rhea and Asa but nevertheless, the ending was kinda satisfying xb   Now, I'm playing Dr. Vally~ and I'm actually sad to split the trio apart :( for the sake of vally and may he find the right path &lt;3   Overall the game is 10/10 with a golden medal for making me live the game and never doubt the choices of the games &lt;3"

521990,Galactic Storm,"standard shmups,but too less levels,consider its price,still a good game."
522010,Lost Crew,  At first I was a fan of the unique nature of this game where you need to reset time as you learn new information. However you aren't really solving anything but more so checking off different bad routes in order to get good information and then take the bad routes. In reality there's only one 'puzzle' in the entire game and that is solely due to the fact that the information needed to solve the situation is never recorded (unlike all other information in the game that helps you progress). Basically the game creates artificial difficulty by not following its own rules.  I got near the end of the game (you must save all crew members to achieve the ending) and proceeded to still have not found some information needed to succeed. Now I know how to get the information but in order to get it I need to undo all the work I did to get so close to the ending and then set things up incorrectly so that Michael feels compelled to tell me the information I need even though I know Michael has the information I need. You'll find you need to purposelly achieve fail states in order to get the right information you need to achieve the one ending the game has.  The game is entirely linear with only one correct route and only one way to go about accomplishing that one route. By the point I was at with the game I opted to just uninstall the game and write this review instead of restarting over as explained previously.  The game has a unique concept but the required amount of restarting just to get information you the player know to ask certain characters for (but can't) is arbitrary and therefore bad design. I can't ask Michael for the information he has about the situation I'm going to fail until I restart and put Michael into a failure state and then I can ask him about the information that I the player (you play as yourself so you have all knowledge the protagonist has) already know he has.  The plot of the game isn't all that interesting anyway so I doubt the pay off is even worth it to finish it. It's worth 2 bucks I suppose so at least the developer knows the correct price point. It's only worth playing if you're interested in seeing the mechanic of time restarting used poorly.
522020,Blue Effect VR, Early Access Review
522030,Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy,"This is a tough one to recommend as I am a big fan of the board game.  From a video game perspective, it needs LOT of work. Limited video and sound options (not even a sound slider for the short repeating track). Iplay this on a 44' 1080p television in the living room and I need to lean up in my chair to see the money + values. No options to resize font.  No keyboard shortcuts that I can find. I use a Steam Controller, so it is easy to use just right pad as mouse, trigger for clicks, and that's about it. Would be nice if I could map the buttons to view opponents, ships, etc. Unless there's an option I am not seeing.  VERY limited options. Auto battle and the option to disable the OP missles.  So many missed opportunities. The missles could have been altered, maybe to just deal 1 hit instead of 2 (I believe the expansion resolves this issue). No greater single player experience other than achievements.   There are many more games space empire games on the PC that have much more content for the price. Hopefully updates will improve options and content.  *ahem* with that said, if you can get past all of that, its still one of my favorite euro games, and this port is addicting and fun to try out all the different factions.  I may recommend this more for tablets than for PC, but recommended for those looking for a more calculating 4x management game."
522040,Princess Remedy In A Heap of Trouble,"Pretty fun. If you like the first game you'll like this too. It's slightly longer and your flask can now be replaced by all sorts of abilities depending on who you date. (Didn't Princess Remedy get married in the first game???)     The secret boss after the final boss is really really hard, even with level 6 power from the Jealous Chest.  "

522490,Carrie's Order Up,"This game... is quite a timekiller.  The gamplay is simple, yet enjoyable, as any arcade game ought to be. The visuals are appealing for two reasons; one, they really harken back to the old days, when I played on my sega mega drive. Just saying that name is just so nostalgic. And two, it's just plain adorable, which I'm a sucker for.  That said, it can get a little chaotic on later levels, when the restaurant's full of customers who won't just CHOOSE A SEAT and SIT! And whose kid is that running around when I'm trying to work?!?  Still, I loved it. It's cheap, challenging and easy to play."
522570,The Last Hope,"I find it hard to write a negative review for a game that's as cheap as this, but, hell. I wouldn't even reommend it at a 1$ Price tag, it's broken, buggy, glitchy and it just does not work, it's extremely boring as 3/4 of your time is just going around aimlessly trying to figure out what the hell is going on."

523000,Princess Maker 2 Refine,"Well well well, it appears there was a patch after all. Goodie! So lets talk about the only negative; the removal of debug menu. This is a long game to play multiple times, and the debug menu helped swing the outcome of time in your favor.  Buuuuut  The game itself is still one of the most clever titles I've played in some time. For as short as I played it, I made sure to take good care and maticlous pride in raising a ballenced regal-to-be.  The elements of combat, morality, and social skills blend rather well. Coupled with reading phrases to adress what should be studided, and NOT looking at the numbers all the time, this is something that in its current state, is worth checking out!    ---OCTOBER 5 Original--- Let me be frank here and say I LOVE Princess Maker 2, But for the improvments made in its english release is very disapointing. Buggy acheivment support, No end game text, and worse yet, typography issues that clutter the screen (I'm looking at you magic milk). Untill this game becomes fixed with an ending and better translation with achivments, I sadly can not reccomend it in its current state."

If you are okay with those points my only suggestion is to maybe avoid the 'shuffle' button as pressing it has caused the game to crash to the point that not even the task manager can be brought up to attempt to force close the program; I trust this may be fixed in the future."
523160,Alice's Patchworks 2,"TL;DR 5/10 Lovely pictures; stressful assembly; AP2 is slightly better on timer expectations than AP1; same exact engine/game  These are lovely mosaics; unfortunately, color matching to your expected vision of the picture is usually not helpful at all; adjacent pieces almost never match in color. Instead, you are intently focusing on matching shape continuity (By contrast, most jigsaw puzzles are assisted by color matching.)  Only 5 pieces are available at any time. Pieces can be dropped into the correct framed position at any time. The button in the upper right corner provides a mechanic for the game to reveal the correct placement of a piece, every 30 seconds. Because of restricted availability of pieces that must be dropped into the center of a void, this mechanic cannot be realistically avoided for a more challenging experience, unless you memorize piece locations from previous runs. Especially at the beginning of assembly, this mechanic must be used wisely to create good reference points for shapes.  Using earned coins from level completion, the 30 second reveal can be refreshed earlier. Also, coins can be used to add 30 seconds to the completion timer. Of course, full Achievments require 3 star completion under the expected time limit (or limit + paid extensions.)  I just finished AP2 and found it slightly better for realistic expectations on the completion timer than AP1. In AP2, I never spent any coins to refresh the 30 second reveal button or to extend the timer.  Unfortunately, the last 2 Achievment require the player to earn 1,000,000 coins. I completed all puzzles with 3 stars, accumulating 530,000 coins. Like most any puzzle, there is not much replay value. Redoing the first 1 piece puzzle 500 times at 20 second intervals is the quickest way to grind through their broken achievments. Monotony for 3 hours?   These Achievements are flawed by the developer's failure to beta test their game with even 1 single test-player."
523170,ShotForge,Just couldn't find the fun in it. 
523670,Adventures Of Fluzz,THATS MY GAME :)
523680,Honey Rose: Underdog Fighter Extraordinaire,The game is in 4:3. And the speech text is sooo small. And somewhy it is in the little box in the corner... Visual novel where you can't see the text - an unplayable game. Even if it is kind of free.
523710,Sword Master VR,"Not a bad game at all. The controls are simple and work well, wouldn't mind having a shield in the beginning or dual wield. Hit detection works relatively well although it gets a bit choppy when the characters crowd you. A few swings at their shield or sword will force them to backstep though. This will give you a really good workout swinging your arms around and stepping around in your box."
523720,Unruly Ghouls,Great idea that fits the VR design well. I look forward to seeing how they improve on this concept with additional content. It's good to see a price that fits the model.
523730,Sweet Volley High,"The art style is cute and the stroy is written well for the most part, with few errors. However it's not paced very well sometimes feeling like it went in circles causing me to get a bit bored reading this pictacular VN. I honestly only completed it to get the achivements. Yuka has the best written route over with an interesting twist at the end as many have said. Eri is a fun character and was a welcome addition to the cast. However, the characters still felt a bit forced at times.  I dunno if it was just a problem with my installation but there was almost no audio lines at all limited instead ot just four words, 3...2...1 and Mizuki. I ended up muting the audio right after the summer break, so I'm not sure if there was anything later on.   I'd give this one a 2.5/5, nice pick up for the price and supporting english VN development, but over all not anything that'll blow your mind."
523940,ZombVR, Early Access Review
524030,Machine Learning: Episode I,"It started with pretty good challenges, but as it got to the coordination test it goes bad fast. The control of those two hovercrafts at the same time is nuts and reached a point where I didn't really care. I also can't skip it. Yeah, i could spend the next hour trying to do it over an over, but do I want to? Nope."
524120,Raptor Valley,"A great little game to play at parties or to introduce people to VR. Gameplay and replay are limited though.  Surround Sound headphones STRONGLY recommended!  PROS: -Great jump scares.  -The raptors are visible for exactly the right amount of time. Just as you realized you saw it, it is gone.   NEUTRALS: -Voice on the radio doesn't make much sense but I only played the first few 'hours' of the night.  CONS: -Fairly repetitive. -Menus are dreadfully lacking (only a 'select your starting time' which is basically stage select....no options and I couldn't figure out how to quit without going to my computer). "
524380,Yore VR, Early Access Review
524490,Shadron,This product isn't very good. It doesn't even come with an editor. You program in notepad or your favorite editor. If I had to do over I would not have bought this product.
524520,Fatehaven,"During my first playthrough, I was thinking I'd come here and give a recommended review for sure. The story was pretty good, even if you are constantly assumed to be a pervert... but playing through it a second time made this an easy not recommended review unfortunately. I play Choose Your Own Adventure style games like this because I like to have the choices and see the different ways everything can resolve. Sadly, most of the 'choices' in my second playthrough (Where I was choosing the opposite of what I did in the first playthrough of course) quickly turned in, 'You realize that's a bad idea and do the other thing.' That kind of illusion of choice then forcing me to do what I didn't choose really annoys me.  So, if you only play the game once, I'd consider it. If you're like me and play it through many times to see all the different endings, don't bother."
524540,Samurai of Hyuga,"So... Fresh off of my first read-through, and my first review in forever.  Where do I start with this one? As far as stories go, SoH is very, very well written. Choices invoke thought, dialogue has a few very nice jokes within, and overall it is a tale very much worth reading, and a story I would very much recommend to a lot of people. When I was gifted this I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into, but holy hell am I glad I read it through. I'm not going to say too much about this, mostly because I believe the best stories are ones you experience blind, but if you're even thinking of giving a shot: do so. It's only $5, and while it may not be considered a 'game' by the terminology of most of those on this platform, it very much deserves being called as a fantastic story that you'll have trouble putting down until you reach the end. It's short, unfortunately, but the well-crafted story and amazing writing more then make up for it.  -K"
524560,Samurai of Hyuga Book 2,"Love this stoy so far, but dont realy feel like much was a complished in Book 2...though that said it used the time to build up the characters and the relasionships you have with them...as well as seting the ground work for the start of the next book which i think is a good thing. Though there is one glareing flaw i have to point out. THE 3rd BOOK IS NOT OUT YET! GAH! T.T soo mean..."
524600,Dark Parables: Curse of Briar Rose Collector's Edition,"This is the first in the series and it is pretty weak compared to others I have played.   Pros: Stratagy Guide Collectables Lovey artwork Lots of HOP screens Nice puzzles inbetween HOPs  Cons: NO Map! NO fast travel - and sometimes I got quite lost trying to find a certain room Hint system only seems to work in HOPs I really needed the Stratagy Guide because it was difficult to figure out the story/where to go. One 'location' was just the corner of a building (sort of weird and confusing - only found it because sometimes it sparkles). Sometimes felt very thin - often maybe only one thing to pick up in a site.  These points are just so you know what to expect. I understand that this is the first game put out so am rather forgiveing here. It was pleasent to work through, once I got used to the idea of using the Stratagy Guide all the time. Worth playing as part of the series, which really does get better. Worth a replay it in the future.     "
524650,DANGEROUS DUELS,"A simple and effective premise, definitely pick this up if you're in need of a good local multiplayer game.  It's exactly how you'd imagine a Mexican standoff, but with the addition of giant slow bullets which can be used for area denial as you zip around the board. There are also a surprising amount of customization options to tailor things to your liking (I suggest enabling 'full reloads required' to avoid letting people cheese engagements via spamming reload). It's super fun, and has earned a place in my permanent roster of 'good games to play at a party'."
524660,RutonyChat,Many useful features and friendly support makes this application #1 for streamers. Strictly recommended
524690,Bitslap,"I do enjoy this game, and it is worth a purchase if you like vr games that test your endurance. However I feel like the sales blip 'play your own music' is a bit misleading. I was under the asumption this would be a rhythm game, like audio shield, since it had an emphasis on custom music. Still, the gameplay itself is fun and the visuals are stimulation without it being tied to music.  Best comparison I can make is it's a virtual whack a mole game, with a minimalist art style. Simple but fun. Worth checking out if you want exercise while you play a game."
524850,Alicemare,"Sound file rear error , sound file load error cannot locate the sound file, may i know what can i do with this kind of error or how can i fix it? I can't tolerate a game with no bgm."
524970,Helmet Heroes,I don't recommend this game because it crashed my computer 2 times in 2O minutes. It is a good game... but it's just going to end up breaking your computer it might even be a virus....
525080,The Race for the White House 2016,"If you want to waste some quick cash, feel free. The system this uses to declare a victor is very biased, and does not allow for third parties to even stand a chance at victory, even if you follow up on all the hot-topic issues. This game is complete trash, and a waste of time."
525100,SLIVER.tv, Early Access Review
525190,The Construct,"  Received this product from a friend as a surprise gift. I wish I could recommend this game but as with other reviewers I will agree that the controls aren't very good. The setting, scenario, and mood were all great for what I played of it (not much), but I couldn't keep going because the controls are unresponsive to turning and you'll randomly keep floating in a direction by minute amounts after you should have stopped. In tight spaces that means you die, and that's annoying when you have to redo a bunch of other timing segments from the last checkpoint.  This isn't dark souls difficulty, where mistakes are your fault and can be correct. This is 'core design has flaws' difficulty, and it's just not fun."
525210,Nock: Hidden Arrow, Early Access Review
525350,Thick Air, Early Access Review
525370,Gobernators (Parodia política peruana),"The level design of this game is garbage, seems made by a 5 year child that at some point play Mario.   I don't understand how can name a game like Megaman, even Might°9 is better and that's say a lot.   They not even were able to remove the startup options of unity and make decent logos.   It is a game clearly made for cell phone and I note this every second from how the menu works until pixelated images in game.  "
525450,King Oddball,"Very simplistic in nature, I've only made it through two 'Sudoku fields' and I like it a lot, it's simplistic but not simple. (it can be a bit tricky getting the angles and so on)  Update: The value proposition seems ridiculous considering that all you do is wait and press a button (left mouse/space) and maybe R to restart if you failed, but there's a ton of stuff in it....  I've now - apparently - played 4 hours and I have 3 blacked out squares and one half-way done...maybe still not worth it for close to 5 €, maybe...then you also have to realize I have 125/131 diamonds left to get (these are full games) 13 'boom challenges', all six teplephone calls with the king, 14 of the 'one rock' challenges. (and there may be more hiding under the still balck bits...)  I play it a lot now while uploading to Youtube, this is the perfect game for such things, you can just jump in and play a bit and then quit as you have other things to do, just a perfect little timewaster, a timewaster that can make you rage....but you'll still love it. :)"
525500,Candy Kingdom,"  WOW!.. that was pretty awesome! game ran very smooth, colours were vibrant, and i love the music. Very catchy and kinda danceable as you bounce around and shoot the candies and hearts. I really enjoyed riding the train as you shoot, ride was very smooth, and not nauseous at all.The sound the gingerbread man makes when you kill him is quite funny and cute. I have to say that, there's been a lot of plain basic games coming out on the vive lately, kinda rushed, but this one looks is complete. I highly recommend this as this is was pretty addictive, and immersive. I've been kinda harsh on the types of games coming out, so this was quite refreshing to see, and play. Two thumbs up from me :)"
525540,Six Feet Under,Interesting and different. Not a bad game at all. Easy controls and a different concept make all the difference here. Would give it an 8/10.  
525600,Dyno Adventure,No No No... Remove Remove Remove. NOBODY has anything original these days and STEAM loves to cater to them... Same thing over and over and over and over and over and over andover and over.
525610,Hardware Engineering,"I am a electrical &amp; electronics engineer. This app is just bad, the wiring is hard to use and not user friendly. It tooks longer time to make a circuit than using computer app. To make this better, I would suggest make it more user friendly. For those who are stuck, you can read books about Digital Electronics."
525640,Bullets And More VR - BAM VR, Early Access Review
525740,Slashy Hero,"I enjoy the game immensely. It's simple mechanics are fun, and the collection aspect of getting costumes that are both fun to look at and help boost your stats is great. However, I cannot recommend this game due to how badly it plays.   The game lags on my computer, which can play high end AAA titles with no hiccups. I've tried to troubleshoot the issue, but I can't figure out why this simple game is having so many issues. It freezes during load screens and the frame rate is attrocious. Really sad, considering how fun it is."
525780,Doorways: Old Prototype,Not any good past the first level.
525860,Garden Wars,"  Most accurate simulation of the 2016 elections I have played so far.  More seriously, this game does what it says on the box. It is a fun quick 1v1 land grab battle."

526470,Deep Below,"This game is a lot more fun than people are giving credit for. THE GAME IS FREE. Of course, there are free games that are absolutely mind boggling, this game did well.   Now, there are bugs, but they can easily be fixed :) The one thing that really annoyed me was the respawn trap I got into.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJsZ5uZKlKI  I did this Let's play so you guys can see, if it is okay with the creators! You can see for yourself that the game runs quite well, just a little dark (which you get something later to fix) and the respawn bug. I hope this helps you guys, but overall, yes, I do recommend it!"
526490,Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.4 Himatsubushi,"As it is right now, i can not recommend buying this game. As others have reported, there are numerous typos, which are a real big no-no for a game that is essentially noting but text.  As for myself, the game crashes upon trying to exit, consistently, forcing me to open up task manager and 'End Task' to close it. A problem i had with the last chapter as well. So far almost all my play time was attempting to troubleshoot this issue to no avail.  If Mangagamer ever fixes these issues i'd happily re-review it and most likely change this to a recommendation. As it is NOW, don't waste your money on a slapdash product."
526540,8infinity,**Pros: +The game has many resolution sizes. +You can play the game in windowed mode. +You can play the game in fullscreen mode. +There is only a toggle sound volume. No slidebars or adjustments. +There is only a toggle music volume. No sliderbars or adjustments. +You can play the game split screen or on the internet.  +You can play the game with a controller.  **Cons: Couldn't find any ^^
526590,Boxing Saga,"To be clear, I found it hard to click the 'yes' button with regards to being able to recommend this game. It's by all accounts shallow, silly and lacks any semblence of realism or overall effort. If you're looking for a boxing sim, or something with some substance, I recommend passing it up.  That being said, I knew all of this before I hit the purchase button thanks to some honest reviews, not that the half-♥♥♥♥♥ translations or gameplay videos themselves didn't give it away. I bought it anyway because I thought what the hell, it's $5 and looks like a decent arcade experience. What you get is an endless wave of completely stupid AI with canned animations, unrealistic mechanics, but an addictively fun time knocking dudes out every minute or two. I found myself laughing at the different combinations I could slap together with the final killer hook, straight or uppcut making the AI go limp.   With regards to the actual mechanics, it's stupid enough to go as far as holding down the trigger while you punch to provide a power shot. You would think with VR, power shots would be determined by...power. Body shots are non-existent. Blocking is non-existent. Sometimes the hit box for the AI's head won't even register, seems to be related to certain animations. Movement might as well be non-existent because the enemy is glued at a fixed range from you and floats right with you if you cover any distance over a couple feet from your starting position.   Still though, I'm entertained and it's yet another game to get the heart rate up, if only moderately.   Only buy it if you have $5 to ♥♥♥♥ away and think punching dudes unconscious with haymakers over and over and over and over and over is something you might get a little joy out of.   If you want an actual attempt at an in-depth boxing experience, and more importantly one that has a bright potential future with a developer who is constantly updating it, check out Thrill of the Fight. That game is superior to Boxing Saga in every way imagineable."
526680,Lifeliqe VR Museum,A great start! Keep going! This is showing great promise and the initial play has many pleasant surprises and moments of wonder. This can end up being a great teaching tool.

526750,The Gleam: VR Escape the Room,"This is a great concept and I wish it was longer, but fair for the price. It is challenging, and I am still trying to crack it msyelf and having fun doing so.  We need more games/experinces like this. I think this is one of those games that showcase what the Vive can do and that it can provide gaming experinces outside of the norm."
526780,Jumper Jape,"  Followed this game throughout the development, also recieved a free copy for the game. But bought 3 copies to give out to friends just because the game is great.  10/10 GOTY - IGN 10/10 ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ - Rock paper shotgun 10/10 Harder than my ♥♥♥♥ - Playboy 9/10 A game for women - Vogue 10/10 JÄVLA BRA SPEL - Aftonbladet"

526880,Chess Knight 2,Very cheap and lazy excuse for a game. No instructions and can't switch between black/white. I even recognized one of the background music tracks to be from another game (Braid). I got this game in a $1 bundle and I regret spending that damn dollar.
526890,A Day in the Woods,Beautiful puzzle game with some fun stuff to unlock like seasonal backgrounds and sprite customizations. Completing a level may not seem too difficult until you try for those 3 star ratings. A nice challenge and fun to play. I got this one on sale but it's definitely worth the regular price of $4.99.
527160,Cmoar VR Cinema UHD,"180/360 doesn't have 3D view in Sphere mode. It just a flat image. :/ I was hoping to see the same thing like the Vive Cinema, the 180/360 view in 3D work like a charm.  It is possible to add an option to Clear the view Histories.  Hoping to see this features in a near update."
527210,Janken Cards,Controller support for only one gamepad  +  Profiles that you can't delete (Not even manually becasue the game's save folder is deeply hidden)  = Poop
527330,Grave VR,Grave VR is excellent. Atmospheric and very scary. Story driven so you feel compelled to go onwards even though the creatures get more diverse and numerous. Devs: Could you replace the in-game vive controllers with hands? Would be alot more immersive. Great job and this title deserves more praise!
527340,What The Box?,"  I bought this on an impulse. I saw a video of it, and 10 minutes later I had a copy. Well, a friend gifted it to me, but I ended buying 5 copies and gifting it to people. This game is dumb fun, and that is why it is awesome. I am not very good at it, but I have played it for hours in one sitting and not been tired of it. Every round, every map, even with the same people, is different and fun. Red team vs blue team adds to that.  In short, this game is the dumb fun game I didn't l was looking for. I look forward to a game night with people I know, and I highly recommend it for group games. You'll be screaming the title by the night is over."

527510,The Legions of Rome,"If you want some excellent strategy without elements of shooter and have not very good iron of computer,u will chose this game.It's truly nice done on Unity for Indi.   About charter:  U start from small tribe of some units in Italy and will take power over large territories,will do your strongest empire.    0ptions in game and some about incidental music:  I decided turn off music after 30 minutes of my game hanging,because the music sounds good for the first time, but continue to be repeated again and again...Not more options doing this game comfortable.But I couldn't choise my resolution 1600-900)   Gameplay:  Any guys say that game unplayable but idk what they main...*Now I know - play on window on first version!* U have very big choice - what will attack, which fractions consider friendly, which hostile.Which sciense to develop,which not. What resources to produce more which is less than.I recomend hard level,becase game some easy) And your wars happening with Tower Defence ganre.  Price is really not bad,if u like strategy and have bad pc. 6/10 because game will ne better with time,developer can do more for 'The Legions of Rome' like multiplayer mod,more resolution on options,more interesting gameplay!GOOD luck for game;)"

527710,Crown Champion: Legends of the Arena,"NEW EDIT: many of the negative points I talked about have been fixed/improved by the 1.2 update. I haven't had time to test everything in depth but the most concerning issues have been fixed, so I adjusted this to a thumbs up without any regrets.   Pros"
527730,Bus Tycoon ND (Night and Day),"  I got this game off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for like 59 coins but it doesn't mean it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I actually liked this game because it reminded me of egg.inc"
527750,Merger 3D,"So far I'm not really into it. It's set up like a classic Doom-engine game and mostly plays like one, but the levels I've been in so far aren't well designed and the gameplay is quite boring and ultra-bare bones. Not really nostalgic or similar to level designs like Doom or Wolfenstein as it's just pure BANG BANG BANG. BANG BANG BANG. With really no goal in sight and gets boring pretty damn fast. You essentially just get a straight line flow of enemies and then you're done. No searching no things to pick up really except one ammo item and one health item of which it seems like there's too much of to really have any difficulty or challenge, not even really a maze to go through, maybe a few weaving turns in your otherwise straight path to the next level. Yawn. Glad it cost about nothing."
527760,Just Hero,"Plot: Absolutely none given  Pros: Cheap, easy perfect game (most of game)  Cons: Boring, no plot, hard at end  Comments: I would like to say more but there is not much to say. Cons outnumber pros but the pros outweigh the cons, thus it is recommended. It took me 1.2 hours to 100% complete the game and I will NEVER play it again but it was an easy perfect game. The end of the game is hard to progress through. The last level is especially hard due to the oneway through lava which loses you a life, then another loss. No matter what you do, the end result is the same. There are three blocks that move up, down, and a little to the left and right. There is a gorge beneath them and they move almost every two seconds. If you manage to make it past that part (took me half an hour) you must walk along a long path and you come to another moving block and the end. The thing that sucks the most and makes the game super difficult: the fall damage. Seriously, who makes a platformer with fall damage?"
527770,Russian SuperHero Dead Ivan,"At the begin it looks a little glitchy, but it is a game that is just released so this is normal in some way, It gets funny sometimes once u get past the first part,  But you gotta get to know Ivan!

527990,Gladiator Trainer,This is a good solid game and worth the very little I spent on it. Enjoy!
528070,Solitaire Beach Season,"Extremely lackluster re-skinned version of 'Solitaire Christmas. Match 2 Cards'. The same unfair mechanics that make the layouts completely random (so not winnable every time) combined with even more 'complex' layouts make this game just annoying to play. There's no story, no special levels, just nothing that holds your interest. There are a lot better solitaire games on Steam, so avoid this one."

528510,Turbo Pug 3D,"Fun simple game, a few more features would be nice though. Such as maybe single use power ups you can purchase with coins as, now that I have unlocked the crown, I am just collecting coins for nothing which feels a bit useless.  The jump is also a bit buggy/laggy for me at times causing me to die but overall the game is decent, good for a casual play.  edit: gonna change it to not reccomended until the jump lag is fixed because it's annoying and frustrating when you keep dying because of it"

The gameplay is less fun then alternative turn based or squad based games, I was looking forward to another game that would be good, instead I got this and I requested a refund, hopefully that goes through."

529450,I Know a Tale,"(Note: My long playtime is due to me actually falling asleep during it. This is NOT a 10-hour adventure game, even if you're really bad at adventure games.)  This game is so ridiculous that it's on the bad side of 'So bad it's good'. Midway between Plan 9 bad and Star Wars Holiday Special bad. It has adorable bad-movie charm in every respect- bad translation, bad plot, bad acting, exceptionally low production value, the fact that there are live-action cutscenes in this kind of adventure game at all- but it's clearly not tested very well."

530290,The Planet of the Vicious Creatures,"I really enjoyed the graphics, sprites and music of this game. Sadly it's also HARD AS ♥♥♥♥, be prepared to make pixel perfect jumps constantly.  Quick Look:  https://youtu.be/oLIQnnWLozs "
530330,Blameless,"This was way better than I anticipated. The puzzles were thought out pretty well and the story left my heart racing whenever I turned a corner. The ending did kind of ♥♥♥♥ me off, but overall, a good game :)"
530360,Requiescence,"So I must admit that this is truly a remarkable visual novel.   At first I was sceptical because the background art - not to say cheap - gave off the impression that it wasn't refined, respectively given much thought into. It hardly gave off the vibe of being edited much or something. After an hour or so I realised though that it was just right. It is darkish and grey, blurry and it complements the music, the story and the whole mood just fine. How the developers played with the transitions and everything and worked with what little - or so it appeared - they had... it's just unbelievable.   The music gave of the right vibe. I'm not by any means a professional but I think how the music made me be a little bit on edge the whole time while being impatient for what was to happen next and feeling anxious at the same time was just right.   Now about the story... It's well written and gives you a good read. I enjoyed the first playthrough and even though I'm mostly satisfied I'm thinking about playing through all the routes though I think there isn't that much left to it. But I might be wrong... I can't say just now. I just found the character development interesting yet intriguing.   I pursued Carrault because I found him the most interesting of them all. He was so full of anger and sadness at the beginning but slowly he was gaining trust. He comes of as incredibly narrow-minded when he's really caring and accepting. You can see that how delicately he acts around the fox in the snowy forest.   I can imagine all of the possible love interests  being special and interesting in their own way. The writer obviously did a good job in my opinion.   And don't get me even started on Absalom... He's a somewhat strange antagonist... I myself am not entirely convinced he even is. The way the monk laughed in the end... maybe he was the mastermind behind it all? Or he's just gone nuts? We don't know!    What's more? The 'partial' voice acting was well done... Though.... I found it a little bit amusing... Because most of the lines had voice acting... but some just didn't. The producers might have done this on purpose but it's perfectly possible that something else got in the way... I can't say that I really see why this would be, in any way, a reasonable act.   All in all I must say it was a good purchase and I'd recommend it to all the visual novel lovers out there. I'd even recommend it to those not neccessarily interested in gay romance. The romance is a nice plus but there's way more to this story than that."
530390,Slayaway Camp,"Fun puzzle game with a cool 80s horror theme. Consists of about 10 'movies', each with a dozen or so levels (plus bonus levels). At the start of each movie a new puzzle mechanic is introduced, which adds to the existing mechanics. This keeps things from getting monotonous and also provides a gentle learning curve. The game also lets you rewind your moves at any time, so you don't have to redo an entire puzzle if you mess up."
530520,Aegis,This game controls terribly as well as being incredibly boring. The core gameplay loop makes it annoying to move and even harder to fight!  The entire game feels like it was thrown together in a very short time without much thought as to how it would be to play it.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  EDIT: Check out my First Impressions video to see more and decide for yourselves:  https://youtu.be/S1QuZ6jx4tk

Edit: I have now beaten the tutorial and played a bit of the game, and I can say right now, this game is hard as ♥♥♥♥. Not JUST the enemies and figuring things out, but also the fact that the game is a big maze. But once again, we know why people REALLY play this game..."
530920,Archimedes,It's a neat little ARG game with a decent story and fun puzzles.
530960,ROM: Extraction,"This is a pretty fun game. I nice change from your typical wave shooter. The tutorial does a great job of teaching you how to play and the controls are great on the Vive. The visuals are impressive and the effects are eye candy. The physics are great as well, and throwing the orb thing feels accurate and polished.  The game could use more content, such as different modes or levels. You play in the same space each and every game, so having other places to play at would be great. (a jungle maybe? :P)  My overview:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-BJ7LZEgwI "
531070,The Tower - Fantogame,"This is barely a game. You have to click a block in each row of the tower. If you get one wrong, you start at the bottom and try again. When you reach the top, you are told how many attempts it took. That is it. After perhaps thirty seconds I had seen all the game had to offer.  I had to idle the game for a few minutes in order to post this review. Leaving the game running in the background was more fun than playing it."
531110,Battles of Norghan,"This game is somewhat like ogre battles and its basically a strategy combat game. The controls could be better but the RPG system is kind of ok. The game also has some bugs and can crash without warning sometimes.  The game is pretty linear so if that's not your cup of tea then stay away. You basically try to murder your way though different divisions agains opponent clans while equipping and training your troops. Some of the battles after the first few divisions can get pretty fun, but I don't think most people will ever get to experience them. I only recommend this game to people that know what they are getting themselves into - it's definately not for everyone.  It was a long time since I played it actually, it's also kind of easy to break the balance of the game if you know what you're doing. Ogres can get absolutely overpowered if their intelligence is trained early, minotaurs are the best fighters in the game and a combo of ogres, minos and spellcasters will break almost anything the AI clans will ever throw at you - It's really that simple.  Don't know why the publishers would release this game now other than gaining some extra cash from a half-baked fighting game."

531200,Beneath The Cherry Trees,"While very short, this visual novel is hilarious mostly due to its quaint translation from Japanese into English. Somewhat graphic in parts, it's certainly a memorable experience.  See gameplay  https://youtu.be/Dz0j44JXFhA "
531240,Max Stern,"This game had potential. The art direction is nice, but the game mechanics ruin the majority of the game itself. It's only redeeming value that allows the game to be played all the way through is Save States are enabled throughout the levels. I really don't understand why the Developer doesn't say the game has 20 levels with the 21st being a simple 'Hey, here is your ship!' bonus. I was dreading the game by stage 8 and powered through just to see how long the game is. Took me two hours.  I encountered no bugs/glitches, with several typos and grammatic errors as well as sentence structure problems (almost like this review; soz) Overall it's bland, frustrating, and drags on too long for what it currently offers in the levels provided.  The opponents shoot farther than the player with their projectiles, so every fight is the player sneaking up on the enemy, shooting once or twice and running away as the monster shoots overpowered projectiles.  There are several areas in the game that are designed for the player to lose health, such as enemies having short walkways so you can't setup traps and can't run past them to climb up ladders, forcing a shootout. Also, quite a few troll spots in the game where hidden levels are enabled by jumping on blocked shutes, but the majority of the time, they just drop you far enough to lose health on landing. Once again, thank goodness the game has save states.  Speaking of the saving grace known as Save States, weapons do random damage, meaning sometimes this one robot that does 30 damage out of your 100 health in 1 second can take 3 grenades instead of 2 and if they need 3, you'll lose about 20 health.  Finally, you can only climb ladders when not moving, making it even harder to avoid enemies. Initially I was wondering why it took 2-3 seconds to start climbing ladders until I noticed that."

531730,Corona Blossom Vol.2 The Truth From Beyond,I really love the characters and of course the 'FAN SERVICE' :P  10/10
531740,Rubek,"It's an okay game, the isometric view makes it seem a little more interesting. It's challenging enough, but the controls are often the biggest challenge for me. But while I can eventually get used to the controls, I'm more bothered that the game has no windowed mode. And the windowed mode you can force is incapable of being resized, meaning I can't actively play this game and watch someone stream at the same time.  So no I don't recommend this game. But if the controls and lack of windowed mode don't bother you, then this is a pretty nice puzzle game to grab some of your time.  P.S. And to further clarify why a lack of a windowed mode bothers me so much, my only screen is 20''. :/ The forced window mode takes up almost the same amount of space as before."
531860,Where's My What?,"First of all, I got this game for free from somebody giving out a free mystery key.  Although I don't find myself an avid fan of hidden object games, I figured I would try this game out rather than just letting it run for cards. After a bit of gameplay, I have a number of complaints.  First of all, the classifications are awful. What are 'Faster Things'? It appears the only things under that category are vehicles, so why not just say that? 'Sharp Objects'. Alright, I'll click this sharpened pencil over here. Wrong. According to this game, Cars and Boats smaller than the size of a cat are also not 'Toys', which doesn't make a particular lot of sense.  Another issue I have is how repetitive levels get. Every round, you get the exact scene with the objective 'Find [previous round's amount of objects + 1] in X seconds.' I can see it difficult for a Hidden Object game to keep itself interesting, but absolutely nothing changes between rounds aside from a few more objects on the screen.  Speaking of objects on the screen, you have to scroll throughout the level to find them. This terrible in itself, but each round adds more objects meaning a longer scroll time. I would rather just look at one single frame with objects shruken down to an appropriate size.  Ultimately, this game isn't worth its base price. Even if it went on sale for 90% off, you could still find cheaper games for trading card farming or even buy a better hidden object game."
531890,Guardian's Oath,"  I don't think I'd pay for it, but I got it for free and at this price range it's a decent little RPG. Although I had to change my keyboard layout to QWERTY to play it properly."

There is no better word for it, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. How come that I am, the mighty hero, the dragonslayer, getting eaten by a ♥♥♥♥ing ant over and over again???? How come an experienced man that lived underground for years and who is strong enough to smash three people at a time with his sledgehammer can't kill A ♥♥♥♥ING ANT???? This game is absolutely irrational and I'm not even one of those people who hate on a phantasy game/movie for being alogical. Do not recomment to play this game, it sucks balls."
531960,Bloody Walls,"Fun game when you know the controls and I love the metal soundtrack, it makes it seem more badass."
531990,Egg Time,"A pretty cheeky little game where you have to get a bunch of eggs into a container. Sounds pretty stupid at first but it's pretty fun especially with the special eggs and abilities. One bad thing though was that in the second level I couldn't get to the container as it was beyond my playspace, but the first level was pretty good.  Overall I have to give this 6 barns out of 9, would recommend to HowToBasic again :^)"

It does not matter for me if the asssets were made out of paper, but what matters for me is the atmosphere and this game has ATMOSPHERE indeed. There are very nice moments of discovering the train, there are surprising moments with puzzles and events. It is like an unfishished dream which I can dream/play further. The controlling system is sometimes point'n'click but often enhanced by more interesting controlling mechanics. The trailer is honest and demostrative."

532700,Finque,"All I can say is that Finque must be tripping to get a dream like that. All the camera spinning already drive my head nuts.  For a 3D puzzle-platformer, this one need serious polishing, especially on the camera control. Is hard to get a perfect view for each puzzle, and when you do get a good view, it will end up reset itself when it got too close to a platform. Is near impossible to finish this game without a better camera option.  Unlike the most puzzle-platformer, there is little replay value. You must reach the finish area with all the crystals, so rather than a perfect score or a not perfect score, once you finish it, you will not want to do it again. Second, even if you do want to do it again, there is no option for it, I mean, when is the last time you play a puzzle game with no level selection?  There is also few others aspect in this game that need much improvement, but for the offering price, I won't push too far. "

533690,Think To Die,"What it says on the box.  Some clunky controls, but a great premise with hilarous results."
533780,Zombie Defense,"I'm really enjoying this tower defense game. Yes it's basically a tower defense game where you place your recruits in strategic locations and go to town killing as many zombies as you can. There's 5 modes of play with each pregressivly harder, each mode has the same 48 stages with anywhere between 5 and 20 rounds with each round harder (more zombies).   You do earn 'game money' to buy upgrades to help out with later stages. There's no penalty going back to play a stage you finished earlier to get extra currency so you you go and purchase that all important upgrade you're missing. However, you can pay real money to get in game currecy to boost your upgrades faster."
533820,Atonement 2: Ruptured by Despair,"I really enjoyed this game. I just finished playing the first one just before the sequel came out. I thought this was an excellent continuation of the first story. Since this game seemed longer than the first, I liked having the second team incorporated into the flashbacks as opposed to having to play the entire game again with a second team. I thought having your decisions in the flashbacks directly impact your game play in present day was a perfect way to encourage replay. Of course, the music once again was above board. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone and look forward to any potential sequels!"
533850,EggK47," https://youtu.be/CX8mX5ChEI4   A chicken with a gun and nothing to lose sets out to find an incomprehensible number of missing golden eggs, in order to move onto the next level in order to find more.  The basic controls suffer due to the default alignment of the avatars moving and shooting. Aiming and ?flying? are constantly hindered due to the lack of vertical offset that results in constant collisions with the immediate terrain. This oversight requires the player to keep their camera looking up to compensate for the aiming but doing reduces their ability to see in front of them.  Also infinitely spawning enemies combined with limited ammo and a ridiculous number of collectables to progress is a terrible time."
533890,ReBoot,"There's a lot of potential here, but there are a few annoyances that really hindered my experience.  Pros: + The movement feels good and fluid + Weapons are fun to use (when they respond to your input) + Music is good + Enemies are varied enough + Making an enemy explode and having its torso fly up and hit the screen feels really cool. + There's a lot of good stuff here for such a cheap game  Cons: - The aiming needs work. Aiming at enemies sometimes makes the red laser-sight jitter up and down and bullets just fly off randomly. - The red cursor is WAY too small and blends in to the environment too much. I shouldn't have to search the screen for it after dodging a bunch of rockets. If the cursor was more visible, then using your periferal vision to aim and focus on your character to dodge stuff would make the gameplay feel much better and smoother. Either making the laser sight a solid red line, or the red cursor more opaque/changed to a larger crosshair would definitely help. Maybe even allowing us to change the color of the cursor. - Mouse input is buggy and, while I'm pressing down and trying to shoot... sometimes it just won't respond. Holding down the fire button, letting go and firing again sometimes would result in a 2-3 second delay before you start firing (this is for the regular primary gun, not the one that overheats). Once I even had a bunch of lasers and rockets but NONE of them would shoot at all, and I was stuck with an overheated minigun which just takes way too long to cool down. - The blue laser enemies feel cheap and just stun-lock you and kill you the moment they show up in the corner of the screen. (This is a small annoyance, sure you can memorize their locations after a few runs and avoid them easier) - Getting stuck on pieces of the terrain on the floor, or a broken part of a building is really annoying and doesn't feel like it should happen. - No way to change options when you're in the game, you have to end your mission and go to the main screen to change things like sound or video settings. (I didn't know how loud the game would be so I started a mission, it was too loud, so I tried to change the sound but had to end the mission to do so)  If it wasn't for the first 3 negative points, I would have recommended this game easily."

534230,Quell 4D,"Updated review: So after trying the new patch I definitely feel like it's going in the right direction and I would recommend this game due to the hard work the dev has put in. I haven't quite figured out the mechanic in it's entirety yet. It seems like I've still been hit when position wise it feels like my head isn't near the projectile and the bullet seems to follow you on the initial flash of their gun. It's possible to dodge, but the timing feels off at long distances. From reading other comments I feel like something might still be off with my play space since I still have to extend my arm all the way out to get full speed and it does still stop when changing directions.          Old Review:  I would highly recommend holding off on this game until it sees a few more patches. Aside from a the gun angles of the shotgun and uzi being uncomfortable, the biggest problem this game faces is it's movement system. I came to realize that the game doesn't actually recognize when you move your body out of cover, the ai detects you based on the slime moving out of cover. This is where the biggest problem arises. You can take easy pot shots on enemies without them being able to see you, but the catch side is they can still hit you even though you feel like your body is behind a wall. If the edge of the slime pool is sticking out, you can get hit. If you're used to something like onward where you can use both the trackpad and body movement to get out of situations, you're in for a nasty surprise. This is probably the biggest thing that takes me out of the moment in game, having to constantly be looking down at the floor to make sure I'm all set before moving into the next room. This also makes the comparisons to doom 95 and quake not really all there. Those games were all about fast movements and fast frags while Quell's system constantly gets stuck on walls and stairs. If they ditch the slime mechanic and go with a trackpad/full scale movement, I'd highly recommend it because right now if you want a corridor fps."

535700,3D Chess,"  I received this product for free for reviewing purposes. This has in no way altered or affected my review.  TL;DR I wish there was an 'okay' button, because that's what 3D Chess is. Just okay. It doesn't stand out or offer much in comparison to other chess games.   As said, the visuals are great, but there's not much variety with only 4 environments.   Each environment has no music, only a sound effect which loops (Volcano-bubbling lava, Ancient Rome?- fire crackling, and Graveyard-typical spooky sounds). I was expecting the game to have some great music, hence the trailer, but there's no music at all in the game. The sound effects are stock and get so repetitive that I end up just muting it.   Gameplay is just like classic chess, and works well. You can play against the computer or another player on the same screen. Computer has 3 difficulties-easy, normal, and hard. There are also 2 other game modes- puzzles, which you have a limited amount of moves to complete 1 of 3 objectives (checking opponent's kind, avoiding check, and checkmating opponent's king), and chaos mode, where the computer plays randomly. Chaos mode is good for beginners to practice chess without repercussions.  What really irks me though is no online compatibilty. You can't play against another person, unless they're in the same room, but in that case, you may as well just play with an actual chess set.   Point being, there are other chess games on Steam that have more features and online gameplay. Only get this if you want to practice or play against the computer."

This behaviour should be banned, the point is to evaluate the game, not complain about it not running well on YOUR rig. I played with win7 and everything's ok.   Back to the games themselves  : Overall, they're nice if you're into this kind of game, and have played Uplink, Hacknet, Hacker Evolution and others, and crave for more.  Blue sky  is the ancestor of all others and feels that way, but still enjoyable.  Digital Hazard  is one of the best of the four, good story and evolved interface for a good time.  BS Hacker  is not bad and seems like a lower version of the other very good one :  BS Hacker Unlimited . This one is the longest and the more developped, with all features from the previous ones. It announces Hacker Evolution but still with the almost unlimited bouncing which I prefer vs the limited bouncing in HE which make it more like a puzzle.  TLDR : Good hacking games in the console style, especially Digital Hazard and BS Hacker Unlimited to me. At that price it's a steal if you're into these kind of games. "
536530,Marlene Act 1 Betwixt,I have played this several times but only get stuck in the first building. Very frustrating with no obvious way to advance in the game. No sense of what the game is about and what I am trying to accomplish. This is frustarting and just get stuck in a couple of rooms with no way out. That is nad enough but again no flow here just a couple of spooky dudes and scence. They do not make anysense - is there a story? is there a game? is this a 5 minute walk around to get stuck in a building?
536630,Maze Sounds,"Where the sound is coming is too unclear. As result we have are inadequate difficulty of the game. The idea is interesting and new, but the implementation is bad. I did not finish the 1st level even. Progress too slow and gameplay unsatisfying. Also here is no options present except resolution and overal quality. Nothing more! No mouse invert, no keys rebind, no sound options. I am not on WASD and with inverted mouse so playing this was even more painful. Game seriously lacks a lot of features. They need to do more work on it."

536680,Miniature - The Story Puzzle,"If you get this game in a bundle or for &lt;$2, it's just about worth the 30-45 minutes it takes to play it. There are 12 scenarios, each of which have 5 mostly static scenes that you can rotate around in 3D and then put in sequential order. When you do, it shows them to you again in order and you go to the next. If you get it wrong (once I switched two scenes), it shows you which ones were right so you can fix the rest. That's it, you're done, back to the menu.  Someone went to a lot of trouble to make these cute 3D scenes in the Unreal engine. They are charming, and a few illustrate interesting potential stories that you can imagine going on, but two or three seem totally throw-away, such as one with harvesting on a farm and one with a goal in a soccer game.  It's kind of clever, but not really worth paying money for, and it's very easy and short with no replay value at all. Sorry."
536750,BoomTown! Deluxe,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME, SLOW, BORING MAYBE MY 7 YEAR OLD WILL LIKE IT!  NOT A LITTLE FUN-OR ENJOYABLE- TOTALLY UNAPPEALING!"
536780,Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom,"I love Artifex Mundi games - but this is the worst one I have played. The puzzles are way too easy, and the story is simple but disjointed. It felt very rough and unpolished. A somewhat fun but very forgettable few hours of play."
536920,Groggers!,"I really like this game and the whole drunk concept. Good cute graphics and i love the sound track. Really fits the game. Think of a drunken frogger like game. Needs just a few little tweaks here and there and it will be perfect. Game hung up a few times after playing it for awhile but nothing major. I would like to see some holiday dlcs for this game. Halloween, Christmas etc. How about a drunk Dracula and Santa? Haha and a few drunks sitting outside the pub just for fun. Also you really need a controller for this game. Its not happening with a keyboard. Anyways i hope the Devs keep working on this game. Its a lot of fun and i plan on playing it a lot more this weekend!! :)"
537050,Bric,I think this game has great potential but it does need a little bit more work. The game needs for features to get people more interested like power ups and maybe multiplayer support. It should also add controller support and different levels but for the most part I really do enjoy this game and hope the developers keep working on it.
537060,MagixHome VR, Early Access Review
537130,Red Spider: Vengeance,"A well written visual novel. Overwhelming, visual novels on Steam are poorly translated from another language and difficult to read. Not the case here. Lots of Mob intrigue and possibly a murder.  Make up your own mind with this gameplay:  https://youtu.be/K0-f0GQ1RGc "
537180,Digimon Masters Online,"The english could use improvement, it's not perfect by a far margin.  The gameplay has so far been somewhat amusing. It remains to be seen how end-game is.  For a f2p game, I however, highly recommend it.  EDIT.  First day server crashed Second day I lost the items I paid for due to rollback Third day I once again lost the items I paid for and also lost the evolutions I used paid items on.  Getting frustrating. Fix your ♥♥♥♥, or don't push out a game to steam when you're not ready. Not recommended until this stability and bugginess is fixed."

538170,Raging Titan,  Raging Titan is a lot of fun for me! I've played serveral TD games but this one really got me. You can feel how much effort and heart the Dev puts into this game.  I could test Raging Titan ins its beta and I will definitely keep on playing! :)

538590,Sleeping Valley,"Well, if you don't get angry too easily, or even more than too easily, then try and play ;) It's not an easy game, but it doesn't make it great. Graphics style is quite likeable. Handling your character precisely is not possible, so I belive this is the way of making the game harder than it would normally be.  To sum up, I wouldn't pay the whole amount for it, so if you're a serious platformer fan get it when seriously discounted, otherwise look further."
538870,EVE: Valkyrie,How do I agree with the EULA? It says press accept (A) to accept the EULA. But I can't accept it for some reason. Also with the htc vive's controllers it didn't work

539440,Citalis,"I review the mini-management game of Citalis. Does it break ground on a wonderful and deep experience, or does it collapse due to its attempt to simplify the city management genre. Watch and see.           YouTube™ Video:  Citalis Video Review&nbsp;"
539460,Puzzle Cube, Very lazy making. Main file is named test.exe
539640,Racecar.io,"Racecar.io is a Slither.io clone, Keeping to basic principles of classic snake game of old.  Pros: -Free, with easy achievements -Small download size, not taking up too much space on your harddrive  Cons: -Does not offer much in terms of content -Still extremely buggy, with trails not working properly, incosistent connection to servers, point errors, etc.  This game could've been a lot more fun without the bugs, at the moment, not really all that enjoyable. 4/10"
539670,Sakura Nova,loved it played it twice but getting the diffrent ending was hard becouse 9 queston only 2 paths are special and all other 510/512 are the same ending. but its great and   would highly recamened if your a fan of sakura games.
539690,Nanomedix Inc,"Okay, its a TD game, a mobile port to Steam and originally in Russian or something. The tutorial is partially in Engrish, partially in Ruskian and thereby wholly useless. The premise is interesting, but the execution is horribly flawed. Repetitive enemies, hardly anything like strategy required, atrocious camera and camera movement. It feels like you're playing Dr. Mario TD at best, at worst its just prettied-up trash. Even at 99ct its not worth the money or time."
539720,Razortron 2000,ＭＥＭＥＳ
539750,Kombine,"This game has an okay concept. At first it is quite fun, but it becomes horribly repetitive, with big parts of one level being the same, which just ends up making i boring."
539980,Space Cat,"This game is great. It looks great, I love the concept; one thing is that the controls are a bit wonky(although you do get used to them)so it'd be great to configurate your own.   I rate 9/10 :)  Great job."
540020,Final Quest II,a very fun game
540100,Imprisoned Light,  I got this game for me to review it.   The graphics are ****. Its too cluster ****. The game gets boring after 5 minutes and whatnot. It should be a flash game not a game worth 1 dollars.
540410,Queendoom,"This game is intense! It's quite challenging, but very intuitive as well. I really like the game, but I look forward to a bit more diversity in the lanscape. I'm only on level 2 so far, but I'm really enjoying it and look forward to more. The graphics are nice, but a bit gloomy (which I guess is on purpose). It's really diffilcut to get enough money to build your army, but I think more practice will make this easier."
540510,ISLANDS: Non-Places,"Hm. A 'game' where you look at pretty colors and click lights. Felt like there was supposed to be more to it, came away feeling like I wasted $4, really. Like I should have been stoned to enjoy what little it had to offer.  Watching a playthrough on Youtube with a calming voice would have been more worth my time. I don't really recommend this unless you like pretty colors and weird, useless ♥♥♥♥."

540880,Rose of Winter,"Rose of Winter is so cute! I bought it on sale because I finished Hustle Cat and wanted something similar.  Rosemary is precious. I adore her character design and want to thank the creators for making a lead female who's plus sized, has messy hair, and possesses an upbeat attitude. I think Rosemary is relatable and will win the hearts of most players. The princes are standard cliches (strong type, rogue type, playboy type, mysterious type) but they all have personality and don’t necessarily fall flat because they’re stereotypes. Witty dialogue and fun flirty moments abound, I’d recommend you get this game on sale because it can be finished in a relatively short amount of time."
541160,MC Lars: The Video Game,If you enjoy the songs you will enjoy the game. Its tapping your foot to the music but loosing a life if you tap out of time.
541190,Nodiatis,"Ok. I really should have known better.  This game ... Have some issues, lets put it this way.  You start your magical journey, creating YOUR character (picking one random hideous face, out of 4 (from 300+), and one random hideous background (same way). You can change 4 of the images you choosing from (randomly), but 'smart interface decisions' are just starting.  You also should pick one of like 20 classes (standard battle types, mages, etc., and even traders, vampires and angels). I am jumping slightly ahead, but all it changes - one active/passive ability and like + or - 10-20 % to speed of learning particular skill groups (battle, defensive, magick or recovery).  Then you appear in world (like a square) and take small 'tutorial', wich shows you main game loop. It goes like this: You go to some 'region' (by clicking) once or several times. on 'global map'. You fight some monster (stat check). (Click auto atack and wait). (If you will try to be 'mage' - you just need more clicking) You collect 'loot' - some more clicks. You manage inventory space and bring 'loot' back to town. You exchange loot from monsters to skill exp. Rinse and repeat.  On town square (all game is bunch of global square grid) - you click several times to get 'quest' - Kill 5 mobs of collect 5 'bear asses', or kill obligatory 'boss' of region (meatsponge that hit hard). You get more exp, when you done.  Of cause there are some equipment options, with depends on you skill levels and wealth.  And there are like 200+ skills... Good right?  Actually not. You see - all skills can be leveled in two ways. - Active and passive. Active - you choose which particular skill to level (lets say parry), and all exp, you get in its dirrectory (defence) goes to this skill. How do you get the exp? By 'burning' monster loot at 'church'.  There are monster loot for combat skills (mele / archery / defence / pets). There are monster loot for magic (white+green / black / blue)  What about crafting skills? Well - you can craft. Theoretically. Or you can just pick this skill to 'passive' leveling. What passive leveling? You might ask. Oh, it is qute simple.  You pick one (of 100+) skills, and it just slowly grows each second. Even when you are offline. How the hell they will ballance that? You may ask (case there are PvP in game). Oh - very very simple.  Skills do like + 20% to this, or that. At level 100. And +10% at level 0.  To give you most hilarious (for me) example - skill to 'raise up' my 'class proficiency'. My class was adventurer.  At level 0 of 'class proficiency' I get swooping +3% to all exp I get. If I will pick this skill to passive leveling, in mere year, or so, (standart geometric progression in exp, required to level up skill with each of it 100+ levels), I will get ... + 6% to all exp. Neet, right?  Lets talk about biggest 'bugbear' I found, and finish with this topic. Remember how I did say, that there is 'merchant' class? Well - you simply can't sell anything on the auction, if you don't pay devs 'monthly'. People said, that later in game I can buy this 'pass' with ingame money.  I can. It costs millions (at auction at least).  Why this is a big deal? Because of 'Crafting' part of the game.  You essentially need to create 'living production lines', from people, to craft even simplest of thing. And each step will take inventory space and particular skill proficiency.   Example: You killed first boss and got fishing rod. You fished some fish (each attempt, after random battle), and want to do something with it. You can sell it to NPC shop, for like 4 gold.  You can buy a fish skinning dagger and get fish scales, getting + exp in fishing, and then sell them to NPC. You can use fish to make oil (dont know how though).  You can't sell this to people, that are noobs, case they came to 'play for free'. You can't sell this to 'old guys', case they dont need stack of 5 fish scales, from starting location. Your only option - is to sell it to NPC, or just destroy it (case it takes space)  Example №2 You want to craft anything 'from other end'.  You get any 'recipie' - lets say lvl 0 harpoon, from buying it at town, and breaking it apart. You cant even see materals, needed to produse it, case first you need to do - is to make 'working copy' of this 'master recipie', which requires you to get pen (NPC sells it), and also ink, and paper. Of course there are different professions, to produse bouth of this, and I dont even know in which city NPC sells 'tools', to level them (not in first 2, I can tell you for a fact).  Did I mention, that all this information I got, pestering people is chat, and reading forums, case game does not explaing sh*t?  Only possitive thing I can say - 'old' people in chat are super chill and nice, but it is, in no way, a game fault.  Try it 'for free', tread with care, and watch for youself."

541720,Redrum: Dead Diary,"I'm afraid this is so far looking like one of the worst hidden object games I've played yet. It's pretty much just the same thing over and over: if you like PURE hidden object games, no puzzles, no adventure element, then you'd probably like this, and at least the hidden object lists are varied (some get you to search by picture or shape, some by name of the items) but for me this is just repetetive. I also found the 'storyline' parts in between HO scenes pretty badly written, and the general storyline a bit lacking- it seems like the story is just a filler for the HO scenes. I've played 30 minutes and am utterly fed up of it, and doubt I'll go back to it.  "

542120,Win Big Or Die,I have no words to describe how awful this game is...jk I have: this game is   ♥♥♥♥  ! But I have to give you props for not making this game paid.
542170,Edmersiv,"I gave this a recommend because I like what the creators are doing, but I do not agree with their method of delivery.   It's okay. It's a good app to tour and thats the end of it. Kind of like visiting a museum, only more boring than a real museum. I also found a few bugs and kinks that really made it kind of frustrating. I feel like the app needs to immerse people more in the displays it has around. The collosseum was the coolest part; but thats just because I could warp inside of it and look around.   For example, if the cell exhibit would let me highlight certain parts of the cell, and show how they contribute to the cells functioning (animation would be paramount, but even without). Showing how something works is much more educational than just looking at it and having a relatively boring narrarator explain in a very scientific manner how it works.   Don't take me for a fool, either. I learned a couple of things from this app that I didn't already know.  In my opinion, the devs needs to work on method of delivery. Good app anyways, fun to mess around with then never play again. I am not deleting it because I will check it again in a few months, and I'll update the review if the app impressed me more than it did this time."
542260,The Herbalist,"This is one of those games that makes you wish for an option between thumbs-up and thumbs-down. It's not a game you'd enthusiastically recommend, but not one that deserves a downvote either.  So, the deal. This game puts you in control of Slavya, a young woman who went looking to visit her herbalist grandmother only to find her gone, her cabin abandoned, and...well, that about does it for the story. So rather than A) gathering a search party, B) informing the authorities, or C) investigating the disappearance, Slavya elects to D) start fooling around with potion-making. This isn't easy, since Slavya is broke and apparently narcoleptic.  In terms of structure, Herbalist is a likeable-enough recipe-puzzle game. Go find some herbs, see what they do. Odds are you've made something awful and need to try again, but that's part of the fun. For a touch of creativity, all of the plants and recipes are written in a rune-themed text which, if you have the patience, you can decode. It doesn't make a difference, but it's a nice touch. This game can get frustratingly grindy, though. The tutorial is very thin, so there's a lot of trial-and-error. It doesn't help that Slavya has less energy than a dead watch battery. You can't do much before she's 'too tired' to consider doing whatever it is you want to do. Yep, picking ten plants just winds her. Of course, she can wake up a bit by playing with her cat, but even that's short-lived. The village shop doesn't need to stock apples - they need to carry some coffee or RedBull because this girl clearly needs caffeine in her life. It's enjoyable enough to avoid a downvote, but not enough fun to warrant a full upvote. Of course, that's just my opinion. Your mileage may vary."
542310,Escape the Game,"This game is a def 10/10 amazing. BUT IT CRASHES EVERY BLOODY MICRO SECOND 0/10 NEVER WOULD PLAY AGAIN (unless da fix it :D)  I was reading reviews like oh it crashes when i troll, so im like oh ill play how he wants mwe to.

542550,Plankton,"This game is like it says, an electronic pet that you keep running either in the background or on a second/third/fourth monitor. it's interactive most of the time, with a couple of times that the feeding just happens.  It's a cute 99 cent game, even though I caught it at a higher price."

542780,Drift GEAR Racing Free,"A track based drifting game quite similar to High Octane Drift, but perhaps with a greater ability to control the vehicle. You need to go through a slalom of barrels on the track, and don't forget to crash into the wall a few times. The crowd are 'paper people', which will detract from the realism for some, but good graphics and realism overall.  Make up your own mind with this gameplay  https://youtu.be/wLVTSBbD9Bc "

543170,Project: R.E.B.O.O.T,this game fun and addicting and here are some things about it.  1 it is a dungeon runner/puzzle game  2 it has good music   3 it is only $0.99 or $0.74  4 if you need more info here is some game play.  5 It's game play is good no glitches very cool fun fast / puzzle   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5_CVvRour8  new as of 10/31/2016  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz3xkmxABVY 
543270,Mr. Shadow,A classic Point&amp;Click game with an original art style (between beautiful and crepy).
543350,The Night The Carsons Disappeared,"This game could be a lot more than what it is.  Unfortunately it simply ended up as one of the most boring 'games' where you can't do anything and nothing really happens. Also, those spaced out 'scary' parts are just not enough to keep anyone away from falling asleep.  The voices are great tho."
543360,Relaxation balls,  Controls are funky and no clear end goal in sight. Not sure if this was just a bunch of stuff thrown into Unity. You could basically make this from tutorials in a week.
543530,Holo Impact : Prologue,"In my short play I would say if you like true arcade type VR experiences then this definately will scratch that itch. Good graphics, smooth game play. Anyone can jump right into it and have fun although as it goes it gets harder. I got this on sale for like $6 so it was worth that much I'd say. Buy it and enjoy it.  Short game play here:   https://youtu.be/HtEsNOs4soQ "
543600,Monster Maze VR,"Found it enjoyable. A nice walk in the dark, for its price, is definatly worth it. Game has good visuals, gunsights were on target, so to speak. I especially liked the colors in the underground level. Overall I would say its a good game, but i wouldn't say it is for children, not from a fear factor but because of the ending which i won't spoil."
543650,Last Days, Early Access Review
543980,Zombie Exodus: Safe Haven,Amazing game! Every action you do always ends with a consequence. Highly recommend playing this game.
544130,Whack a Vote: Hammering the Polls,"Terrible game, hardly 30 seconds of play time in this. Would not recommend. Do not waste your time downloading this. The sign in form at the start doesn't work, and it took me forever to work out how to start the stupid whacking game. You can just put the mallets onto the holes and it will whack everything. Losing 10x points from one thing is also stupid."
544140,Murder Mystery Adventure,  It felt so.. immersive.. wow... woah!.. It's too much.
544190,Book Series - Alice in Wonderland,"A very relaxing piece of art, pretty and well made. Music and artwork work together so nicely.  We have audioboks, ebooks and now VN books, I definitey approve of the idea and wouldn't mind getting a collection of my favourite books made into VNs, would be perfect for rereading &lt;3"
544270,The Bellows,Nice story-driven piece that's enjoyable from start to finish. Great work!
544410,Potioneer: The VR Gardening Simulator, Early Access Review
544420,VRCapture,"I've tried to record The lab and Allumette, but it didn't work, I can see only black screen. Later I tried to record Vive Home, it seems fine... I think VRcapture is not that much stable... expecting next update...  不知道为什么录制下来都是纯黑色的画面。完全没法使用~"
544440,Next Stop 2,Based on the first half hour of game play...This game is not fun for adults. Suitable for 3-5 year old age group perhaps. First 30 minutes clicking back and forth on mail packages and trees that a lumberjack collects. I only played that long because I thought soon.. there would be more to it.
544520,The Puppet Master,"Ok so the controls aren't great, like at all. The UI and menu is a mess and sorely lacking. The story could be interesting except it is very light in details to the point where you're sat wondering what is going on and I understand the use of slowly uncovering a story but if you're not connected to the character you just end up not caring.          YouTube™ Video:  I Just Played... The Puppet Master - There are no strings on me&nbsp;"
544530,Escape Bloody Mary,"Escape Bloody Mary VR takes a new virtual spin on the old folk story of Bloody Mary. This game is more of a maintain-ment than an escape game but follows some similar strategies to escape the room games, albeit with a time limit. Whenever BM shows up, you have to do everything in your power to keep all the candles in the room lit and to keep doors and other entryways closed. The game speeds things up a bit with the candle location and lighting mechanic and the final puzzle is a bit straightforward but for $2 this is a bargain of an experience that won’t let you down."
544540,The Fastest Fist,"DISCLAIMER: If you have hit pads before, think carefully before you get this game. If you can, wait for patches that fix the issues.  As another review has said:  'This game has an absolute bare minimum amount of content to be considered a game but I still can't help but enjoy it'  This is a great experience but at this price right now, this game in it's current state is not a smooth experience if you have ever hit actual pads before.   There are 3 main problems: - The trainer animations can feel janky between the different punches. The trainer feels like he resets before putting the next pad up which can make punch combos feel really random, this feels arcadey rather than realistic.  - Blocking doesn't work right now, you can only evade punches. The hitbox for evading punches is not bug free, if a punch just barely clips you, you get the same point deduction compared to a clean shot. - There is just one continous wave based mode. If you lose you have to start at 0 again. The dev needs to add other modes and needs to have wave select.  Another minor problem is that the trainer sometines hold both pads up for you to do rapid right 1-2s. This mechanism makes the game feel so arcadey because if you want to maximise point and get to the next wave the player must throw tap puches rather than proper form punches.  This is only a negative if you are looking for a genuine pad experience rather than an arcadey game.  Despite these flaws, this game is a great workout if you throw your punches properly. That's why i recomment this game. For the first time in the history of man you can do pad work without requiring a trainer.   To the developer, please don't give up on this game! It has so much potential!"
544590,Death Dojo,Nice and intimidating at first but you are too limited as to what you can do. I was hoping for a real battle but you can only dodge and eventually strike when the enemy is exposed in a very specific way. The price was right... I hope they expand this with more functionality in the near future.

544880,Limelight VR,"I wouldn't say it is INSANELY overpriced - you might want to face your fears of public speaking. The ONLY way to do this is through practice. VR allows a full-immersion into an alternate reality. With Limelight, the potential for practicing public speaking is there - a new unfamiliar space with (virtual) people's attention on you presenting.  Set the audience to neutral. The 'positive' audience is silly. There are 3 room sizes - boardroom, classroom &amp; hall. You load your google slides into the presentation for the hall &amp; board room - very neat.  I would like to see more done with this - there's a lot of potential to take this further.  If you're still reading, you probably are trying to conquer your public speaking fear. Here are a few tips: VISUALISATION, VISUALISATION, VISUALISATION! When you prepare a speech, it's not enough to just know it well to eliminate all your jitters - IMAGINE doing the speech AT the venue where you will be speaking. I have done various MC events &amp; before I would get lots of tension. But when you include actually going to the venue &amp; becoming familiar with the environment, you will lose some fear (of the unknown) because you at least know the venue to start with."

545330,AL･FINE,"this game is very bad, it says im out vram when i have tons vram.  and you cant reduce resoulotion on it, and there is no voice on it. just game should be play for free, since its sux and has errors on it"
545470,Hover Hazard,"Personally i think that this game is aimed for the party play - singleplayer is quite easy, because 90% of the levels has *dead zones* where you can semi-afk to get the gold trophy, while in multi where you can kill eachother you wont have a chance to stand still.  Anyway - this game has plenty of interesting mechanics, your spaceship moves like it's really an outterspace not *liquid space*, full gamepad support up to 4 players, and low price. It's not the best but not that bad either."
545580,"GO AWAY, THERE'S KUMIS OVER THERE!",  It's better than Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare  
545690,VOI,"This is a fun game with a nice concept, that really gets you thinking. It's far from being perfect, and I have a  lot  of pet-peeves that I'm going to list soon, but for the price of this game, I'd recommend it.  Here are the pros:  - Straight forward and easy to get;  - Very cheap (as of writing this review);  - Intuitive and interesting.  And the cons:  - This game doesn't have an user interface: you start at the game, no pause: just a button to turn off the music and a button to turn off 'FX' (which didn't seem to make a difference for me). There is no level reseting: you have to switch between levels to restart. No quitting button either: pressing 'esc' toggles windowed mode, and then you close it;  - The 'board' is way too small and finicky, making you have to 'struggle' to move pieces around. Could definitely use a bigger board (or one that wasn't round), or maybe even a 'pocket' to keep pieces you're not using instead of putting them in the corner while solving the puzzles;  - The rendering of the pieces wasn't really that good: some edges would overlap in weird ways. Also, the level number that display in the middle of the screen gets messed up after a while, so you can't really tell in which level you are except for the achievements;  - The gameplay itself is wonky: getting pieces near the edges of the board will make them go back to their original position, even when you've technically placed them still inside the boundaries of the board. This game could also use some sort of piece highlight for when similar pieces overlap and get white: you can actually lose the pieces if you don't pay attention. And even if you do, you can't pick specific pieces when overlaping: the one you get is the one you get. You have to put it aside to get the ones beneath it out (refer to point #2);  - I'm okay with simplistic styles, but when it's so simplistic that you don't have much to do, I don't quite like. This game has too few elements to go on: it's basically play the game or not play the game, no middle ground like a menu or pause, or settings to poke at;  - The puzzles were quite fun, and although this might be because I was lucky/unlucky, the difficulty curve felt rather random after the first few puzzles: some levels were really tough, taking like 5 whole minutes, but the next one could be solved in 10 seconds;  - Last, but not least, the last level just sits there. After you solved it, it doesn't do anything: I genuinely thought the game had bugged out and didn't recognize that I beat the level. It doesn't display any messages or change anything (like going back to the first level or resetting the same). So you may just sit there for a while trying to understand what went wrong.  I think that, given an update to improve some of the points I mentioned would make this game much more worth it. The idea of the puzzles is pretty neat, but if it wasn't for the low price, I wouldn't recommend. Still had plenty of fun with it, it's quite challenging and gets you thinking in all sorts of strategies!"
545960,Wild Animals - Animated Jigsaws,"Just a flash-quality puzzle game with 10 looped animal videos. The pieces click on right placement &amp; are always properly oriented, so you can assemble pics without  even looking at  much effort. The video plays in all the tiles simulteneously, giving you enough clues to guess the right place. I think it's an allright game for kids, still the UI quality leaves much to be desired, it feels rather cheap &amp; unpolished."
546090,Trip to Vinelands,"A very difficult game. Expect to die often. I suspect it might be much easier to play with a gamepad. Based on my keyboard play, moving quickly enough before dying seemed to be very challenging. The graphics seem to be procedurally generated, and are simplistic and retro, which may appeal to some. I'd recommend to the developers an easier start into the game, ramping up the difficulty more gradually. As it stands, it's more dying and not enough enjoyment.  Make up your own mind with gameplay  https://youtu.be/HtME7jLlUNk "

I recently purchased some A grade titles, like Battlefield 1, but I can confirm that NOTHING meets the standards of this mint ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing game. Firstly, in Battlefield you play as a piece of waste, but in Sluggish Morss, you have the option of controlling a furry purple ♥♥♥♥ or a brown ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥er.

547750,Endless Night - Alpha, Early Access Review
547840,Interfectorem,"I was a Kickstarter backer for this game, and I was so pleasantly surprised with how much I loved this game! I actually gasped at quite a few parts. And I love that this was made by little girls learning how to make games at such a young age. Just fantastic, all of it. It's a really funny game, sometimes darkly so. If you enjoy point and click games with more dialogue and story than full on button mashing fighting, you will probably love this."

547900,Front Office Football Eight,I like management games and I looked forward to Front Office Football 8 being realised so i could buy it. It got released and I bought it. 15 minutes in I realised what a mistake I made. Its horrible. But i carried on hoping that I would find what these positive reviews were telling me was so good about it. 4 hours of gameplay in and Ive given up. Its the worst game I have ever come across and I used to own a Vic-20. I'll never play it again and never again will I buy a game off Steam that doesnt have a demo. Front Office Football 8 is the biggest waste of 3 hours wages before tax that I have ever spent. I only wish I bought 4 pints of cider instead of buying this game.
547910,The Survey,Alot of people hail it as a gem well kids its not if you like walking around really slow for some artsy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that is your buisness. So in conclusion it is slow to a criminal degree give it a miss my man get the static speak my name instead you will thank me later.

548080,Space Merchants: Arena,interesting cross-platform online multiplayer game.. I'm going to conquer the the universe soon!!
548110,Star-Twine,"  This a very interesting strategy game. Though it only has 5 buildable structures it is actually deeper than it appears and there's a lot of interesting tactics you can employ with these building blocks. Has a difficulty spike around level 8 in the campaign, the stuff before that is basically tutorial.  If you like this but find it too hard/fast paced you might like Eufloria, it has a vaguely similar feel though much slower paced.  I'm doing a series of videos, in case you wanted to see some gameplay before buying:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ggI8VFXeA "

It's 'fine', just completely unremarkable (really lame ending too). As far as escape the room minigames go, I suggest checking out  I Expect You to Die . That one is probably the best this worthless little genre will ever be, and even still I wouldn't really recommend it to gamers since escaping the room should always just be a minigame inside of a larger game."

549090,Counter Agents,This game is great! I love the artwork and the feel this game has. I ended up talking to the devs at EAE and they are all really nice regular ol' joes who really know how to make an indie game. The game itself is fun to play local multiplayer as well as single player. Most games like this don't come with any 'level editor' mode and I think that this game can really grow as a community. Great game 10/10!
549760,Evolution VR, Early Access Review
549860,One Night Stand,"No history with this subject myself, lol. But I think the game does a good job projecting some real emotions in real life situations. Some of the decisions are just crazy and dismissable, but others make you want to engage further as you investigate the circumstances surrounding the one night stand. A few of the achievements were not intuitive to obtain and required either luck or looking ahead at a walkthrough. My one let down was that you cannot end the story with the hope of something more with Robin. Overall, it was a good game."

550,Left 4 Dead 2,"Somehow, this game doesn't do it for me. I've had people tell me it's a good game, but I'm getting the feeling it might be a bit overrated. I don't know if it's because I'm forced to use a censored version of it, or if I'm just having bad luck in getting into it.  The graphics are good, but the gameplay is somehow not smooth and very uncomfortable. I can't play this game longer than 40 minutes without getting bored of it.  My online experiences have been fine, at least the community is rather nice.  I got it for a reduced price (around 4 Euro) - which I think is a suitable price than otherwise."

55020,Air Forte ,Catastrophic error crash!
550220,Charm Tale Quest,  Charm Tale Quest is a match 3 game where you need to make chains of similar coloured gems just like in 4 Elements. There is a bar at the top right corner that you need to fill by making chains to complete the level. The longer the chain the closer you get to filling the bar. Every now and then you get a level where you have to face against an opponent and you need to fill your bar before he does in order to complete the level. You can use your power ups and some items on the board against him to prevent him from filling his bar first. Overall it's a nice match 3 game that starts easy and keeps getting more challenging.
55040,Atom Zombie Smasher ,"Don't judge a book by its cover. This little gem is one of the best strategy games I've ever played! I especially love the lack of eye-candy, which in this kind of games is just a distraction. Many campaign options and modding capabilities extend the game's longevity, and replayability is assured. Frame rate slows down at times in big cities, but that's not too bothersome."
550810,Abduction Bit,"Although many have tried this past decade Abduction serves as a perfect example  of an early 80's Pizza parlor coin-op  Admitedly, here in 2016, with games like Dark Souls 2 in backlog, I don't think I will be installing Abduction again to see what Phase 6 is like Yet were this 1984 I probably would've dished out $50 in quarters into this game by now...so that deserves some kind of kudos."

551100,Oblivion's Edge,"This game is an INSANE amount of fun! It brings me back to my days of pumping quarter after quarter into machines in the arcade, except with MUCH better graphics. The four different game modes are challenging, especially Minefield mode, where you don't have any offensive weaponry at all and must rely on your defensive armaments to take out your foes. Survival is probably one of the more difficult ones; Classic is more like Galaga/Galaxian/Space Invaders where you can't let the aliens get past you (since you're the last line of defense). Defend is more like a Tower Defense-style mode, where you have to keep your satellites safe for a set time period (thankfully there are turrets to help out).  I already mentioned the better graphics; I think that the artwork on this game is really good. Sound effects are pretty good as well, although unlike the previous reviewer, I didn't have an issue with the music. I thought it fit pretty well. Finally, I would highly recommend using an Xbox controller to play this game; controls are much more fluid.   I HIGHLY recommend this game, especially if you love 1) twin-stick space shooters, and 2) a challenge!!"
551110,WayOut,Fun little game. About an hour or two of content. Really nice and relaxing music.

551520,Last Days of Spring 2,"Don't bother with this. It costs twice as much as the original with seemingly half of the effort put in. The story is bad, the visuals are lazy and the music is so so.   I honestly have nothing good to say about this experiance. There is zero romance in this game at all. The romance paths are horribly done. The most natural and best ending is where you end up alone. Any and all of the romance paths feel totally forced and half ♥♥♥♥♥. One has you hanging out and catching up and the choice you get is to kiss them randomly or do nothing.   This was totally phoned in for a fast buck. I really enjoyed the first game, but this hot steaming mess is not worth your time. This game was so bad I may never buy from this dev again.  AVOID THIS! Check out the full review I did for this on my website below.    http://nardio.net/2016/12/02/last-days-spring-2-visual-novel-review/  "
551580,Goblin and Coins,"Honestly, there's nothing more to add to game description and zelghadis' review, they're both spot-on. Just wanted to give a well-deerved positive review :) It's a steal for this price!"
551690,Counter Fight,"The game itself isn't bad. It's quite fun and hectic, HOWEVER, the area it places you for the game is right at the front of your play area (for me, right in front of a brick wall where my TV is mounted) and when you're handing off the dishes to the customers you have to reach outside of your play area.  Maybe some with larger play areas won't encounter this but I have refunded due to the fact that, without moving very slowly while handing over a customers order, I can't safely play this game. It's unfortunate that the developers did not include an option to change your placement and after researching I have not been able to find any mention of this feature being worked on. If that changes in the future, I will most likely re-purchase. For now, I'll try The Diner Duo."
551720,Unearthed Inc: The Lost Temple,The mine cart level causes extreme motion sickness. It took me several attempts to complete it because I could only play sitting down with one eye closed.
551750,Survival VR,"My specs: GTX 1070/16Gigs RAM/FX 8320/HTC VIVE  I can not give this a thumbs up. Why? Developers need to look at games that already came out the last several months and not simply copy or use the same ideas as other wave shooters. This game is in no way innovative and it is not 'more fun' than any of the other ones. You are on the same level shooting the same zombies wave after wave. The progression is kind and that is the only thing I do like about it. The assets used are not original ones so it is like deja vu. If you want something that is more fun than this I would say Smell of Death for a more adventure shooter experience (free roam) and definately Containment Initiative if you want a thoughtful wave shooter with gun upgrades and maps to choose. My conscience can not recommend this game but if you just have to have every VR game out the price is cheap but you will get what you pay for. Sorry developers but if you had something new and different to add to the wave shooter VR experience I would have surely thumbed you up. I won't refund this game though just in case you do add something worthy. New game modes? A campaign? A change of maps each wave? Original enemies? Free roaming through a city,suburbs and/or subway? I will change my review if the devs innovate and make this much much better than it is now with new ideas and not just a repeat of others .....

552140,CAGE,"This game is SUPER fun to play. Flinging yourself around the map without a care in the world- except for killing your friends. The many weapons add diversity and strategy, and overall the game is a blast. I load it up sometimes just to fly around on my own. It's got a good feeling to it, something many games today lack."
552160,Hade,"Test your mind with this minimalist logic/puzzle game , easy to learn but hard to master, especially as you progress through levels, you're going to fail over and over again, the relaxing music would try and calm you down, as you rinse and repeat, all in good fun."

552770,Speech Trainer," Crashes every time on startup   UPDATE: Changing my monitor resolution to 1080p fixed the problem. Apparently, trying to run the PDF in 4k res breaks the app.   Alright! So, now that I've had a chance to properly try the experience: This really does capture the awkwardness of public speaking. Glad I was able to get it to work. Will be using before every in-class university presentation. A great tool! Adjusted my rating to 'recommended'. Wolf, this is excellent."
553100,Timber! The Logging Experts,i downloaded this for my 3yr old son. but since have never played it becuse its not setup for the steam controller.
553130,Into The Unknown,"I don't really understand the point of this game. You just follow a simple series of instructions...and then the game ends.  Actually the first time I played it, I went out to find the radio mast...then without warning it suddenly got dark...I couldn't see anything, and my health just vanished...then I awoke back in my cabin without explanation.  When it gets dark, the instructions to use Q and E to 'lean' appear on screen. Why? Is leaning something that's best done at night?  The game identifies itself as 'Into The Unkow' which doesn't exactly fill the player with confidence this is a well polished piece of work...  And whose idea was it to use 'F' to USE items?"
553450,The Purge Day,"It's not a great game but for a cheap price it's fun enough, especially if you don't have motion controls/room scale. The Purge Day is a great one to let your friends try out VR without getting into an hour+ game session."
553500,Hex Phase,"Takes a bit to figure out as there is no tutorial and the menu is unreadable, but for a dollar it delivers. Once You figure out the controls ( WASD, Space ) and what the goal is (make complete hexes and align them with the middle hex) it enages enough, I'll probably play at least one more time."
553590,Hot Squat,I wanted to give this challeng a try but it just doesn't work well. I'm not super tall and I feel like I have to curl up into a ball to fit under the obstacles. It forces you to go way out of form to fit in the openings. I tried calibrating but it didn't help at all.  Sorry guys. Looks like a fun challenge with a fun soundtrack.
553610,ArsonVille,"Basically a random tile generator, it plays like a proof-of-concept project; like other reviews say, there's no progression.  Really cool concept with a lot of potential to be a good puzzle game, shame it's packaged so poorly. Hope the developer flushes out the game's features."
553640,ICEY,"Decent action game with some good metagaming ideas.  Music is too small most of the time, won't comment.  Also, some metagaming ideas are a bit repetitive, Yes, the 'Follow the Arrow' part.  But as a Chinese speaker, I really don't like the narrator, maybe it's just preference. A ENGLISH narrator would been much nicer here.  Localization issues, sometimes the subtitles doesn't fit what the narrator is saying(in Chinese that is), other things like when you die, you get that 'You Die' prompt, which should be 'You Died'. These tiny bits make stupid player like me cringe.  But overall, a fair game."

554310,Rage Wars,"This game is just as bad as it looks. For those curious about it, imagine you are in a cloud level of Mario that scrolls the screen, but you have no way of falling off the edge. The enemies will spawn on either side of you, but the money (or potatoes) that they drop will still roll off, making it hard to collect them all. The story feels nonexistant and feels as though it was inspired by 2010 9gag comics based on how it was written. At no point should anyone consider buying this game, unless it is as a horrible gift for someone that you hate."
554470,BladeShield,"Good game for the price. There are a few similar games out already, this ones pretty polished though. I will say that the difficulty is a little hardcore early on, with tons of different types of enemies attacking you at once. I found that by constantly moving your head (like boxers do) works well for such waves. I somehow got to wave 28 by doing that. Anyways, pretty fun game!

554680,Crazy Saloon VR,"Just played through the game, It's pretty similar to the lab in that its an arcade like game with lots of minigames within the game itself. The games were darts, bartending, shooting, worming(?), slingshotting... I did a youtube review of the game with the conclusion that its an okay game, not sure if its worth 10 dollars, but It was fun with a couple issues with the dart game defaulting to left handed play and the worm game looking pretty weird. Check out my youtube video if you want to see gameplay for yourself...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSB-0ZO5jUs "
555060,Final Soccer VR,Fun game for me and my son who is a soccer player. I can keep up with in in here though. Simple and fun for anyone to play with room scaling. Its a game you can jump into quickly and turn it off when you are done. No complicated maps or in depth soccer knowledge needed. I totally recomend this game with a D-Lux seal of approval.
555180,InfinitasDM,"I was part of the Kickstarter project for this application, I have it on my MacPro via Steam and on my iPad Pro. Works great on my MacPro when using my AppleTV to send the Player's view to my TV screen. The creators listens to all our questions and concerns. It's the beginning of something awesome! The iPad Pro won't mirror via AppleTV but through Chromecast, not a big deal for me but would have been cool.    Being able to take photos of a map from your camera and uploading it is awesome. Can't wait to see how this app looks in the future."

555570,Infestation: The New Z,"tried to try the game, everytime got spawn killed immedietly after joining the server and had to spend ages trying to rejoin the game. In conclusion i spend more time on loading screens than in actual game more p2w and not friendly to people new to the game"
555610,Gunmetal Arcadia Zero,"Although the game brings Zelda II to mind when looking at the trailers, it did not feel like much like Zelda II. I say that as a compliment, though, because I did not have a good time with Zelda II in my childhood. It's more like a cross between Castlevania and Mega Man, in that you strike torches for items, have 'boss rooms' with distinctive doors/borders on either side of some of them, and get three lives, with the mid-boss as a checkpoint unless you lose your lives, in which case you have to restart from the beginning of the chapter.  This game is made to look like an NES game, which it pulls off rather well. I do question the choice of having NPCs matching their room color, though. Zelda II and Megaman usually make their NPCs stand out better, color-wise. The music sounds authentic in keeping with that goal, too. However, my problem with the game was that its gameplay was determined to be like an NES game, for better or for worse. The difficulty was fairly easy until I hit a room with floating red skulls that zig zag up and down while moving toward you from both the left side and the right side of the screen at the same time. This is immediately following a mid-boss of chapter 2.  Getting there isn't so bad, but without a permanent checkpoint at that point in the level, it adds several minutes to each run, failing to entertain me during this down time because I'm making no progress and nothing interesting is happening until I reach the part I died at again. At that point, what I do finally matters, except that the eight hits I can take (I have 4 hearts and each hit costs half a heart) simply don't matter, because one hit from those skulls knocks me down into a pit and I die instantly.  The area I'm at has pits throughout, and I thought to myself 'rushing is making it worse, because I can't see a skull spawn in to dodge it. I know! I'll be smart about this and inch forward.' I do that, but soon realize that even if I don't move, new skulls spawn in. Okay...'This time, I'll destroy all the skulls.' I kill about 4-5 of them and realize it seems they're infinite. I try to inch forward while killing them as I go to avoid getting knocked down in the pit by a skull spawning on the right, and I wind up on a platform with two of those Megaman disappearing/reappearing blocks.   The blocks phase back into existence, and now it's impossible for me to get back up. All I can do is jump left or right, bopping my head on the phase blocks, which sends me falling to my death again, making me restart the chapter as I'm out of lives. I had even spent my in-game money on (and equipped) and jump height increase piece of gear, and I still couldn't jump high enough to make it over those phase blocks, leaving me stuck and waiting to die.  If the rest of the game stays at this pace, or steps it up to become harder (the latter seems most likely), then I could see people who enjoy games that have abusive difficulty liking this game. However, I do not like getting aggravated by not only having to redo the same part repeatedly due to one-hit kills despite doing my best and even applying different strategies to the problem. Having to redo earlier parts of the level after every 3 deaths simply compounds the frustration.  If that's not an issue for you, then you might like it, but if it is, then you may wish to steer clear of this title as I am."
555630,A Magical High School Girl,"Solid game with a simultaneous turn-based system (similar to roguelikes). It is an RPG with a level system where the protagonist gets stronger as she explores the dungeon. Death removes your consumable items but your stats and magic remain. Other then staves (which you don't lose on death), there isn't really equipment in this game.  Gameplay is pretty fun. The majority of your deaths are going to be your fault because you messed up or didn't prepare adequately. Interestingly, all spells in this game are cast from health. You have MP, which is used for your spells, except if it hits 0 you die. I've gotten trapped several times without enough mana to cast anything and died. I've also cast a spell that brought my life down too low and failed to kill the enemy and then I got hit and died.  The spell system lets you create spells and name them, and the name determines the kind of spell it is. Putting 'Red' or 'Star' in the name gives you a fire-element spell, putting 'Beam' or 'Arrow' causes the spell to be an attack that shoots out in a straight line in front of you. It doesn't have that much variety and you'll probably see everything a few hours in but it's a pretty cool mechanic.  Story/writing is basic and there isn't much. I wish there was more, as I liked some of the dialogue in the game and there's plenty of unexplored ideas in the setting like the origins of the witch world and the background of the other NPCs. Translation seems fine, the spell naming system works well and there aren't any bad typos or grammar errors that I can see.  I would have preferred a manual or ingame bestiary that explains what the elemental weaknesses are. As it is, they get mentioned once or twice but not in too much detail and you have to figure most of it out yourself. They also say machines are weak to electricity but the only machine in the game is the tank which is a powerful late game enemy that didn't seem to be particularly vulnerable to electricity (or anything else really).  Music only has like one or two simple tracks that repeat all the time, so not good, though the ending credit theme is a vocal song which sounds nice.  Overall, a good game, relatively short and simplistic but worth trying if you're interested."

555650,"Love, Guitars, and the Nashville Skyline","Full Disclosure: I only played 7 minutes of it and didnt really pay attention. But do note, that it was a boring and tedious 7 minutes, even WITH the girl in her underwear scene. I would only play this game if you liked Adult visual novels a lot, if not, this is a NOPE.  Checkout my real short video here:  https://youtu.be/NLOZFJcrf0c "
555710,Zolg,"I got a coupon for 75% pff this game, so I got it got about a quarter. It's simple and fun. Plenty of games do it bigger, better and flashier. The game is fun though, the aesthetic is consistent, and the music is good. Nothing I heard became grating, like some jingles can. Overall, Zolg is a bang for your buck if you feel like a retro atari style game. I enjoyed it. It also seems like the enemies move in time with a section of the music, which I found visually pleasing."

556280,Neon Prism,"It's very rare I write bad reviews but this game is just time wasting annoyance.  Yes i got it for like 30 cents and ih has a good soundtrack and I don't want to dump on indie devs but it's just not worth it. The only good thing is to get some easy achievements and some steam levels I guess, but there are 5 stupidly dificult levels and the other 45 are just a filler I don't even understand whats the point of them. If you really like pain-in-the-♥♥♥ start-die-repeat games then by all means try it. The sequel is better though."

Game crashes on full screen Game does not save your screen resolution size and resets too the smallest resolution UI buggs out and you can't select anything  In game can be worse once you can even get in game.  Units not reviving AI path system centered on one point in the map making it difficult to grow your army Units getting stuck on objects. more crashing  The game has a lot of issues with it and would not suggest buying until the developer fixes them. It really kills the experience in playing."
557630,Hello Charlotte,"I really loved the first episode which is free. I recommend to play that or you will miss a whole bunch of plotpoints in this one.  The second episode is even greater, with more gore elements, unique puzzles and I'm gonna point this right out: this game is gonna EFF with you mind A LOT!  Enjoy the roller coaster ride! And be careful with the soap!"
557700,Empyrean,"Really enjoy the game :3 I've only done one playthrough and I definitely plan to do more in a attempt to get all the achivements, another good edition to Choice of Games, I would highly reccommend this. Of course many might not like it for the whole text-based adventure and no graphics but I disagree, these are games that I can jump into quickly, have a fun time and not need to wait for things to load.  10/10"
557780,Atom Fishing II,"Installed it, selected english, no idea what's going on because just about everything is in Russian. I don't mind Russia or Russians, I love Russia, my wife is Russian, but I can't speak it, neither can 99% of steam users, so releasing this game in Russian only seems kinda stupid."
557890,Sunset's Ashes,"I definitely would recommend to play this game. The story is short(it actualy takes about a half of an hour to finish reading it) but very touchable, cg works are AWESOME, music realy helps to create the atmosphere, as well as the snow particles. And it's free too."
558660,it's always monday,"This game was ok. I wish there were more ways you could interact with everything and different places you could go in the office and such, but it was ok for a free walking sim. You could get this and explore the office and do everything to make the 5 days go by. It's not a bad experience."
559010,Cosmic Sugar VR,"This game is great, more color options would be awesome though."
559450,Demented Pixie," Demented Pixie  is a visually unique rogue-like game in which you take a role of a crazed pixie. Thrown in a deep dungeon for supposedly being crazy, you have to make your way out. It's never that easy, though!  It's not easy, but it's not frustratingly difficult, either.  The learning curve is pretty smooth, as the game introduces more dangerous enemies as you progress. One of the things that really stand out is an element of strategy - unlike many similar games, the enemies, and especially the bosses, in  Demented Pixie  have various attack patterns, so you won't be just blindly spamming your attack (although that works on some enemies too!).  Another feature that requires some thinking is the inventory grid - the pieces of equip are shaped like a simple jigsaw, so you need to fit them together. And with the wide variety of passive abilites, you can really mix and match the equip to fit your playstyle. Nothing too complex though, so don't worry - there's plenty of shooting to be done ;)  One thing that some players might dislike is the amount of visual effects. Your pixie, enemy pixies, all the projectiles, particles falling down for some added atmosphere... it's pretty to look at, but it gets a bit overwhelming at times. Also, accidentally stepping on teleporters can screw you up, as they teleport you into another room instantly which is not always a helpful thing. And trust me, it's easy to accidentally step on one.  All in all, I'm very impressed by the amount of effort that obviously went into this game. Everything works more or less how it should, found only a few minor glitches, nothing big or gamebreaking. Developer is active on the discusion and fast to act in case you'd encounter a bug, which is always a big plus.  Recommended."
559850,Time Tenshi 2: Special Edition,"Alot of VN's of the 'ecchi' kind have great visuals, but skimp on the plot (story plot mind you), but this VN has both pleasing visuals and a deep, engrossing story. Nothing against the Sakura games (ive played them all, and loved them dearly), but its nice to have a good plot, with the plot. Highly reccomend any fan of VN's to pick this up."
561190,Bamboo EP,"Would definitely recomend this game to anyone, as long as they can handle a little difficulty. The entire package has an colorful and pleasing look to it.   As for the games contained there is Bamboo Ball is a fun/unique enough sports game with a little bit of challenge. Bamboo Moon is a enjoyable and relaxing title screen swimming experience. Bamboo Heart is a surprisingly deep and stands out to me as a game that I want to keep playing. I would definitely recommend this game just for Bamboo Heart as it itself is well worth the price of the game. OH there's also Bamboo Duel that you can unlock and play a 2-4 person multiplayer version of Bamboo Heart.  Bamboo Heart is a Katana Dueling side scrolling action game that is challenging but rewarding if you learn the mechanics and tricks. With quick, snappy controls, surprisingly deep combat, multiple character unlocks, and 'boss' enemies spawning in different orders the game feels incredibly replayable. I want to go back to this game occasionally just because it feels incredibly satisfying. (PS: Please make more of this?)  As for performance there does seem to be something wrong with Bamboo Heart. While there isn't anything noticable at the start, once kills start to rack up (around 50+) the game can slow down significantly. Besides that it ran very well."

57620,Patrician IV: Steam Special Edition,"Stuck in the past - too much micromanagement, tedious UI. Could as well play the original DOS Version."
57640,Broken Sword 1 - Shadow of the Templars: Director's Cut,"Before we get into this let me just say that I love Broken Sword. The original Broken Sword. I have probably completed it more times than I have other games in my library. I especially go back to it now and again to experience its world, its characters and its humour.  So you can imagine my excitement when finding this 'Directors Cut' edition on Steam.  Unfortunately I simply could never recommend this version to anyone who wishes to experience Broken Sword and see what all the fuss was about back in the day.  If you really want to play Broken Sword nowadays, there is a 'Broken Sword Trilogy' DVD-based package that you can buy on Amazon or EBay (ie. a non-Steam release) and it includes a perfect working version of the actual original Broken Sword and it will work with modern hardware and OS. So go for that.  As for the problems with this version? There are so many to talk about...  - Missing dialogue which affects the humour and even misses vital plot points. - MIssing animations (NPC characters no longer have a talking animation, the flags no longer flutter in the breeze at the Hotel Ubu). - Missing interactions with certain objects throughout the game (such as just about everything in the museum, you can't read the patients medical records in the hospital, you can't read the historical information on the boards at Montfaucon). - Missing cut scenes such as when you first enter the castle in Ireland. - Missing interactions with entire characters in some locations (such as the guy in the middle bed in the hospital). - Sound glitches whereby I heard Lady Piermonts piano playing in other random locations (amongst other problems). - A clear difference in recording quality between the new dialogue and the old dialogue (especially noticeable with a headset). - The additional scenario as Nico offers nothing to the game as a whole and then just abruptly ends and is gone. - Some puzzles have been simplified to a ridiculously simple level (such as the goat puzzle). - The game is now 100% linear - you can't go to Montfaucon before completing the hospital section, for example. - The diary is a pointless addition and the text within it is far too basic - almost childishly written. It also somehow knows vital plot-related information before these elements have been revealed through dialogue.  All in all if you want to rediscover Broken Sword for even play it for the very first time - I simply could never recommend this version of the game. Find a working copy of the original and play that. It's a far superior experience and you won't be missing out on so much material either."
57650,Dungeons,Gets very boring very quickly.
57680,The First Templar,"GREAT Game!  I loved the action and especially the story. Wish there was a second story or part II, but what more could be done? Perhaps a story that takes place in the future when the grail is again lost and required again to save mankind.   Anyhow, I was going to get this game years ago on the Xbox360 but read some negative reviews and skipped it. BIG MISTAKE! Luckily I picked it up on Steam years later much cheaper and must admit I am very happy I did.   I can't say it enough GREAT Story! Kept me hooked for hours upon hours. Just when I said 'Ok, one more act, then I'll quit!' except that was 2 or 3 acts earlier and I kept going. Time flies when you are having fun so they say. I can verify that is TRUE! :)   Kept playing until I finished the story. Reminded me of a great movie when movies were great. Was also kind of cool because it kind of related to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, though centuries earlier. Alot of the trials and traps reminded me of the latter part of that movie. Great job to the developers in creating a game and telling an excellent story!"
57690,Tropico 4,Another one of those games that makes you say '5 more minutes' even though you said the same thing 9 hours ago.
57700,Who's That Flying?!,"I literally hate this game. I made it to the final boss and just had enough before beating it. Why can I play bullet hell shmups like Touhou for hours and yet can't stand this game for more than an hour and a half? It boils down to the health system the game uses. This game treats enemies passing the left side of the screen as a decrease in hit points, which is fine; it's not the first time that idea has been used in a shmup. The problem is the enemy design. Because the player character has no health, the large enemies instead stun the player and reverse the controls, while the small grunts move towards the left side of the screen. This leads to pure frustration when you screw up and just have to watch a small horde of enemies pass you by while you wait the obligatory 3 seconds or so to get back in the action. And it's infuriating. The combo system, required to get attacks capable of destroying some of the enemy waves, makes this more punishing. One mistake and you lose that super-beam you needed to even pass the level. This leads to a rich-get-richer style scenario which, while fine, just pisses me off.   It's an alright shmup. Get it if you don't mind being stunned for about 3 seconds when hit and really enjoy trying to get perfect runs in shmups. If loss of control annoys you like it does me, however, stay far away.  Oh and force vsync when running or the game will play at a ridiculous speed that is literally impossible. I managed to beat exactly one level like that before looking up a fix."
57740,Jagged Alliance - Back in Action,"Fired this game up after a pause(~6month) and LOL-d hard at the very beginning, on the first hire: 'Fidel is not himself lately. And it´s not a bad thing'.  Haven´t finished the prequels- tried them as a kid a bit- and maybe this game isn´t like the prequels, but it doesn´t mean it´s bad to the bones. The characters are funny and the whole game has the 'parody thing' going on.   The best thing about JABIA is the camera handling imo. With ALT key it´s possible to peak behind every corner and with aided aiming lines it´s possible to precisely plan my actions.  And for the good camera work I´ve ditched 'other' turn based games to come enjoy this one.   In general if you know the rules the game sets for you, then it´s more certain in outcome than other tactical turn based games. And that´s what I like about this game; if I choose the right team with right equipment for the job then the outcome is mine to decide. Main factors to take into account are equipment+skills which decide my mercs aiming time and enemies are wallhacking aimbots. But both sides hit if the teamwork is planned correctly. If the rules are accepted from the very beginning then the game can be entertaining- can´t be anything better than setting team to nade the room and then rush in to clean the room with pump action shotguns and all that executing out in a few secs.  Now to the AI part. Yep the AI and game mechanics is unfinished. It´s actually possible to go on stealth kills against lvl 1(maybe 2 also) enemies but but later in game against higher level AI the only way is rambo style. (DLC Point Blank was fun bc I could go with 45 cal silenced pistol and take out the whole garrison alone). In the early stage it´s important to choose correct merc for certain tasks, if it says expert in stealth, then stealth approach is doable etc... The most fun part is the start of the game, where I can play out different approaches till it goes rambo style with 2 squads of rambos.  And for as old a game as this, it still looks good though unoptimised.  Later in game there is indeed lot´s of micromanagement- all actions must be double checked on mercs, mules have to carry equipment over the map etc. But grinding money for equipment can be fun too.  One good side of the game is that when I return to my favourite multiplayer FPS I always think more tactically and am doing much better. Haven´t experienced this with any other tactical turn based games, so it must do something right in the end..."
57800,Doc Clock: The Toasted Sandwich of Time,"This game was sitting in my library for years. Eventually, I gave in to boredom and, with hesitation, decided to play through it.  The gameplay is all about combining parts, which are mostly found at the beginning of each level, to create machines that will get you around obstacles such as chasms, hills and deadly spikes. It's easier than it might sound, the machines I came up with were all small variations of the same vehicle. If they failed to cross an obstacle on the first try, I rewound time and tried again until they succeeded. The design of the vechicle had little significance and no outside-the-box thinking was required to complete any level. I feel no sense of accomplishment."
57900,Duke Nukem Forever,"At certain moments, Duke Nukem Forever feels as it should. Unfortunately, between glimpses of brilliance lie wide swaths of mediocrity. And therein lies the biggest problem with DNF; it is not bad enough to be amusing, nor good enough to be worth taking a look. It is just ten hours of a boring waste of time."

58230,MacGuffin's Curse,"I wanted to like this game because I thought there was a hint of John Constantine hidden in there. Then I found out that Sokoban puzzlers are still about as much fun as moving house and re-arranging furniture in cramped rooms. It might still appeal to someone if they find lugging and rotating sofas around hallways fun. The art style and writing do have some good bits but as a whole I can't say I enjoyed my time playing it through. Still, the developers clearly enjoyed their work and I'm probably just not the right target group."
58400,Turba,"I'm not surew here I got htis game, but I saw it in my library and figured I'd try it. Honestly it is not very good :(   The music that comes with it is a bit annoying. The gameplay is bad, and I'm not a fan of what I think they were going for, which is a bland thing to try to be. Best of luck to the devs though, I'm sure the next one they do will be a bit better. :)  Positives are that the gameplay appears to be simple, at the very least, the gameplay shown by the tutorial."

Dont buy this."
58560,Runaway: A Twist of Fate,"Finally!! The third game in the trilogy managed to rock it! After an awful beginning and an okay continuation, Pendulo finally made it! This game is a really good experience, but to get the story you would still have to torture yourself with the previous ones :/ I have no actual negatives for the story, characters, music, items and environmental manipulation in this game.  Only problem is worth a failing .exe file which crashed my game at exit on four occasions. Sadly, this demonstrates am ongoing lack of will top fix this kind of issues within the Pendulo project."

Uninstalled after the 234523453463455003456th attempt at passing the stupid unbeatable bugged idiotic flower 'puzzle' (which wasn't the first so-called 'puzzle' to require a walkthrough because it didn't make any sense whatsoever; using a chicken with a pulley in the middle to improvise a makeshift zip-line - for an example of a classic archetipical 'absurd' graphic adventure puzzle - makes sense - somewhat - and is funny; having to figure out what random order you have to click some buttons in without any clues, and then having to do it with extremely precise yet unpredictable timing, and having to figure out the order again from scratch once you fail, time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again because the stupid 'puzzle' is ♥♥♥♥ing bugged and fails regardless of your timing is neither reasonable nor funny). ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥, don't waste your time.

Even after uninstalling it and writing this warning to anyone who might be fooled by the incompetent excuses for scammers at Pendulo I still need to ♥♥♥♥ing PUNCH something to try to relax after the mental state this utter turd of a 'game' has left me in. ♥♥♥♥.

58610,Wargame: European Escalation,"It doesn't make it clear what to do, everything is a jumbled mess; It expects you to know what the functions are right off the bat"
60,Ricochet,My score is higher than the amount of players on the average server.   6/10.
6000,STAR WARS™ Republic Commando,"This game is old, but gold. Even 12 years later, this game still has amazing graphics and a unique gameplay to most FPS games. I really love it. I'm currently reliving a part of my childhood. :D Can't say I regret this. I highly recommend the game, it has great graphics, great gameplay and an amazing storyline. A 10/10 from me for this game. :)"
6010,Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis,"This is most probably one of the best games I've ever played and even though I finished it a couple of times (and I'm replaying it right now), it never ceases to surprise me! It has different endings, and a different gameplay depending on how you play. I absolutely recommend this for whoever loves puzzles and have a great sense of humor :)"
6020,STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy™,Step 1: Get Game Step 2: Max out force lightning Step 3: ???? Step 4: Profit 
6030,STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast™,"I played this game before having it on Steam. What can I say? It's one of the best action game out there, and one of the best Star Wars games. It has nearly everything: good story, excellent gameplay, wonderful companions and interesting enemies, good graphics (for its age), multiplayer, force powers and... lightsabers (and that's really all that matters) !  Be warned though: the game is tough. At least on higher difficulty levels. But hey, if you're stuck... cheats are easy to find."
60340,LUXOR: 5th Passage ,"Bad interface, boring and repetitive"
60350,Glowfish,"Edit: Most of the people reviewing this agme have barely touched it. If you're actually trying to achieve the goals in the game, 100% completion not just floating from level to level [how your six year old is playing it] it's stupid hard. It's stupid boring, too.  Original review: Uninspired and foolishly difficult. There are far better games you can get for even $3."
6040,The Dig,"I used to have a retail copy of this game, and like an idiot I loaned it out and it just disappeared off the face of the Earth. Still one of my favourite old school point and click games. I love settings like this, I like the music, the puzzles are a little challenging but not bad enough to warrant googling the solution every single time. I'd totally recommend this game to anyone, its amazing"
6060,"Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (Classic, 2005)",This was my favorite PS2 game. Love it.
60600,ProtoGalaxy,"Game is ♥♥♥♥♥, controls are wonky, with some fixes to that it could be a really good game, but the interface feels too clunky. Maybe multiplayer is better, but I tried to get into this game to no avail. Keep searching."
60700,Power Of Defense,"A quite nice tower-defense-like game (if you imagine your towers are living creatures and are constantly moving to get away from this cruel world :) ). I, however, failed to fully understand the game mechanics, so it generally takes me more than half an hour to pass a level or to get completely stuck on it. So, I may consider this game a bit unbalanced. Unpredictable level time / length is a huge minus for me."
6080,Thrillville: Off the Rails,"No idea what I'm playing lol. Just a kids game with rollercoasters and amusement vendors. No onder why you took it off the console so quickly. Sorry but nobody here, including me likes such a game. Maybe kids do but i don't the game itself is a ripoff of most amusement park games and has no interest for me."
60800,Numen: Contest of Heroes,This game did not play well with my Nvidia drivers I had to re-boot after exiting the game as my screen was all messed up. So for that alone I can't recommed it.
6090,Armed and Dangerous,"I remember seeing my uncle play this game back in the day, and it still stands as one of the funniest I've ever played. 5/5"
61100,Lucid,  Lucid is that kind of game that you play after hard day. You can concentrate yourself and rest from stress
6120,Shank,"Update on 19/07/2016 The game fails to launch on windows 10. The SteamOS/linux version is unplayable as well. The gamepad is behaving in a insane way I there is no way to remap the buttons.   Shank was a great surprise.  At first it seems like a stupid smashing button side scroller which could be a flash game... And with a bit of time and as more skills you get. You realize you can actually kick ♥♥♥ in that game. And really play it badass. When the usual game becomes too easy they added an hardcore mode which is really challenging  As you advance in the game you are actually surprised by how stylish are the graphics. It feels like an animated comic book.  The story is there only to keep you playing and could be summup in 3 words. But the cutscene are very stylish, not long , just enough to give you a break to relax your fingers.  The whole 'machete' atmosphere is totally there, the absurdity balances out the violence. The music maintains that mexican feeling. It's never ridiculous but it's very absurd and I like that. The design and animations are very nicely done and you ve got plenty of combos and ways to manage your different weapons.  I did not feel any lag on the input. As some people were complaining it was my only fear while buying the game.  Devs managed the difficulty in a subtle way so you can play it noob or hardcore. As a die and retry, anyone can finish that game and i suppose have a nice experience. As it s long but no so much, not enough to become boring. If you wanna play it badass and not get killed once you can too. If you're kinda old and like that oldschool beat'em all arcade difficulty challenge, you ll get it. Thx to the hardcore mode :)"
61310,Fractal: Make Blooms Not War,"Satisfying and simple effects. Nice visual design, and the sound effects/music mesh with everything well.  The core gameplay mechanic of filling the board relies too much on randomness for me, though. I can be calculating and strategic with the deterministic pushing and powerups, but the random placement of tiles after a bloom pops feels like a lottery I can't control."
61500,Age of Wonders,"This was definitely a really solid game when it came out. While going through campaigns it does feel a little too time consuming playing out each fight, while having the fights automatically simulate themselves feels like a cheap way to play through the game. I enjoy the game at times but other times it just moves way too slow for me and I get bored. I love games like this where you have tactical battles and able to level up special characters and equip them with different skills or weapons, even the regular units can be leveled up, but it just doesn't feel as rewarding as it should. This game was ahead of its time though so I really can't give it a bad review. Alot of different unit types and races, and the storyline in the game is pretty good as well. If you can get it dirt cheap try it out."
61510,Age of Wonders 2: The Wizard's Throne,"Didn't like it as much as the first one. The whole Merlin theme is shallow. Extremely annoying not being able to keep your character stats as you progress. I guess Merlin isn't as smart as they say he is if he couldn't even keep the easiest skills and had to relearn everything 6 times and still forget on the last level. Pretty interesting ending though. Combat similar to the first age of wonders, turn base strategy with elements of luck."
61520,Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic,"Not as nice graphics as Age of Wonders 3.  But this is slightly more charming. Possibly the most charming game ever written. 'What do you mean?' Well I mean the audio voice acting is silly and fun, and the artwork is fairy tale and whimsical, and the animations are just a little primitive.  The UI is a little dated. For example switching between cities is tedious (there's no 'next' button), but for the most part the UI isn't overtly bad (I've played much worse).  The gameplay is similar to the original Master of Magic especially the tactical battles.  Bang for the buck is sky high."
61600,Zen Bound® 2,It manages to be relaxing without being boring.
61700,Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes,"I've given this game enough chances to prove itself.  There is no option to customize opponents in quick battle mode.  The UI is confusing and too little data is given about conditions of the units and the walls.  The game lacks a 'one move undo' button which would eliminate harmfulness of accidental button presses (issue mostly with laptops).  The game lacks a quick way to restart the battle, making campaigns tedious due to long process of loading a save and initializing the battle again.  The game keeps f***ing freezing when you win a battle (see screenshots). However, the condition seems to be that the Sylvan dragon attacks on the last turn.  The whole game is basically based on RNG, making victories hollow and losses frustrating without chance to learn."
61730,Critter Crunch,"Brilliant graphics, animation, gameplay, varied challenges and the more fun I had in a puzzle game for years."
620,Portal 2,This game should be called : Loading Screens 2. Seriously what's wrong with all the loading time WTF. Even if I have SSD it's still so annoying
6200,Ghost Master,"I got this game on CD back in 2005, loved every minute of it. Also love coming back to it occasionally - even after all those years it's still perfectly playable. Sure, there's few bugs/glitches, but this is limited to the randomness of mortals movement. While this game is a lot of fun to play, some levels can pose a challenge, especially in the later levels, where you have to fight Ghostbusters and time itself. Some puzzles can also be hard, but the enslaved ghosts give enough tips to solve them.  14 levels sure isn't much, but considering some can take even an hour it's still a great choice to fill up an entire day.  Soundtrack is awesome, really fits the game. Graphics could be a little bit better, especially for 2003, but all in all it's still passable in 2016.  If you haven't played this game yet and you enjoy rogue-like style games - you can't miss this one."
62000,Flight Control HD,This game is better on a tablet.
6210,Vegas: Make It Big,Waste of money. The mechanic was weak and it never felt like it was building towards anything.
62100,Chime,"Chime is a fun little puzzle game where the blocks you place add to the music being played. It's surprisingly engaging! Unfortunately, certain mechanics that are not really explained (like when blocks dissapear, what breaks your combo, and how you get more time for your timer) make the game a little less engrossing. There are also far too few tracks to be very replayable, and the gameplay connection to the music, while present, is pretty dispensable. Some more rhythmic mechanics would go a long way, as well as a few more tracks. (There is a sequel I have not played, so it might be a better investment.)  For a few dollars, Chime is a fun distraction for those craving a mesmerising puzzle experience. Check it out!"
6220,FlatOut,"I've been playing FlatOut since 2004 and I can only confirm that, despite its few annoying quirks, it's definitely the most remarkable driving experience you can have. FlatOut2 has better graphics, but it's less challenging. More arcadey fun, sure. But if you really want to enjoy the adrenaline of high-speed drifting on dirt tracks this is the game!  After all, I only stopped playing Carmageddon because of Flat Out... that must count for something :)  I'm still waiting for the perfect driving game though... Carmageddon meets FlatOut + extensive multiplayer options would be the dream come true!"
6250,Making History: The Calm & The Storm,"I must first state in my review that the game is fun with a good strategic game of the entire World War 2. Sadely, that was before it stopped working. After about 5 hours of gameplay I got off the game to go about my daily life. When I came back later and attempted to launch the game the game told me that my liscense key was not working and to re-download the game. After re-dowloading the game it still did not work. I must finally say: Do not buy this game."
6270,Ducati World Championship,"Astonishingly poor quality semi-polished pseudo re-release of an even older title from the Dreamcast era. This may be the only racing game I have ever played where the game is so easy that it is literally impossible to crash, which is ironic since the game itself crashes so often that I can't even complete a single race. The only positive I can come up with is Lacuna Coil."
630,Alien Swarm,"Ok, so if you block that door, we stand here and I put a turret right there, we'll be Ok for sure when they come from that path...........Oh ♥♥♥♥ !! ♥♥♥♥ !!! Shoot'em mother ♥♥♥♥ers !!!"
6300,Dreamfall: The Longest Journey,"8/10 - Great Game  Gameplay takes a major backseat, infact the puzzles/combat are downright below mediocre at times, which both are luckily kept to a minimum through the experience. Instead what we get is a wonderfully crafted interactive experience with an incredible story, characters, lore, writing, set pieces. This game is grand in it's scale for story telling, and it has you traveling all over the world and then some. The revelations that occur midway through the story, and towards the end are pretty incredible. This game also has a real sense a humor that doesn't get old or feel forced and I caught myself laughing out loud on a few occations. Mind you this game leaves off on a huge cliff hanger, but still manages to be satisfying in it's own right.   Can't wait to play the sequel Dreamfall: Chapters."
6310,The Longest Journey,"I had no idea how really bad the graphics were. I had no idea how boring the conversations were. I can't believe the high ratings and reviews unless they were written 20 years ago. 30 minutes in game and removed it from computer. I'm not sure I can trust these reviews. Seriously, a score of 91/100? Really??? Total waste of money and time."
63110,Alter Ego,THE WORST GAME EVER!!! I was enjoying it until THE END which SUCKS well beyond anything you can imagine and makes playing the whole game a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME... I have gamed for DECADES and this is the only video game I have ever played IN MY LIFE that I regreted starting.... Could have ended it SEVERAL different ways!!! And they choose the absolute WORST.... They should even be allowed to make games any more... Yes it's that bad...
63200,Monday Night Combat,A mess of fun and going to be a great competitive game on the league circuits
63380,Sniper Elite V2,It's cool
63500,Swords and Soldiers HD,Just remembered I had this.  Awful.
63610,Riven,"On my Windows 10 Lenovo, the Steam Riven kicks me back to the top of the tower, whenever I reach the end of the hidden tunnel and try to return. Tried three different game starts. Even with the game reinstalled. Me, machine, or game? Not satisfied."
63620,Cosmic Osmo,Way more fun than you'd think. Holy Mackerel!
63630,Manhole,What the ♥♥♥♥ even is this?
63640,Spelunx,Fast pace COD clone. Will play again!
63650,Uru: Complete Chronicles,A really good third-person adventure. 5 stars.
63660,Myst: Masterpiece Edition,I love this game. I feel like I'm ten years old again.
6370,Bloodline Champions,"It's a good game, by all means. It's just very difficult to get in a match, because of the dead servers. It's also displeasant to see the huge money cap for unlocking new champions or playable classes being 9000 to the lowest being 6000, and only gaining 100 currency each succesful game. However if you don't mind trying it out on singleplayer and or get lucky to find a game. You should definetly try it. I'd give this game a   -6/10 ~Good system and fun controls, however poorly executed with detrementing skill caps, farming and dead servers. It could've been a greater game."
63700,BIT.TRIP BEAT,"Gaijin games don't really look like games to me anymore.  In all honesty they look like music visualizers that give the one nerd in the party something to do, while the rest of the normal people occasionally glance at the effects and say 'Oh, that's cool I guess.'"
63710,BIT.TRIP RUNNER,"If you like music games, bright colorful graphics, and an arcade feel this game might be for you. Awesome chiptune soundtrack if you are a fan of 8 bit music."
63800,Delve Deeper,"First off: I never had any technical troubles with this game.  This is a 2 to 4 player board game on your PC. Don't play this alone. With the right people it is a lot of fun and you will scratch your eyes out over who will get what treasure.  The graphic is nice but nothing special. It really is all about watching your friends dig up a wrong tunnel while you are happy over your nice treasure, only to have it be worth negative gold in the end."
63900,Fantasy Wars,"I remember buying this game for my birthday when it was released, I thought what I was getting myself into would've been Great, instead; it turned out to be a pile of ♥♥♥♥, it wasn't entertaining and it didn't do anything that any turn-based game hasn't covered, this is not worth the 14.99, my advice? Walk away from this game now and act like you never knew it existed."
63910,King's Bounty: Crossworlds,I love the king's bounty games. This one is probably the most refined of them all.
63940,Men of War: Vietnam,"Fun game, but felt like there could have been more than just a small team in the American missions. Have the US Army defend a fire base or take a hill would have been an awesome aspect."
63950,IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover,"Fantastic game and you can't beat it for the price. The Team Fusion mod is about to become a permanent part of the game as the license for this game is no longer in the hands of Ubisoft (yay!) but with the team that does IL2 BoS. Buy it now for a paltry $10 or if you want to wait and avoid the mod patching throw this on your wishlist, get it during the next steam sale for $5.  North Africa campaign is also coming fyi!"
63960,Theatre of War 3: Korea,"This game either works on your computer or it doesn't. I'm pretty sure most negative reviews are because of the latter. If it does, it's great fun, even if I'm personally really bad at attacking without getting blown up first. If it doesn't work, just refund it, but assuming it does, the ui is not great, but I've definitely seen much worse. The sounds and graphics are pretty good(for this type of game at least. Don't expect AAA visuals.) The AI is decent, it has some occaisional hiccups and pathfinding issues, but it's generally alright. The controls are also like the ui, not great, but not what I'd call bad either. The thing I like most probably about this game is the AI though, at least the fact that the air support can choose targets of opportunity and not just kill the same tank with everything even after it's destroyed.  Note: Tutorial is pretty bare bones, although it's worth seeing. The best way to learn the ropes IMO is to just play some battles until you get pretty good."
6400,Joint Task Force,"It's bargain basement, but not a big pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Ok, it's not amazingly brilliant neither, just a middle-grade competent and playable RTS - but for *this* price this is a no-brainer must-buy if you really like RTS games. It's settings are various US vs Middle East in the 1990's - 2000's type conflicts. Not much to say really, as you will have seen this all before if you are an afficionado of the RTS genre. A few people, especially those who are using Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 report problems getting it to run due to 'missing PhysX drivers' but here's links for the drivers you'll need to get it (hopefully) up and running:-   http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.0604-legacy-driver.html  - for Win Vista / 7 / 8 and 8.1 (not sure how Win 10 will work with this) &lt;----- TY to 'Gekido' for posting this link up   http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html  - for Win XP / Vista and 7 thanks to 'Winkeltim' for posting this"
64000,Men of War: Assault Squad,"This game has little to do with strategy, the battlefields are the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over and the battles turns to mosh pits, Stalingrad level ones to be accurate, you will throw hundrents of men to their deaths just to halt the enemy.  I would like to play more RTS from WW2 (Which is realistic) sadly, there is little strategy in this game with horrific campaign and there is no bot AI, so you cannot even practice wtf ?"
6420,Nexus: The Jupiter Incident,fantastic game! a must buy
65070,Ride 'em Low,i expected this game to be fun i was so dissapointed i love lowrider and lowrider games but this game is mostly about racing but i'd give this game a decent 6/10
65080,Kaptain Brawe," Pros:   + Good art (Reminds me Monkey Island). + Decent gameplay overall.   Cons:   - I get C++ R6025 error all the time, game was crashing so it was painful to play the game. - No voiceovers. - Very short. - Animations are very bad. - Story was uninteresting. - Achievements are only for in-game.   Verdict:  Only buy this game when its on discount. Not so good, not so bad."
6510,Lost Planet: Extreme Condition,"Sadly, I went into this really expecting to like it as I had played Lost Planet 3 before and thought that it was a pretty good game. However, after having gone through as much of it as I am willing to go through, which for the record is up to the last boss, where it decided to glitch out or something because the boss had no health left, the tower was stopped (I'm not even sure that was needed,) and yet, the boss would not fall down. See  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=830647462  for proof. Yes, I got his health down first. Then I went for the tower just in case that was a thing because he wasn't falling over. Then I hit him again a couple more times just in case it was the 'pixel of health' issue where he just had so little that it didn't show on the bar. But nope, in the end I had to say screw it, I win, I am youtubing the ending.  The controls in this game are very unintuitive, and really horribly set up for mouse and keyboard by default, and with how many buttons there are that do things, I don't know that it could be made much better even with redefining keys. The boss battles are fairly uninspired, and either too easy or too hard. Just when you think you're about to be handed something badass, and go have a ton of fun, you realize how clunky the controls for everything are and almost wish you were on foot again. The story in this game is pretty good, nothing spectacular, but pretty good.   All in all, I must rate this a 2/10 because of the clunky controls, and the way it cheated me out of my ending. With better controls, and a ending that doesn't cheat you, it could probably be a 6/10, but sadly Capcom dropped the ball on this one and I've gotta say no. If you've played the others and are curious about this one, just find yourself a playthrough on youtube."
65200,Dive to the Titanic,"Hmm, this is a kinda wierd game. The controls are very bad. An annoying voice over constantly speaks and its ♥♥♥♥ing braindead. The goals are wierd and very badly explained. They got some quite nice info about titanic but thats kinda all"
65270,Demolition Company Gold,"This game is pretty dated. I ended up requesting a refund because I couldn't get it to work with a controller, and there's no control guide like there is in Farm Simulator.  If Giants was to update the game with the same fidelity as Farm Sim 17, I'd buy it."
65300,Dustforce,I'm content with the fact that I will never beat this game.
65400,Archon:Classic,"Based off the obscure NES title, Archon, you and an opponent face each other in a mixture of chess and arcade-style combat. Move pieces around a board to capture important squares, but when two pieces meet, you directly control them on the field of battle in real time! Very fun, but it's only got local multiplayer, and playing against the computer isn't particularly stimulating.  Without nostalgia guiding your purchase or an IRL friend, I can't recommend this title - but if you have either, give it a shot."
6550,Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition,twenty dollars!?!?  for a broken game?  i bought this ♥♥♥♥♥ for 5 and still feel robbed.  to be fair i probably didnt have any luck with the fixes everyone mentions cause im using a razer serval gamepad.  classic game. good luck to everyone who thinks they can fix it. god knows valve cant.
65500,Aura: Fate of the Ages,"What in the world was this game? The prequel to another game? I had no clue what the actual story behind the action was at any point while I played, doing tedius chores designed apparently to be done just because someone told me to do them and everything must be as complicated as possible (again, unfathomably). I think it was supposed to be like Myst--it reminded me of that game--only this one left off an actual story or plot...or frankly purpose."
65530,SpellForce 2 - Faith in Destiny,"Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny is a great game, especially with the addition of Free Mode which allows for many extra hours of gameplay. While the campaign is not perfect, this is because a different company took over the game. It is still quite fun and very much worth playing. I enjoyed it greatly! &lt;3"
65540,Gothic,"Today, I got a quest to clear an old mine shaft full of nightmarish giant bugs from hell that could oneshot me.  I cleared it and the guy who gave me the quest rewarded me with a 6-pack of beer. I smoked a huge joint of weed afterwards and gobbled the whole 6-pack. In-game. 10/10.  Also the steam version of the game WILL NOT LAUNCH with Windows 10 (and prior releases if the reviews are to be trusted) and that is why I cannot in good conscience recommend this version of the game. Here's how to launch it correctly :  First, start the game like you would do normally. Nothing will happen but Steam will say that the game is running. you'll have to go to the Task Manager (ctrl+alt+del, or to open it directly, ctrl+l.shift+escape), then go to details, then right click on GOTHIC.EXE, then click on 'analyze wait chain', then close whatever program's interfering.  Then you'll have to download the 1.08k patch, then the player kit for Gothic 1, then the system pack. Once you've done all this, install them all, IN THIS ORDER : if you don't, the system pack won't be able to install.  AND THEN you'll have to go to the root directory of Gothic 1, go in the System folder, right click on gothic.exe, select 'properties', select the 'compatibility' tab, and tick the 'run this program as an administrator' box.  If you're patient enough to do all this, then congrats, one of the best series of role-playing games of the early 00's awaits you, adventurer.  If not, you're forgiven. just get the GoG release, I hear there aren't any bugs.  FIX YOUR DAMN GAME, STEAM !  PS : Don't trust the numbers you're seeing here, I put waaaaay more than enough hours into this game to be able to have an opinion on it. The system pack comes with a launcher that bypasses steam I believe, that's why I seem to have played only an hour when I really have played dozens.  PPS : Also, beware of exploring TOO much. This can lead to bugs that can potentially break your game. For instance, in my first walkthrough, I explored the monastery north of the swamp waaaayyyy before the story tells me to go there. When I did, the game bugged and broke. I couldn't progress into the story anymore, no matter what I did, because I was supposed to open the gate leading to that place when AND ONLY WHEN a certain NPC was there. So yeah, be careful. Don't go to any remote place until the game specifically tells you to do so, or if you're willing to play through hours of content you've already done, back your main save file up by saving in a separate file AND THEN do it."
65560,Painkiller: Redemption,"Of all the underwhelming Painkiller games? Well Redemption has got to be the most underwhelming of them all. Locked in tiny area after tiny areas this soon became the king of the generic circle strafing simulators. I really felt I was trapped in hell playing this one, excuse the pun."
65600,Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition,"This game, totally, owns."
65610,ArcaniA: Fall of Setarrif,"This is a fairly disappointing expansion to a fairly disappointing game. The only good thing I have to say is that it lets the player use a save file from the original game, so all the ♥♥♥♥ I did and leveled up wasn't just a waste of time. Unfortunately, like Gothic 3's expansion, this takes place outside of the main story, which is depressing, especially considering how well Gothic 2 nailed it.  The very linear add-on takes place in a massive, unexplored chunk of the map from the main game. It just seems like a tease, to have it there in the first place, with this expansion being the only way to get to it. However, this significantly smaller area doesn't give me the stuttering problems I had in the original game, leading me to believe that the engine is just set up to render most of the playable world simultaneously.  As I mentioned earlier, the player can import a leveled character, but this snaps the already fragile difficulty in half, because by this point most of the skills are probably maxed out. I kept pausing the game to check whether I was really still playing on the hardest difficulty because this was such a cakewalk, and on top of all that, there is much better equipment to be had here as well, making it even easier. I don't think I died even once.  Finally, it's too short. I beat the thing in less than 3 and a half hours, and I did every single quest... not that the expansion has a lot of quests to begin with, but that just goes to show how utterly lacking in content this $15 is. Thank God I got it on sale, at least."
65730,Take On Helicopters,"I had bought the DVD version initially, and 'right out of the box', slow FPS rates were the first thing to attend.  Being a virtual pilot for many years on the MSFS series, it was quite natural to give TOH a shot.  Right from the beginning , FPS rates had to be 'treated' using the intuitive menu settings (video).  Knowing all too well the finicky nature of FSX, and it's frequent CTD's caused by sliders too much to the right, and to the many checked boxes, this was all too familiar for me.  The results of those major reductions in all of the settings, including clouds effects and desabling anisotropic filtering, were a big improvement. That was obviously predictable, at the cost of some eye candy, and very limited visibility.  I can not tolerate bad FPS, it destroys the immersion completely, and flying becomes so much less enjoyable.  I could not use my Thrustmaster T Flite Hotas X (PC), because the throttle was activated by a toggle switch situated in the back of the T handle. It has a spring loaded return position that prohibits full idle control.  Thankfully, my old Force 3D Pro was on stand by.  Must inform all of you that sensivity settings must be all the way to the left, except throttle of course.  Real life helicopter pilots, have confessed that flying heli's on home simulators with our joysticks, is actually harder than in a full size helicopter. The few inches of travel they permit, make them a real handful to control in TOH.  You must have the steady hand of a brain surgeon, in many flight parameters.  The default and add onHelicopters on MSFS, are much more easy to control, and less of 'widow makers' in an instant... All this to say that I wanted to buy the 'Hinds' add-on, but could so only if TOH was from Steam, instead of a boxed DVD. Taking advantage of the great bundle offer, I added it to my library.  To my big surprise TOH on Steam became much less touchy with the video settings, and as big bonus, FPS improved noticably.  Also, all my previous progress from TOH on DVD thankfully transfered to the Steam version, even though a message had advised to the contrary.  Go check on the net for hints when stuck on missions or tasks. So long fellow virtual pilots. A.  PS: A few hours after writing this review I was litterally stuck (as many others seeking a solution on the Bohemia's official forum site) on a mission called 'The hand that feeds me' consisting of picking up a container on a cargo ship. Trust me on that one, a 'bug' has been confirmed by the developpers. You will not be able to lift up this container from hell, without damaging it.  Some say it worked after a dowloaded patch was used, but Steam has already included them all.  The ONLY solution is a good old cheat, even suggested by Bohemia. It is the same for Arma 2. Press and hold the Shift key located on the left side of the keyboard, and then press the - (minus) on the numerical keyboard during gamplay. No menu will appear at all.  Type blindly: endmission. A menu will appear and just end it there.  Alleluia will be the appropriate exclamation. I have the chance to own many non-default helicopters on FS2002, FS2004, and FSX.  It includes the Dodosim Bell 206, from Flight One Software.  So in all modesty, I am a decent virtual helicopter pilot, and after numerous tries including all angles of approach, even resting a wheel on the container, the mission ends suddenly the moment the cables are barely moved.  Again, a confirmed 'huge bug' indeed. Don't be surprised that you might need that cheat again later.  Landing on a cargo ship, a 'collision bug' creeps in (again), big time.  When landing very smothly, the helicopter melts into the ship, just like the floor would cave in... At least you will finish the game and enjoy it, not feeling guilty of using an emergency tool, to rectify errors that are beyond your control."
65740,Carrier Command: Gaea Mission,DO NOT BUY.  This game is broken.  It should not even be for sale.
65780,Arma: Gold Edition,its good but iv got a glitch where i cant here sounds ? plz fix ? 
65790,Arma: Cold War Assault,"  I can see why many people still love this game but it has aged very badly and for some one who has never played it in its prime it's hard to enjoy.  -The controlls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -Movement is clunky at best -Graphics... While they don;t matter, the faces give me night terrors -Dialog is cringe worthy  "
65800,Dungeon Defenders,"Simultaneously the best game of all time and one of the most frustrating games of all time. Why, you can read elsewhere, I'll just give my heartfelt recommendation"
65930,The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,"I really like the XCOM games. I played the first ones released many many years ago and I really welcome that they have blown new life in the series. The Bureau takes on another approach than the other games, which is interesting. However, I feel like that the challenges in this game appeared at the wrong places. Research is not a thing in this game, you just get upgrades 'for free' as you progress through the game. It almost feels like it comes to easy compared to the other XCOM games. The challenge instead is to keep your team mates in order. The AI of the team mates is really terrible. Terrible to the extent that I have stopped playing the game. It becomes such a choir to keep them under control that you can not really be effective in a fight. Even if you put like 95% focus on trying to keep your team mates alive, at some point you may have to relocate yourself because enemys are closing in, or flanking you, and instantly that leaves your team mates unattended for long enough for them to run out of the cover your ordered them to stay in and run straight up to the most dangerous enemy and die - rendering them impossible to revive. Because if you run out there yourself you are dead as well. However, you need the team mates that you have invested time in levelling up and unlocking skills for. Sm it's a deadlock.  IMO opinion the stupidity of AI is a game breaker and I grown so tired of it that I don't know if I will ever finish this game. I stopped playing 8 hours in to the game and have been unable to motivate myself to continue for about 3 weeks now.  To this end, I can not recommend it. It's nice with variation from the other XCOM games, I like the atmosphere and the looks of the game. But the AI is, like I said, a game breaker."
65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"A steep step down in gameplay from Civilization V, and a gigantic step down in story and character from Alpha Centauri. Bland uninteresting factions with shallow dealings between them. The aliens are uninspired, generic looking worlds. Dull interface, everything is basically the same colour on the tech web and city development page. The warfare is a slight bit more complex than the rock paper scissors format. I could go on and on with the absolute boring and mediocre details of this game, but there’s no real point. Don’t bother with this game unless you are a diehard fan and the game is on sale for at most $10."
67000,The Polynomial,"I don't know what this thing is. It's certainly not a rhythm game. Music is involved, but it doesn't really do anything. It's not really a space shooter either. I mean, you're in a 3D space, and you can shoot chain chomps that are floating around, and then they'll shoot you wherever you are and you'll die for a second. But there isn't a goal, and you don't really do anything. Or get anything done. There's a score, but even the game itself tells you it doesn't mean anything. Is this even a game? I don't know. Is this a review? I don't know! Don't buy this."
67370,The Darkness II,"Out of the six hours I spent playing this, one was spent exploring the art direction of the mansion, which turned out to be my favorite part of the game. The storyline hit an interesting turn about halfway through, earning its categorization of 'psychological horror,' and I became significantly more engaged in learning the truth and fate of the protagonist--but it became a tired, force-fed pleading of 'We're mind♥♥♥♥ing you, right? Right?' by the third repeat of the sequence; having a 'red pill or blue pill' choice demanding your input on whether you're believing it or not shatters the illustrative quality. The introduction of a skill tree to a shooter is always welcome, but there wasn't a single skill on the tree I actually wanted to use. The game boasts 'a new dimension' in slashing with demon arms as well as firing guns, but trying to do both was unwieldy. After being shot to death trying to get close enough to use slash I never did again. And why bother when you have guns?"
6800,Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines,"I was just a little boy when I played this game , it was so fun ."
6810,Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty,"The game is good, but it doesn't work on my PC. I remember how good it was, but if you have a new machine like me, don't buy it."
6840,Commandos 3: Destination Berlin,"Not as good as Commandos 2, but still a good game. It tripped over itself in a lot of ways, but the heart of Commandos lives on in it, and it did improve on a few things that make Commandos 1 and 2 wonky.  Shadow Tactics is a modern version of this kind of game, and I highly recommend that instead if you haven't played it yet."
6850,Hitman 2: Silent Assassin,"Old,but one of best! :D"
6860,Hitman: Blood Money,"Fix this ♥♥♥♥. Ive got a skylake and a 980TI and this decade old game runs ♥♥♥♥ poor. This is one of my all time favorites, but i cannot even finish a single level without crashing or freezing. Legit the best hitman game, but Dont waste your money on this copy as it may not work at all for you.  There is no support and its too late for a refund. Thanks steam!"
6880,Just Cause,"Great game, it is fun to play. Not as many bugs in the PC version as there is in the X-Box 360 version."
6900,Hitman: Codename 47,"Full review:  http://dagondogs.com/2016/11/02/killing-time-hitman-codename-47/   TL;DR: You could see some potential hidden under the surface of this 90's tech demo with a pricetag. Some potential. There are moments where the game asks you to do more than simply shoot the guy, which is something few other games were doing that at the time. However, I would argue that Hitman: Codename 47 is little more than a third-person shooter with stiff controls, the occasional opportunity to change your clothes, and strict mission objectives that prevent you from just being able to play the game your way. Unless you played this game to completion back when it came out and you hold nostalgia for it, or you just have the limitless patience necessary to try it today, stay away."
6910,Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition,"There is a reason why people commonly use phrases like 'every time you mention it, someone reinstalls the game' and 'best game of all time' when it comes to this game - the hype is justified for a reason.  Released in 2000, Deus Ex has stood the test of time thanks to its innovative gameplay concepts, engrossing storyline and well-written characters, both major and minor. The game puts you into the shoes of JC Denton, a government operative who is thrust into a world of violence, politics and intrigue while struggling to figure out who to trust.  The game combines elements of an FPS with an RPG-style management and upgrade system, well-written and developed characters and a variety of interesting locales to create an experience that is still unmatched. Whether you're searching through the streets of New York to take down a generator, investigating a conspiracy in a high-rise office building in Hong Kong or trying to stop a missile launch in the middle of the desert, the game throws a variety of situations at the player in the context of a major global conspiracy.  One thing I've always enjoyed about the story, and which keeps me coming back time and time again to replay it, is the range of possible solutions (and responses) to various problems faced in the game world. You can do things that seem counterintuitive or even absurd, and the game will recognize and praise/admonish you for your actions. Want to kill that nosy reporter, despite the fact that no one has asked you to? The game recognizes it. Want to skip the first mission by throwing a gas grenade at the front door of UNATCO HQ? The NPC's remark on it. Wait too long to talk to an NPC? They may have different introductory dialogue based on when you visit them.  Likewise, the characters are very well-written, and have actions that extend beyond conversations with the player and into e-mails, newspapers and books found around the game world. All this material is optional, and players can skip it as they so choose.  The combat and NPC reaction to damage can come off as a bit 'stiff' to modern audiences, but the movement and reaction system in general still holds up quite well, with enemies and NPC's reacting to damage and running away if they are hurt, stopping to reload and changing their firing position or chasing after the player during combat.  If there's anything I can criticize this game for (and that's very hard to do), the GOTY does introduce a couple of musical/ambient sound bugs that can lead to multiple pieces of music playing in the same level. Besides that, though, this is still the same tried-and-true Deus Ex experience - you'll play it for the deep characters and storyline, and stay for the different gameplay approaches and solutions (not to mention all of the mods and total conversions!).  Deus Ex is a classic, and it's a game I'm honored to have both in my physical and Steam library."
6920,Deus Ex: Invisible War,"I haven't tested this on Win10, so these are few thoughts from playing it on my Win7 PC a couple of years ago.  Firstly, there seems to be some weird issue during load screens where the game re-initialises itself and Steam gets confused about whether the game is still running, so this explains why my hours are so low despite making a bit of progress in the game.  The Jetsons-esque visual style was really off-putting for me. One of the great things about the original Deus Ex was that the world and tech felt grounded and relatable. This just feels too far out there. It's a pretty big leap from cyberpunk (high-tech, low life) to full-blown plasma sci-fi.  The city hub sections are extremely claustrophobic, with many corridors and alleys bridging the various points of interest. It's believed this was done deliberately to help optimise the game for the original Xbox, but it comes at the price of feeling very restricted in the open play area.  The combat was okay from memory; the biggest issue with it is the universal ammo system. Every gun in your inventory uses the same pool of ammo. Bleh.  I really wanted to get invested in the story after the brilliant Deus Ex, but it was quite hard to bear through these gameplay and tech issues.  What a shame."
6980,Thief: Deadly Shadows,Excellent game and worthy purchase 
70,Half-Life,"Awesome, classic and timeless this game may seem to drag on a bit on the difficult difficulty but is tons of fun."
7000,Tomb Raider: Legend,The only game i've played where the bugs have so much charm; like backup saved games instantly at my disposal.
70000,Dino D-Day,Extremely inaccurate depictions of all dinosaurs. Clearly Nazi propaganda
7010,Project: Snowblind,"Got this game because nostalgia, ended up just ruining another good memory. Never play a game that is nostalgic to you."
70100,Hacker Evolution,Typing game no hacking game that is hacker evolution
70110,Hacker Evolution - Untold,"Do you like waiting for a loading bar?  Do you like starting over one hour of waiting gameplay because you misclicked a dot?  Do you like entering in long, tedious, and unrealistic arcane commands?  Than This game is the game for you!"
70120,Hacker Evolution Duality,"Verdict: Hard pass.  This is another hacking game like uplink, except that it takes every bad thing about uplink and makes it far far worse. You have to hack into servers, except all hacking is determined by a stat based system, so it's more of a tactics game? It's a really bad tactics game. The real currency is your time, as you're being 'traced' as you do things, and every operation makes you wait to click something at the right time, or makes you watch a glorified progress bar. I spent most of my time staring at the screen, frustrated and bored.  At least with uplink I saw the beginnings of a story in the background. The uplink servers were all servers I could hack if I so dared. There was none of the hints of intrigue here. Why would anyone play a hacking game without intrigue?  It did have a console, and it gets +1 point for that, leaving it at -999."
7020,Rogue Trooper,Pretty decent game considering it goes very cheap during sales.  Has some nice mechanices and somewhat interesting world. I like the gunplay but clumsy controls made it a bit difficult to enjoy.
70200,Governor of Poker 2,"Best. Poker game. Ever.  The animations are nice, the game play is great. It is a lot less 'cheaty' than all other poker games (like when you have a one in a million hand like 4 of a kind, and an opponent just happens to have a royal flush - neither hands are seen hardly ever in a game, but there they are together....hmmmmmm).  I also enjoy the achievement trophies, it has kept me playing long after beating the game......there are trophies for certain types of hands, ways you beat others or got beaten, betting styles, etc.  HIGHLY recommended."
70210,Governor of Poker 2: Premium Edition,It's a funny game but don't make the mistake to pay 20 euro for this - IT DOESN'T WORTH THAT KIND OF MONEY.  Especially because I can't get rid of the feeling the game is 'programmed'to give you the cards you need each time you fold....
70300,VVVVVV,....people like this ♥♥♥♥? REALLY?
70400,Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale,"You buy and sell things. There are dungions which are fun, but I haven't really found anything valuable in them. It's anime style and has lots of cuteness, so hopefully you like that kind of stuff. Low quality graphics in the dungiouns, but its kind of a plus since my computer isn't that great. "
70420,Chantelise,"I could write a book about all the poor design choices in Chantelise.  In short, the game is tedious and clunky with a reward in the form of an extremely rushed, though somewhat interesting, storyline.  Combat operates in 3D with mostly 2D sprite enemies (bosses are the exception as they are 3D models). This perspective the game has makes it extremely hard to determine distance and you do not want to get hit in Chantelise anymore than you have to since your health and resources to refill said health are pretty low.  Progression is purely item based so no leveling here, but enjoy manually walking over those coins for the first half of the game or so until you unlock the item equip that makes money auto-pickup (but also weakens your character by way of sac'ing stats from other possible equips so you don't really want this equipped since the game is hard). And since you need to be buying stuff to make your character stronger, money is essentially exp and therefore you can't skip out on it.  Speaking of skipping out on things, Chantelise forces you to fight and kill every enemy in an area before moving on. This means if you're at the top level of an area and the monster walks off the ledge stupidly you now have to jump down after it to kill it and then WALK ALL THE WAY BACK UP TO WHERE YOU WERE. And enjoy the flying enemies and the ones that go invulnerable most of the time they fight you.  I mentioned before that the game is hard. Removing the terrible camera perspective, your combat options are just so limited and weak. Your attack can get a charged version if you equip an item for it (sac'ing stats in the process of course) but otherwise you just have your 1-2-3 and jump attack. Otherwise you'll be using magic and dodging. The magic in this game is actually solid. I like it. But what ends up happening is since your dodge is complete ♥♥♥♥ and has no invicibility to make up for its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ distance, boss fights end up being you farming adds for gems, maintaining distance, and pelting the boss with magic. Super tedious.  tl;dr If you like simple anime storylines just YT this game or find a way to cheat because this game is a waste of your time to actually play. And the story's like 20 minutes long anyway."
70500,Diamond Dan,"I didnt really get it, Its kinda an obscure puzzle platformer.         YouTube™ Video:  Lets Look At : Diamond Dan&nbsp;"
70620,Worms Crazy Golf,"Surprisingly not bad. While it lacks some of the charm of the rest of the Worms series, the pleasant graphics and innovative hole design make it a solid way to kill a few hours."
70640,Worms,"Not the game I thought I was purchasing, but that's my fault for not paying closer attention (I intended to buy Reloaded, but that'll have to wait as I'm on a tight budget for the immediate future). It looks like crap, to the point where I could barely tell what I was looking at, and is glitchy and not fun to play at all. Not recommended at all. 0/10."
70650,Worms Blast,BoggyB - Winner of the Team17 Magazine for 'Worm of the Year'.
70660,Worms Pinball,"It functions fine and all, but there are so many modern pinball games that have tons of extra bells and whistles. There's just not a lot of substance to keep someone engaged. If you're a huge fan of the franchise, then it might be worth a look, but otherwise, pass on this one."
70900,Star Ruler,i played 8 hours of this in the first day and then had fever dreams and the worst night of sleep possible   10/10 would destroy myself again  be careful
71000,Evochron Mercenary,"This game is incredibly complicated and difficult to get into. However if you're the sort of person who thrives off of complex gameplay and carefully planned moves, this is for you. It plays almost like a free-ranged EVE Online without the huge playerbase."
7110,Jade Empire: Special Edition,So I know I do not have a whole lot of game time logged but I played this game a lot on Xbox and the PC port is great. I love this game. The story is outstanding and the game play is enjoyable. I am sure this game will not disappointed you

71240,SEGA Bass Fishing,"Suit up for combat in exoskeletons that evolve every aspect of a soldier's battle readiness, enabling combatants to deploy with an advanced lethality and eliminating the need for specialization. Players experience enhanced player movement and verticality through boost jumps and grappling, covert cloaking abilities, and biomechanics that provide unparalleled strength, awareness, endurance, and speed. With the advent of the exoskeleton and newly advanced armor and weaponry, every soldier commands tactical freedom in any terrain unlike ever before, fundamentally changing the way gamers play SEGA Bass Fishing across all modes."
71250,Sonic Adventure DX,"A classic among classics. Definitely one I've logged many hours into as a kid. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game and no one can change that. 6 different characters 6 ways to play and infinite possibilities. If you love Sonic, this game is a must-have!"
71260,Space Channel 5: Part 2,"Is it just me, or is this game out of sync? Yeh I really think it is."
71340,Sonic Generations,"It's an enjoyable game,just a few things I dislike about it. The Sonic 06 levels are just like the ones from Sonic 06 itself. Pure Hell. It'd be nice to never be reminded of Sonic 06 ever again. It brings me to much PTSD.Other than that everythings good."
7200,TrackMania United Forever,"The additional environments are great, but there are few servers using them."
72000,Closure,"Went back to finish this over the holidays, and remembered how much I enjoyed it. A solid puzzle game with an interesting core mechanic, nicely explored, with additional mechanics added at a reasonable pace. Usually not too difficult (but sometimes too difficult), and the art is creepy and interesting."
7210,Runaway: A Road Adventure,"Though I can see that a lot of work have been put into making this game, I could not finish it.   I found both main characters horribly annoying and cursed at Gina more than once in the short time I played the game. Cut scenes and episodes of talking where nothing could be done where too long and the dialogue was uninteresting.   It could be that I at this time did not have the patience for it.  However, some pros: The story seemed promising. Nice artwork. Easy controls. (Though no guides or tutorials)"
7220,Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle,"Was enjoying this until i got to chapter 4, then it lagged to the point of being unplayable. Disappointing."
72400,Clones,"This is the first Lemmings successor to capture the fun of the original, and it improves on it in every way. If you liked Lemmings, I highly recommend this."
7260,Loki,"Let's get this out of the way - Loki is NOT Diablo 3. It's not even Titan Quest. But it IS an addicting and fun hack and slash RPG. It's got some minor quibbles, clunkiness, and missteps but all in all what we have here is a darn good Diablo clone sprinkled with a splash of Norse, Aztec, and Egyptian mythology and peppered with some novel ideas. For 10 bucks. you aren't going to do much better to satisfy your Action RPG click-fest desires!"
72850,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Demands 45% of mod revenue despite literally doing nothing, and never fixing the myriad of bugs in their core game over the last 5 years. Avoid this publisher if you want to avoid supporting paid-mods and lack of developer support!"
72900,Winter Voices,"Buggier than a Southern summer. I, in my short time trying to play this game, had my character's sprite randomly shift to an adjacent tile dozens of times (when this happens, you need to exit the game to fix it), instantly won a battle by randomly spawning at the end of a minefield instead of at the beginning, and crashed to desktop countless times. These and other bugs happened on a nearly minute-by-minute basis. This is the level of quality you'd expect from a PRE-alpha build.  Even if you can get past the constant storm of bugs, there isn't much here. All missions are either 'Get to this location,' or 'Survive for n turns.'  TL;DR, save your money."
73010,Cities in Motion,"Its great if you like Trams that always get jammed for NO reason. Everyone is stuck behind them :( Simple glitch im sure to fix, but makes the game unplayable with all the Tram requests."
73020,Majesty 2 Collection,"I discovered this game by accident a while ago and am so glad I did.  It is a novel concept, in that you don't directly control the heroes, but you can influence them to do what you want by setting quests for them and building shops so they can better equip. This alone is a great part of the game. Throw in the wit, the decent learning curve, and the simplicity of the game mechanics and you've got a game I go back to again and again."
73060,Defenders of Ardania,"This game seems like they set out to make a really good TD, got about 80% of the way through, and just said 'good enough' and launched. Constant bugs, such as the requirement that you disable all secondary monitors and video cards. Missing features, even simple ones like windowed mode and a range of resolutions. Horrible UI. Unskippable, extended dialogue at the beggining and end of chapters. Unexplained, but crucial, game mechanics. And an unsurprising complete lack of multiplayer presence.  Honestly, buy Defence Grid or something along those lines. Even with it's lack of offence, it's objectively a better game. Or just play 'Use Map Settings' on Starcraft 2, or even Warcraft 3. Gem TD on WC3, and other maps like it, are better than this game.  But that's just my oppinion, others may feel differently."
73190,Pride of Nations,This is still the worse game on the entire Steam store. Please do not support this company.
73210,Sengoku,"Plays like a half-finished Crusader Kings without any DLC. The winning strategy is to start blobbing and continue blobbing, because blobbing gives you resources to blob faster."
73220,Supreme Ruler Cold War,"The game is great. The grand strategy aspects, the backstory, the space race, etc.  But what made this a negative review, was the   PERFORMANCE.    PROS +Good war and diplomacy system. +It has the space race. +The ability to play as nearly every sovereign state that existed in the cold war. CONS -Mindwrenchingly terrible performance. (We're talking 2-10 FPS).  Could have been a great game, but the terrible performance ironically outperforms all.  6/10  UPDATE: Rating has been heighted to 6/10. Found out performance problems are mostly fixable by third party patches (Fistalis Mods)."
7340,Azada,"Steam Really Needs a Neutral Option.   I got this mainly because of the rave reviews - and I found it disappointing.   Pros: They really did put a lot of effort into the game play and graphics.   After you unlock puzzle types you can go to a room and replay just that puzzle type without have to go through the whole pages part of the main story. Might be good for Kids.  No problems with bugs or anything like that.   Cons:  The puzzels seemed to get boring after awhile. The aged paper/colors seemed to half put me to sleep sometimes. Not the relaxing pleasent feeling I was expecting.   The Hidden Object Puzzles just didn't work for me. And I play a LOT of Hidden Object Games - and still a lot of times it was difficult to figure out what they wanted without (and sometimes with) the Hint button. An example is in one place you need to 'spell' out one long word. The only thing is that the clues for the word are letters on 4 different peices of paper. ummm. Also the 'story' really isn't interesting so working out the final solution was also sort of meh.   I don't see any replay value - although some people seem to.   For $10, I feel the game is too pricy. On sale not so bad. Still I do feel frustrated."
7510,X-Blades,"Played this on PS3 and got the Platinum Trophy. Love the gamestyle and artwork. Been playing it on PC with controller and it looks even beter. Runs perfect with 120fps on my pc with high settings, I got a i5-6400 and GTX 1060 6GB"

7530,Two Worlds II Castle Defense,Ayy that's pretty good
7600,Sid Meier's Railroads!,"I do enjoy the game, though it crashes on Windows 10. Random times, into the game. I do still recommend it, just hoping that the developers make a patch to fix it."
7610,Railroad Tycoon 3,"First, anybody who goes after the game should keep in mind that it is 13 years old. Even with that age it is still one of the best railroad games created thus far. Granted, this game is not as competitive as games like Transport Fever or what Railroad Tycoon 2 was. The A.I. is not all that bright and will not give you much of a challenge most of the time. This game is for the casuel railroader who wants to run trains and maybe troll the A.I. a bit. Still, I recommend this game without a second thought.   As a final note, if you are having trouble running this game on the windows 64-bit. There is a patch linked in community chats that will likely solve that issue, it is easy to install and resolves the issue fast."
7620,Railroad Tycoon 2: Platinum,"I've played Railroad Tycoon since the first version, not great at it, but have fun. Thought I'd relay this story.  I started a passenger/mail train running from Minneapolis to Seattle in the late 1800's. Jesse James robs the first run, I'm annoyed, but figure OK, it's a one off. The next one will surely give me the big payoff. Second run takes off, Jesse James robs it again, wondering where the US cavalry are and why they aren't protecting my assets. Third run, this one has to make it, Jesse James robs it again! Who the hell do I have to bribe in the government to get some protection here?!  Finally, the news arrives! Jesse James has been caught, yay! I will finally see that route pay off the way I expected from the start. Fourth train takes off from the station, steaming along, no Jesse James in sight, woohoo! Then Indians attack it!   10/10 Would set up the Minneapolis/Seattle run again!"
7650,X-COM: Terror from the Deep,Old school classic running on a modern OS. Games these days aren't nearly as hard as this one - get it if you want a real challenge. Just make sure you download the strategy guide to avoid any research bugs.
7660,X-COM: Apocalypse,"Loved the game when it was released - played it alot. Wanted to play it again.  Was greeted with screen resolution problems. Didn't wan't to spend x hours/mins of tweaking dosbox to make it work so I uninstalled it.  Might work for you, or it might not. Personaly I was expecting an working game when I got it from steam. But it didn't work on my comp. So do expect some modding on it if you are unlucky like I was."
7670,BioShock,"Amazing.  There is art here, despite what many would say isn't possible with games, from Roger Ebert to game designers like Hideo Kojima. But it's in BioShock - it's in the gorgeously realized, watery halls of Rapture. It's in a Little Sister's expression of thanks when you choose to save her, or the utter silence if you harvest instead. It's in the way the characters develop, in the testimonials of the recording boxes you pick up along the way. It's in the way the narrative is structured, and the way it blends so seamlessly with the action.   Irrational had a clear vision with this game, something pulled off with remarkable precision in every department. They didn't just deliver something that's fun to play, a criterion so often cited as the benchmark of what makes a game worthwhile. BioShock stands as a monolithic example of the convergence of entertaining gameplay and an irresistibly sinister, engrossing storyline that encompasses a host of multifaceted characters. This is an essential gaming experience."
7730,X-COM: Interceptor,"I can not recommend this game, on the other hand I can not not recommend this game. It's... complicated. Before I start explaining, let me link this  XKCD  [imgs.xkcd.com]  comic.  X-COM interceptor is a bad game, but in some peculiar way, enjoyable. Put simply: it's so bad it's good. I can not in good faith recommend it, because it's bad, on the other hand I can't not recommend it, because it's possible that you may enjoy it.  On strategic side, it's a typical X-COM styled game, adapted to specific environment. You build bases, expand them with modules, research techs (story-wise you download them from Galactic Science Corps, gameplay wise it's just like research in every other such game), you hire pilots, buy craft, weapons and equipment, and send them to intercept UFOs.  Combat is centred about classic dogfighting, with 'air drag', max speed and other such elements which are staple of oldschool dogfighting, but make no sense in space. Not that it's unusual for 'space' flight sim, a lot are guilty of that and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Word of warning, combat is very fast paced, so fast that it takes some time to get used to. That's not a problem though, your wingmen are very capable and will win fights for you, until you start carrying your own weight.  That's about facts, but what makes it enjoyable? Hard to say, attempts at humour are corny, reading 'news from Earth' will make you groan or facepalm, interface is clunky because it pretends to be retro-futuristic in-universe screens/displays, combat repetitive and simplistic which leaks into strategic layer also making it simplistic. Still, campaign is short, individual missions rarely take more then minute, big chunk of which is 'fly in', and 'hyperspace out' animations, and this is probably what saves Interceptor: it's too short to bore you (too much).  All in all, it's very subjective, I give negative review because it's bad, but I did enjoy it in a way, maybe you will too?    Side note: there's a bug that makes enemy installations impossible to kill, it's solved in unofficial .exe patch, but launching Interceptor with this exe prevented Steam from properly logging my playtime, hence so low value - contrary to what Steam says, I did play game from start to end."
7760,X-COM: UFO Defense,"Great old-school game. Ideal blend of strategy, a bit of rpg, huge database of information about aliens, their weapons and crafts. Really enjoyed playing it."
7770,X-COM: Enforcer,"I recommend this game BUT... if your looking for a xcom, squad, turn based, tactical, base building, research doing, equipment building game this is NOT the game for you and you will probably hate it. I bought it a few months ago and it was as all the old xcom game 1 game for 5$ or all 5 games for 15$ (3$ each). For 5$ there are probobly better steam games but for 3$ as a bundle how can I say no even if you only get a few hours of life out of it. The game suffers similar problems to The Bureau but more so. The Bureau as least has many of the classic parts of the game just the semi turn based part throws it off. Any how...  Yes I recommend the game and its meta score maybe and over exageration of how good it is. If your looking for a quick, simple, 'shooter', alien blasting and an awesome robot that takes devestates robots as well as a sectopod 1v1 any 1 of your soldiers this is the game for you. Take vengance for all those times in all xcom games where the alien dominate you becauase now your the one doing the dominating. The hardness setting do not make the game much harder. You 1 shot with your laser rifle which has unlimited ammo as your would with a mid tech rifle in any game most basic humanoids. The power ups and ammo based weapons some are lack luster and some are game breakingly awesome. As in getting tactical nukes that can have multiple shots or time stoping all enemies for 10 seconds. Your robot named Enforcer... can be upgraded which is the only tactical part of the game as in what to upgrade when. You can upgrade your speed, jumping, max ammo and hp. You also can upgrade a variety of buff items to enhance them and also your limited ammo weapons (which is everything except your basic attack). My favorite weapon and I recommend maxxing it out first is the Mass Driver. It combines decent firing speed and accuracy of a rifle with the minor splash, aoe and penetration of say a grenade launcher. 1st upgrades to your robot I suggest are improved jump and some speed. To be fair it as an ok attempt to make a 'shooter' but when ever a game series that is well established changed game play like this it usually turns out people hate it. People want same but different not different but similar.  Pros: Game is short, can win in a few hours once you have done it before Levels are short, about 5-15 minutes, good if you have short time Upgrade self as say enemy within Awesome stats No hit locations Fairly mindless playing Semi hidden bonus money and bonus level items (1st play through found 90% of them and 2nd time them all) Bonus level (they are sort of mini games to earn more money after every level if you find the hidden bonus level item. Some are annoyin some earn tons of money. Most are fun enough and have a 60 second timer. Such as 1 is pack man with you in place of pack man and 1 is frogger like ect) No psionics! As in you are a robot so basicly immune in all games to it. In enemy unkown there are a few exceptions that can hit robots and the High ethereal do have some that can hit you. But not mindcontrol or panic! The enforcer to fight aliens is a great idea. High defence probably too much making it too easy vs standard aliens when you have 400 hp and they are doing less than 5 per shot Some replay value Skins! Multiplayer (for the perpose that you can still play it with out an other player but start on any level for fun)  Cons: Too easy most of the time except a few bosses which can be quit tough No hit locations Fairly mindless playing, getting sort of repetative objectives for most levels Very little story line besides intro, near ending and ending Way too many items spawn for you to use making it almost laughably easy most of the time Not a strategy game as said above!"
78000,Bejeweled 3,WARNING! This game is addicting! :-D Definitely the best bejeweled game in the whole universe
7830,Men of War,"I like this game , mission is just too hard even when played on easy"
7840,Death Track: Resurrection,"An exceedingly difficult combat racing game. I was not able to finish the campaign. I don't remember much else about it, but as memory goes I can't recommend it."
7860,NecroVisioN,"Beginning of story is rough. It seems to skip a bit in order to reach a cool cinematic. But by and large, you have to read between the lines a bit to fully understand the (at times) disjointed dialogue and narration.   Aside from questionable writing and story connection, we have the gameplay. Controls are rough, clunky and sometimes counter intuitive. The shooting is haphazard and rushed, enemies taking 3 .45cal rounds in the gut just to stop shooting is ridiculous. The even more ridiculous part is that enemies also take 3 bursts from a mounted machine gun to drop. So the muntions do the same amount of damage between a pistol and a mounted weapon??  I could go on describing things I found in my short playtime, but it was on sale and that's pretty much the only positive part. I can say I got a game for a dollar. Probably won't play it much unless I really feel the need to finish the story."
7940,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"This game's longevity is much attributed to two things: Really good core concept gunplay, and the fact that you can host a dedicated server. The developers realized after CoD 4 that their games weren't dying out fast enough for people to want the next game every year, so they took out host/client and went with the easily inferior peer to peer networking solution. This ensures that hackers can assume complete control of lobbies, effectively ruining the experience of countless gamers and killing off the game community much faster (See: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and its successors).  But CoD 4 doesn't have this problem. Servers are still owned by actual human beings who maintain blacklists of banned hackers, making for a much improved gameplay experience. At the time of this review CoD 4 is 8 years old, and the community is as strong as it ever was. This game is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the Call of Duty franchise. Plus, 64+ player servers? That's something you never experienced on console, and trust me, you have to. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***FINAL EDIT:*** With a heavy heart I must now say that none of what was previously written is relevant any more, but posterity needs to know about a new form of royal asshaterry that is going on within the dev realm.  I will need to change the review to thumbs down because the game mysteriously recieved an update recently that purposely cut global search and the anti-cheat service out of the game. This has obviously been done so that you will have a reason to buy the re-make. In other words, they purposely stopped people from playing a game they already own so that they will need to re-buy it again ten years later. To put it as clean as I can, I am god damn disappointed.  The golden age of games has passed away and taken this game and many other beautiful examples with it, and it is the Triple A companies that are killing our hobbies as a whole for the sake of money. Please, please boycott this franchise. There are many shady moves devs nowadays will pull on gamers to make a quick buck, but this is unacceptable."
80,Counter-Strike: Condition Zero,"~ I grew up with this game and 1.6 , so much memories :&gt; 10 / 10"
8000,Tomb Raider: Anniversary,"A great update of the original Tomb Raider that started it all. It has all of the needed elements and none of the extras (annoying radio commentary, gore, horror- etc) would have made a great starting point for the new games."
80000,APOX,its ok... not exactly recommended.. sslow paced game. I prefer fast paced like command and conquer... ETC. 6/10
80200,Fate of the World,Cheap games ain't sht. Add here Democracy 3 too
80300,Puzzle Bots,"This was adorable as my dreams. I love robots a lot, so i spontaniously bought it. I loved it. I read out the robot's little text boxes and got the crap scared outta me when Hero spoke. I could critique the human characters all day, and how their plots are mostly irrelivant or not fleshed out enough, but the robots were the real stars!!! Robts!!!!!!!!!!! Tiny friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Definitely drawing fanart."
80310,Gemini Rue,A great game from WadjetEyeGames. Unlike Primordia or Shardlight the puzzles aren't that hard to solve and therefor is great for a bigger playerbase.(Sometimes it's about finding the correct pixels and most of the time it's quite obvious what to do.) While playing it turns out you are able to switch between Characters and at the end of the game you finally get to know how those people are connected-&gt;You will never expect that.  Great Story. From my perspective one of the best Point and Clicks. I hope WadjetEyeGames will produce more such games as they have proven to make really good dystopian games.
80330,The Blackwell Legacy,"Definitely not for the price!  I would say that each of these Blackwell games I have played belong in a complete came, at one price!  They have been interesting, but very short."
80350,Blackwell Convergence,"About 50% longer than the previous Blackwell games, it's also the easist, clocking in at 2 hours or less. While still a fun enough game, don't expect to be challenged, and while you can play this without having played the previous games, much of the enjoyment comes from the continuation of the Blackwell story. A good light game if you can get it on sale."
80360,Blackwell Deception,"Forth, longest, worst. That's sums it up. Like the other Blackwell games, it leaves things open for yet another sequal. If you play all four games back to back, they get close to the length you'd expect a single game to be. Deception, despite not being a departure in any respect from the others, 'feels' like worse game."
8040,Championship Manager 2007,"i've played this game about 300+ hours but its original cased game, not on steam (my brother gift it on steam last month)  pros + not complicated as new manager games + detailed attirbutes + more realistic matches (i dont refer graphics) than new manager games  + not needs high reqs + you can analize matches with ProZone + huge and detailed database (you can see icelandic free agent players)  cons - matches looks like table-football matches - childish menus ,fonts and bad themes - it ruins your life :(  note : we want cm 14!!!"
8060,Championship Manager 2008,"This game is a little bit complicated but easy to learn. Its fully licensed but no player pictures or anything fancy. Its a very immersive game that you play for hours instead of just picking it up on the go, and is rather fun. Its surprisingly realistic and interesting. Pros: Lots of options, Easy to manage, Decent results (cough) Overall review: 7.5/10"
8080,Kane & Lynch: Dead Men," Kane and Lynch: Dead Men  have everything I like in a shooter, except for the bad AI, DRM and only local co-op. But these are just the bad aspects of this amazing game, Kane and Lynch are much more as a duo!  Kane is a man on the death row, but the sins of his past wouldn't let him die just like that, no. He had to suffer, so it starts. Meting Lynch sure shake things up, a psychopath heavenly inspired by  Waingro , a character in the movie  Heat . This fantastic duo sets foot on a path fueled by revenge and the uncontrollable need to fix Kane's family, her ex-wife and daughter kidnapped by The 7, a group of top worldwide gangsters. This is the starting line; travel the world hunting down The 7, and shooting mobs of enemies.  No doubt a huge hit by IO Interactive, a cover-based shooter with intense violence and major Holywood influences like  Heat . Although we only play as Kane, Lynch is definitely still there, together with some friends we pick up on the line. As an action game every level is priceless, from the start bank heist, to the prison breakout, or even the very famous night club shootout in Japan. Each moment in this game is amazing, the level design always makes me go back and replay it. The stressful situations, Lynch looses it, the innocent people screaming... Such great free violence only video-games can provide!   The gameplay quality, however, makes me feel sad this had to be an issue... For starters the AI is terrible, and we're talking about some big issues here; enemies stop in the middle of the fight, your teammates without a clue where to go, the hitboxes are a huge mess...If this was not bad enough, the physics have issues too. Throwing a grenade can be challenging, you never know where they go by hitting an invisible wall or just crazy physics blocking their way. Although we shoot most of the time, the hitboxes are the biggest issue for me, and make it almost impossible to hit enemies at some distances. Being a console port doesn't help much either, the visual and performance options are there, but seem to make little difference in improvements! From all the negative feedback, the DRM is probably the main reason, choosing GFWL wasn't a good idea in the long run plan, but the game still works (surprisingly). I tend to forget about all of this when I'm playing  Kane and Lynch: Dead Men , with such good maps, and a story line worth of a TV Show, every problem gets swelling down, almost like every pill Lynch takes. The soundtrack is worth a being checked out, and suits perfectly with the tension of the campaign. Co-Op action is still available, but local only, and that's a shame because the game does offer some great co-op moments!  I give  Kane and Lynch: Dead Men  a positive review, but barely... Because the campaign is really good, and the story is so solid, it makes me go back and replay some amazing missions, even though they all play out the same way! There is nothing more powerful than a father seeking revenge!  6/10"
8100,Conflict: Denied Ops,"Completely generic, clunky controls, abyssmal buddy AI, and graphics that look 4 or 5 years too old for the release date. You -might- have fun if you play it with a friend via LAN or VPN, but even then, it's that 'this was bad but it was fun to experience it together' type of fun."
8140,Tomb Raider: Underworld,"I played this game right after playing legend (which comes right before this one). Honestly...I did not like it nearly as much. The graphics are 110% better than legend, but because of that it doesn't run as well on my computer (not horrible...but your computer may struggle if you are like me and are using your day-to-day school laptop). The thing I found most annoying was the controls...jump right /somteimes/ and Luara jumps left...just back and laura jumps up...getting stick inside bricks...and the large amount of bugs (play with a guide- it will tell you what not to do). I did enjoy the game, but these factors really conributed to me not liking it nearly as much. However, the ending does leave a nice resolution from legend, so I recommend at least playing through this game afterward so you can see what happens (since legend is on such a clifhanger).  So yes- I recommend this game, but only after playing legend."
8170,Battlestations: Pacific,"It's old but still good game, not worth so much money but u can have fun with the friends for few or more hours"
8190,Just Cause 2,"COMPLETIONISTS BEWARE!  Incredibly buggy for people who want to 100% this game. I was unable to complete several side missions due to glitches that have been well documented since the game's release. (See Black Gold bug, missing destructables required to for completion, the glitches/bugs page on the JC2 wikia.) Even out of the box with 0 glitches, it is impossible to 100% I don't understand how a game that boasts a completion percentage on screen very prominantly can neglect the ability to complete the percentage for 7 years."
8260,Sam & Max 201: Ice Station Santa,Best humor game evah!
8270,Sam & Max 202: Moai Better Blues,"this is the weakest and shortest episode of seson 2. first the babies have interesting background stories, but the game didn't explore them. they babies are just being there doing nothing. second when you backtrack to town , there is nothing going on. stinky, bosco aren't doing anything.  i do recommend this episode, simply to be able to understand what is happening in the following episodes  "
8280,Sam & Max 203: Night of the Raving Dead,"i have finished season 2, somehow steam didn't record my playing time   i don't think this is immersive enough. Sam and Max travelled all the way to Stutgart in Germany, why can't they just stay there and interact with locals? this will inject freshness into the game. backtracking to the town is boring , repetitive and ruin the sense of adventure. Sam and Max's neighbors have no business being in this game. "
8290,Sam & Max 204: Chariots of the Dogs,just as good as the other Episodes (played in offlinemode)
8300,Sam & Max 205: What's New Beelzebub?,just as good as the other Episodes (played in offlinemode)
8310,Bone: Out from Boneville,This is not really a bad game but it doesnt do much in ways of justifying its existence. Read the amazing comic insted!
8320,Bone: The Great Cow Race,"If you liked the first one, may as well play this one. More solid puzzles and treats for fans of the comic. Only negative is the abrupt ending. Wish they woul've made more of these."
8330,Telltale Texas Hold'Em,"I suppose you could say that I accidentally bought this one, as there was a sale on and it was part of a package. I'm not a poker player but I think this is more for a casual player, with some humour injected through tabletalk. Not for me."
8340,Strong Bad Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner,"  If you aren't a Homestar Runner fan, go watch the cartoons, then come back to this. It's a decent and fun adventure game, but a non-fan of the series wouldn't enjoy it as much. Shame they never made Season 2, and with Telltale moving to more mature games I doubt there ever will.   The game runs unusually. I say this because my laptop uses more power running chrome than this game. It is 8 years old, and the game takes up almost no space. The audio quality is a bit crackly though, but even if you have a wood computer you should still be able to run this no problem"
8350,Strong Bad Episode 2: Strong Badia the Free,"I mean, it's Strong Bad. What's not to like?  Just like the last episode, it's all point and click, in this episode you stick it to the man and set stuff on fire."
8360,Strong Bad Episode 3: Baddest of the Bands,"Dear Strong bad,  Please come back to the internet full time, we miss you.   Your friend with benifits, Miss galaxy  I enjoyed all of these episodes, 1st was the best but the others had there moments."
8380,Strong Bad Episode 5: 8-Bit Is Enough,"Dear Strong bad,  Please come back to the internet full time, we miss you.   Your friend with benifits, Miss galaxy  I enjoyed all of these episodes, 1st was the best but the others had there moments."
8400,Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved,"An utterly elemental hall-of-fame game like Tetris, Super Mario, Doom and others which spawned an entire genre of immitators. A one-trick-pony yes, but the near-perfect difficulty curve and impeccable design choices make it a timeless mainstay that will still be a must for any gamer centuries from now, and that is no exaggeration. If you've got a twin-stick gamepad, you MUST have this game."
8500,EVE Online,"Welp, now it is 'Free to Play' While you can download it and play for free they lock any possible way to progress in this game with out getting the 'Omega' access. Which is the Monthly pay micro transaction of doom that ruins so many games... I can understand the need for a transaction function in the game for it to stay alive but scalping players like that by blocking things that you need to go anywhere in the game is un-orthodox, They should instead follow suit of games like World of Tanks or World of Warships. Where you can buy premium items that still pay but mean everybody can progress without need to pay money. It should be pay to progress faster, not pay to progress at all."
8600,RACE 07,"I've had this game for almost 2 years now. I have to say, for something that was made for 2007 I was very impressed.   It's true the multiplayer community is pretty much dead, but my god is this game so good. It has a HUGE variety of cars that I highly doubt you will find in any other racing sim. It has very memorable music, and sound to the game. Yeah maybe it doesn't have the quality you see in recent car games, but this game will work on any computer and it was easy to learn how to play. The learning curve isn't too steep, but it is steep enough to learn how to race and race efficiently (on max difficulty).   For anyone's first time playing racing sims, I highly recommend you start with this little gem to learn the basics of race car driving simulations. This sim takes many things into consideration that even most of the modern games would never do. The camera angles, and TV shots make this game more worth while to play. The hours written on my profile for this game are wrong btw, I've played this game 2 years before I added it's game code to steam. I have around 200+ hours on it approximately.   TL DR;  Pros:  -Huge variety of cars for a variety of diffferent racing formats -Runs on any computer -Difficulty level with the option of 'training wheels' so to speak -Music (this is a true masterpiece) -Loads of Customization for both vehicles, and on tracks -Many, many, maps! -No additional purchasable content, or excessive DLC  Cons:  -No Multiplayer Community -No Steam Achievements -Pit Menu is glitched sometimes -Quality not compared to today's standards -Only weather is ultimately Rain/Sunny "
8790,GTR 2 - FIA GT Racing Game,"Although old GTR2 is still one of the best racing sims out there.  GTR2 is based on the 2003/2004 seasons of the FIA GT Championship, and its base content includes 25 cars &amp; 15 track locations used in those seasons. The game has nice graphics, good sounds, handling of cars is very good, precise &amp; intuitive, controller support is good, and there's lots of mod content available. Graphics can be slightly better than rFactor depending on the mod/track used, and replays generally look better than rFactor. The game only requires 512MB of video memory when run on the highest settings, so even if you have an old PC you should be able to get good graphics in this game. Controller support for Xbox360 controller is pretty good, the default controller settings work well, require precise inputs without being frustrating. Gameplay is very good, there's driving school, 24hr races, championships, or you can simply create custom race weekends with cars &amp; track of your choice, being able to restrict AI to use only specific cars instead of allowing all base cars can make races more interesting imo. There's also weather &amp; time change in all tracks, both of which increase the challenge and make races even more interesting. Base content might seem kind of slim with only 25 cars &amp; 15 track locations, but mods more than make up for it. GTR2 has a lot of mod content (not as much as rFactor, though), there's lots of tracks &amp; cars that can be found on the internet, and the large amount of mod content combined with the excellent gameplay can provide lots of replay value.  I bought Race 07 before buying GTR 2 thinking Race 07 might be better than GTR 2 because of the larger amount of base content. Race 07 is a great game imo, but I think overall GTR2 is better, better gameplay, better car handling &amp; controller support, more mod content, more replay value. Even if you already have Race 07 GTR2 is still worth buying.  GTR2 imo is a must have for fans of sim racing, great gameplay, low price, lots of mods, and it can run fine even on old PCs. Highly recommended."
8800,Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword,"Formerly ranked #1 in the world in 2007-2008. Went through 5 physical copies of the game before I bought the steam version. I've spent years of my life enjoying this games single and multiplayer...12 hour multiplayer games, 36 hour single player games, 5 minute duels. I couldn't recommend a better game.  Civ V is complete and utter trash. VI doesn't look much better. If you want maximum control, go Civ IV (or III). Unit stacking is king. The only downside is that there aren't many people to play with online and frankly, most of them are very very bad (wide skill gap)."
8850,BioShock 2, BioShock 2 Review
8870,BioShock Infinite,My mind has been blown.
8880,Freedom Force,"Controlled so terribly that I gave up after 20 minutes on the tutorial. The fact that my character kept walking through solid objects, ignored my commands and the sound intially did not work leads me to believe that the game is a buggy mess on modern hardware...at least I hope."
8890,Freedom Force vs. the 3rd Reich,The introduction of the Kill-a-rilla make this game especially relevant for our time. ♥♥♥♥♥ out for Harambe.
8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,Napoleon always backstabs.   10/10 would get backstabbed by Napoleon again.
8970,Axel & Pixel,"I enjoyed playing though this game, although it doesn't quite seem to be puzzles aimed for adults. Still, the atmosphere is quite nice, I definately enjoyed playing through it. The soundtrack is epic!"

9000,Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny,Wolfenstein 3D Spear of Destiny may have an awesome title but how good is it as an expansion pack/prequel I think it was pretty good but there are some odd design choices  Pros  New ammo pickup item new textures new enemys redifened enemy sprites and new weapon designs 3 episodes packed with 18 levels each with secret levels Secrets that are actualy well hidden with actual clues to help you find them hidden in the enviorment New and for the most part really fun boss battles  A really crazy ending to say the least  A good chunk of the levels are very well designed  Cons  Not gonna lie it's cool to have more textures but why so much blue 80% of everything in the last 2 episodes is blue the walls the nazis the dogs and your guns its just odd Mandatory secrets are kinda lame Some of the levels are just bad Bubbles aka the worst texture ever In episode 3 one of the new enemys is given a redisgn and turned into green mist (I'm not kidding) They replaced the chain gun sound effect :( (the tune you here when you pick up the chaingun) One final nitpick all 3 episodes are the same story wise and have the same final boss to which is kinda lazy but then again who plays Wolf3D for the story?  So to summarize despite some nitpicks I could still recommend this game It's more or less Wolf3D again but it's a bit more well refinied in a few areas and I had lots of fun playing through all three episodes so I'd deffinetly reccomend this game. The best way to get this one would be through the wolf Pack
9010,Return to Castle Wolfenstein,"I was playing this long ago back on celeron 550 with Voodoo 4500, good times. I saw this in the STEAM store and looked on my shelf @ the my retail copy still in it's original box and thought 'why not?' For all I know the old retail version doesn't work with Windows 10 anyway.    Great classic shooter.. Alarms are going off.. Nazi commander walks out of the nearby room walking around like he heard a floor board squeak. 'Zwhat Waz zat?'"

90400,Blue Toad Murder Files - The Mysteries of Little Riddle,"Well, it's not like it's a bad game. I mean, it has some funny dialogue and some of the puzzles aren't bad. Unfortunatily those moments are too far in between. The story is not very interesting, and the most of the puzzels are very easy. The graphics aren't bad for this kind of game, and they blend well with the silly characters. It's just it gets boring after a couple of hours. Although it's not that bad of a game i wouldn't recommend this game unless you are really into british humor and this kind of game."
9050,DOOM 3,"Played this with the Perfected mod; my hours don't show.  This is a classic worth trying. It's aged well, mainly due to its excellent blend of FPS and horror. With the exception of the nonsense jumpscares - of which, to be fair, there are many - the game impressively creates suspense while also pounding you with action. Play on high volume and difficulty."
90500,Guardians of Graxia,"I was on skid row doing 40 ampoules of crack a day til I found this game. It totally changed my life, now I'm a CEO of a major international conglomerate thanks to ' GUARDIANS OF GRAXIA!'"
9060,HeXen II," What I liked about the game   • Nice to see Hexen in a full 3D world. The game has brilliant and complex level design. My favourite hub was probably the first one.  • Smart A.I. When I was using the staff and the grenades the enemies were hard to hit because they kept dodging my projectiles.  • Hexen 2 has new classes, this time round I played as the assassin. Each class has their own unique weapons; four weapons each. The classes also have their own special ability's, for example with the assassin you can do critical damage by sneaking up on your foes. You can level up by killing enemies which increases your health and mana. There's plenty of replayability. • There's a boss at the end of each hub, you also encounter new enemies in each hub. New powerups as well.    What I disliked or was disappointed with   • Bugs and glitches. I've encountered enemies freezing and being unable to kill them. Half way through the 2nd hub I was unable to walk backwards and use the teleporter. The last boss kept getting stuck and after I defeated him I was unable to read the story's conclusion.  • The puzzles in hexen 2 can be very frustrating. The most frustrating hub in the whole of the Hexen series was probably the 3rd hub in Egypt; I kept getting stuck and having to resort to looking on youtube. The game is also very challenging even on normal. One of the problems I had was I used a lot of my items in the boss battles and both my mana and health were drained making the last two hubs very difficult.  • No soundtrack.  • Unfortunately you can't use the mouse to look up and down without pressing and keeping hold of a key. I used mouse 2 to look up and down. I couldn't find any patch or mod to fix this you will have to customize the controls first before you start.    Conclusion    The weakest in the series. The difficulty and the frustration of that Egypt hub ruined the game a bit for me and you also have the bugs and glitches throughout the game. I recommend you buy this game when it's heavily discounted and also I recommend you give the demo a try as well to see what I mean by the problems with the controls. It's worth giving it a try for that unique combination of FPS and puzzle solving, especially if you really enjoyed the first Hexen.    60/100 (Not modded)"
91100,SkyDrift,"Able to play some of the tutorial but then the screen severely glitches out. What little I have been able to play is promising, but unable to do anything then about half the tutorial."
91200,Anomaly Warzone Earth,Excellent game and worthy purchase
91330,Iron Front : Liberation 1944,This probably has to be the worst game I've ever played. Never buy this game. It may look cool but it is glitchy and crap. The AI sucks too.
9160,Master Levels for DOOM II,Really Really Good
91600,Sanctum,"Was fun at first to play online with friends and work together. Then came a patch which undid all the things that made it enjoyable to play. Stopped playing after that and abandoned it completely.  Waste of money, developers should not be allowed to ruin a game with mandatory patches. "
91700,E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy,"I want this game to be so much better than it is... It is frustrating when you die and end up 4 missions back from when you died, especially when the thing that killed you gave no warning (not even a sound, just a red screen and then a loading bar) before doing so.  This is supposed to be a traditionally hardcore shooter, but the things that supposedly make it hardcore instead just make it stupid. To make it 'hardcore', I'd recommend removing the resurrector completely, reducing the amount of ammo you are allowed to utilize during an individual mission, and then fixing all of the idiocy of the A.I. and polishing the actual mechanics of the game.  It's a solid game, but the issues add up fast. Bugs aren't the issue; I haven't run into a bug yet. The issues lie with the game itself. There is only ever really one approach to beating each mission: kill everything that isn't marked as an ally. The other methods of completing objectives are much harder than mowing down enemies with big guns and grenades, and provide fewer benefits. Hacking a bank dispenser gives you less experience and money than just standing next to the bank dispenser and killing the spawning waves of enemies.   Rating of implementation for various things:   Menus? You have to figure them out a bit, but once you do it's simple to see they did a great job here. 7/10.   Cybernetics? I love that these all actually make sense and that careful observation will show a noticeable difference upon upgrading them. They're much too expensive, however. 7/10.   Research? The element of mystery is something they should keep, to some degree, but the cost outweighs the benefits most of the time. 7/10.   Lore? Take Warhammer 10k (not 40k) and then spice it up with some major Deus Ex, then twist the whole thing until it's only recognizable by the threads that link things together. Decent, but a little too vague and washed-out. Also, there's almost zero backstory for any part of the game. 6/10.   Gameplay? The epic feeling of rolling around in heavy armor with a minigun and trashing hordes of monsters and men alike is interrupted annoyingly every time anyone ever carries an armor-piercing weapon. You cannot survive single-player without heavy armor, either. Every resource uses the same pool of energy, which is a huge detractor from the game for anyone wanting to use psychic powers or even for the folks that want to sprint everywhere to make things go faster. That's it's own point; the game is slow as molasses even though action is constant, which is amazing (in a bad way) in its own right. The game has some pacing issues, and there needs to be a clearer sense of development for the characters you interact with, and that's before mentioning your own personal character lacking any sort of depth beyond 'don't trust mentor' and talking to yourself. I'm surprised enemies don't go insane from fighting a juggernaut with a minigun that blew up half their allies into chunks of gore, too, since a single carnophage that does no damage to me (blocked with my sword) made me go insane and start shooting randomly once I pulled out my gun; maintenance as a super easy fix to this actually makes it amusing rather than scary, however... And insanity isn't exactly something I'd prefer to pull my humor from. 3/10.   Bugs? I haven't found any, but I'm placing 'color scheme' here; this is more of a personal issue, but I can't tell apart most things in this game due to the coloration. I can see text and screens in-game, but I cannot see the monsters or people without using cyber vision or the second zoom of the sniper rifle. It's supposed to be cyberpunk and/or steampunk but it really just comes across as dirty and otherwise empty. Upping the brightness doesn't help. 7/10.    Overall Rating: I'll put it somewhere around 6/10. It's a decent game, but the group of people that will enjoy it is likely much smaller than the group that will be dissapointed by the difference between the reality of the game and the potential of what it could have been.   It should be noted that the game is pretty cheap, so if you're buying it during a 75% or 50% sale, I would instead recommend it. I mean, it's worth at least $5."
9180,Commander Keen Complete Pack,Commander Keen 1 was the first video game I ever played. I was 6 years old. To this day it is still one of my favorties.
91800,Cloning Clyde,This game is short but amazing.
91810,Ancients of Ooga,"Although the game reminds me of Crash Bandicoot, it certainly doesn't play like Crash Bandicoot. Either there was something wrong with my computer but the game played terribly. With no graphical options to speak of (no even resolution), the game played slow and clunky. it felt like i had lag the entire time. played with a HD 7750, which runs most games like Mirror's Edge on medium. But not this game for some odd reason."
91900,Post Apocalyptic Mayhem,"Not enough players online reliably, no splitscreen, and there is no 'campaign' mode. Its just bot single player. But if you are starved for car combat its worth picking up for cheap."
9200,RAGE,"Avoided it until now due to the bad reviews, especially with AMD graphics cards. Truly an underrated game and runs flawlessly at 1080p and high textures with my 'ancient' HD5850. 23 GIG install is a heavy price to pay though."
92000,Hydrophobia: Prophecy,"It's an okay game. Story line is a little hard to follow, the ending is a huge cliff hanger though."
92100,DETOUR,"Good concept riddled with transphobia, unpredictable A.I. behavior, and going from 'baby's first RTS' to 'BRUTAL HARD' mode with no in-between, nobody's playing it so no available multiplater and no generation for random vs A.I. battles (other than baby's first and brutal hard mode). Seriously, was naming the transgender character 'Tranny' necissary?! Why is this allowed to be sold on steam?"
92210,Hitogata Happa,i played it for less than 20 minutes and already ive destroyed half my home out of pure anger generated by this game! thanks hitogata happa!!
92220,GundeadliGne,"This game may feel quick due to 5 levels,but the challenges and unlockables will keep you up for more time."
92300,A.R.E.S.,It's total ♥♥♥
92400,B.U.T.T.O.N.,I wish if they make sequel of this game.
92600,Xotic,"Very nice. Very relaxing. Its like an Unreal-setting, smooth ambient music and sounds, you have a gun you can upgrade and your avatar. You try to get as high score as possible.   You get bonuses by triggering chain reactions. This is pew pew-The Game.   I'm looking foward to a sequel!"
92700,Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,Thank goodness it was on sale.
92800,SpaceChem,"I love cerbral games like this. If you find certain puzzle games to be too easy or tedious, I'm betting you'll enjoy this fresh breath of air.  However, I cannot currently recommend as the windowed mode is broken with a two-monitor setup. If the dev is able to reach out, I'd be happy to help them fix this bug, which currently makes it impossible for me to play the game."

9310,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Winter Assault","Similar to the original Dawn of War, Winter Assault features linear campaign-driven gameplay. There are two campaigns, order and disorder, and they cover the gameplay for every (at this point in the series) existing race except for the Space Marines, who got more than enough love in the original. This includes the newly introduced Imperial Guard -- it's their duty to die for The Imperium, and by The Emperor they will do so.  The campaigns are split into two catagories: Order, having Eldar and Imperial Guard gameplay, and Disorder, having Chaos and Da Orks as the playable factions. For both, it goes back and forth between the two races until the final two missions, where you've got to pick a side and stick with it (don't worry, you can skip straight there to replay it for the other ending once you're done). There are, shall we say, odd difficulty spikes throughout the campaigns, but they're all winable.  The game's also got important story tie-ins to the other games in the series: The events on Lorn V are referenced numorous times by characters in Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, and Taldeer and Gorgutz both make their first appearances here. Gortutz iz da important one ya gits."
93200,Revenge of the Titans,This game is the dopest fresh swag! 
9340,Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts,"Continues Company of Heroes, it's more of the same."
9350,Supreme Commander,"This is the best non fortress type game where you can take your time, build up massive forces, and conduct large organized attacks. Where as Forged Alliance might be better for those who like the faster games (maybe?). If you have A.D.D., and/or like more fantasy mage like laser shows and nuke grenade launchers mounted on tigers with lots of icing, then you might pass on this one.  However if you're like me and savour a prolonged process of building a base and army and using it to make deliberate attacks all while defending against manageable attacks, then this is the best for that, that i know of, to this day. I also felt the graphics are very good, and the units (i only played lately and remember the 'humans') are cool and realistic looking with scale being dramatic and impressive.   Having played the first C&amp;C when it came out to Starcraft 2 and everything in between, this is my personal favorite RTS for the reasons i described above and a bit more. There are better im sure, with more fancy options and glitter, but when it comes to about as long as you want drawn out defending and attacking on a massive scale, it's the best out there."
94000,Dinner Date,Dipped that bread. Dipped it good.
9420,Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance,A truly awesome game.
94200,Jamestown,"Best Shooter ever!  Thats what I said back in 2012. Unfortunately since the last update, this game has been broken beyond repair. Depending on which graphics card you have, the bullets are now either the wrong colour or grayscale, which makes it almost impossible to play properly.  It doesn't matter whether you play on Windows, OS X or Linux, the bug persists throughout all builds.   I would have given this game 10/10 before, now it's been abandoned by the devs though and isn't playable anymore."
94300,The Dream Machine,Too difficult. Unless you're super good at puzzle games it's nearly impossible D:
94400,Nidhogg,"The game is fun, but the price tag is way too steep.   The game does provide some pretty fun 1v1 moments with friends, but you wont be playing for a long time.  Wait for a sale, and make sure you have someone to play with."
9450,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm","A older RTS strategy game made in 2008. It is a sequel to Dark Crusade, In this game, there are two new races who are the Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle. They are nice additions to the game and adds more replayability in their campaigns. So far I've finished the Tau Empire campaign which was about 20 or so hours. *Just imagine how long it would be playing through every single race's campiagn* The game also features skirmish and mulitplayer modes for those who want to play with friends or other players.  *Edited* I have played some of the mulitplayer and it is pretty good and fun, especially when you and a friend can properly get the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod where it adds new units, buildings and over stuff. With that mod alone, this game/series of games would be a literal 10/10, as there are endless strategies and replayability it has. But since I'm reviewing the base game it wouldn't make it into the final score.   At the end of the day, I highly recommend buying and playing this game. I remember playing Dark Crusade many, many years ago and loved the heck out of it. This game basically has much more content and playability than Dark Crusade. On a scale of 1-10, it would be 9/10, very fun and can be addicting if you want to complete all of the race's campaigns. There are very few things that can go wrong with this game, and to be honest, The closest thing that i could nit pick on was the customization. I wish I could choose/customize every single unit in the game to my color scheme/preference."
94500,Back to the Future: Ep 2 - Get Tannen!,"This is a freaking AWESOME game! Did a playthrough of it on my YouTube channel, and loved every second of it. It's a great point and click adventure. If you loved the Back To The Future Movies, than you'll LOVE this game! They even have the voices from the actual movie in the game. I rate it 10/10!"
94510,Back to the Future: Ep 3 - Citizen Brown,5/5
94530,Back to the Future: Ep 5 - OUTATIME,Great game and story. BTTF fans will surely enjoy this.
94590,Puzzle Agent 2,"If you liked the first one, this is more of the same. Just don't expect the story to wrap up neatly. Would be great if they made another one eventually."
9460,Frontlines: Fuel of War,"Bought this game a couple of years ago while it was on a -75% sale. Good thing that I didn't pay more for it because the game is pretty lame. There are older games than this that look and play much better than this one.   Also, you have to empty your whole gun magazine on an enemy grunt before he bites the dust, while you are nearly dead after 3 shots or something.  There used to be a multiplayer function, but sadly I've never been able to play it because THQ decided to permanently shut down the multiplayer servers (lame). I repeat, there is NO MULTIPLAYER (only LAN). So don't buy this game. Even though you can't even buy it on Steam anymore, don't buy it elsewhere either. It's not worth it. Better just download it if you want to play the (very short) SP campaign. There's no support from THQ anymore so you shouldn't support them either by buying this game."
94600,Hector: Ep 1,This game makes me feel like I have returned to the Land of Blight(y).
94610,Hector: Ep 2,"Let me begin by saying that Hector, the titular hero of this game, is having a really bad day. After the painful events of Episode 1 (some of which are devastating to our hero's private life), he find himself unarmed and equipped with only one slice of pizza facing a deadly sniper rifle. Great. Any move he makes means absolutely certain death unless he can figure something out and if you know Hector, you know that this means YOU have to figure it out because he certainly can't.  Episode 2 picks up where Episode 1 left off as you accompany Hector and his reliable-ish sidekick, Lambert, in chasing down the terrorist that forced him to do his bidding in Ep.1. Along the way, he'll be screaming at turds (in more sense than one), mingle with local celebrities and do everything he can to cuff the insane criminal mastermind that continues to elude him.  There are some issues with this game: mostly, important items look exactly like the backgrounds of the game (which are quite ... nevermind). Also, some of the riddle solutions jump right at you, but the way to accomplish them doesn't and in one case I thought it was very contrived. The Hint-System is marginally more helpful than Lambert (you'll know what this means if you played part 1), but the riddles are, overall, not impossible(-y stupid). Still, if you enjoyed 'We Negotiate with Terrorist', you will enjoy this one, too. Hector is as crude and rude as we know and love him and the climax of 'Senseless Acts of Justice' does leave me wanting for more."
94620,Hector: Ep 3,"If you're British, you will love the slang and colloquialisms. If you're not British, you will come out of this experience learning a few :D It's a grerat game.  If you're looking for a silly, good humoured point and click with interesting characters and a little bit of brain teasing/problem solving, then this is the game for you. It's different to Telltale's other games such as Walking Dead, but in a good way. Think more in line with Monkey Island with easier brain teasing puzzles.  All in all, great game!"
9480,Saints Row 2,It's bad
9500,Gish,"EDIT: Apparently the game is totally busted, avoid at all costs until update!  A true classic.   From the designer of Super Meat Boy... this is where Edmund really built up his level design chops. Super secret hidden levels, brilliant platforming mechanics, and just overall charm.  Granted, if you can't get a grapple on the physical aspect of the movement you probably won't like this game.  Still though, fantastic platformer."
95300,Capsized,"I finished this game in about to hours. I couldn't get my Xbox controller ro work, so not sure how true partial support is. It's very much a phone port. The controls are horrid. Everything is much too loose and all the physics objects are finicky to interact with. It got very samey after the first couple of badly designed levels. I got this in a bundle so I guess I got my value out of it, but it is in no way worth 10 bucks on its own. Pass"
95400,ibb & obb,"I want to love this game. It's cute, the controlls are tight. The puzzles ARE good. I want to reccomend this game...  but I cant.  There's a big brick wall of problems here and there. While the puzzles are designed well there are more than a few instances of mechanics placed around the puzzle as if to throw you off of the answer (mechanical level was a big one for us). There is also a DISTINCT lack of button use. Sure the game is jump and that's it, but we had to restart a handful of levels simply because there's no die option. If you get stuck, too bad, restart the whole level. There is a series of levels in the dark where your visibility is limited. We quit here, and are unsure if we will return, the design felt cheap at this point, with synthetic difficulty."
95700,The Cat and the Coup,"It is a telling about the political leader of Iran, prior to what we see Iran as now, a terrorist promoting country. The leader at least according to sources from the game (and other sources that I went to look up myself) was improperly ousted by outside government forces and it could be one of the key reasons that we see Iran in the state it is now. Good for a brief history lesson, gameplay mechanics simple but proper for waht it is. I approve."
95900,Air Conflicts - Secret Wars,"Fantastic game, it's not perfect but still great. There's drawings, narration, solid storyline and very few frustrating moments.  The planes are nice, the graphics are alright and you can gain level ups to boost certain stats and you can unlock planes with stars you earn from objectives. It is a bit limited though, as the stats barely made any difference and you don't have a choice as to which plane you're unlocking but in the end it didn't matter, it was a fun, solid game. I think the worst part of the game are the timed missions but on the hardest difficulty, I only had to retry them half a dozen times before nailing it.  I even learned a thing or two from this game, apparently there was a few jet aircrafts during WW2. Also, the voice actors are absolutely incredible, loved every minute of it."
96100,Defy Gravity,"Really fun platforming game. Use gravity wells that pull things toward them or push them away to hop along enemies, move platforms around, try to avoid killer stars, and often accidentally fling yourself to your death. Somewhat short, but totally worth the price for how much fun it is."
96800,Nexuiz,14.5/20
96900,Slam Bolt Scrappers,Total clusterfukk of tetris and other 'combine the colors' puzzlers. It's no fun at all it has no right to exist.
97000,Solar 2,"It's ok, but I can't imagine myself saying to anyone, 'You should play Solar 2. I recommend it.'  At first, it was frustrating, then I kind of liked it, then I was done beating all the missions. It's worth buying for a dollar. There's not much to it. It.s a fairly short and simple game with a small number of missions."
9710,Desperados 2: Cooper’s Revenge,"Unfortunately I have to confirm that this game is unplayable and broken on AMD graphics cards. Certain objects are visible trough buildings, trees,... It looks completely broken and is unplayable.  People with nvidia cards might get a good game, but don't even bother getting or installing this game if you have an AMD card in your rig."
97110,Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns,"It's bad enough that the tutorials take several hours to run. But, the first scenario of the main game I found to be unbeatable. You have almost no time to amass a sizable force of any kind before wave after wave of enemy soldiers descend on your base and wipe you out. Just my experience. But, based on that, I wish I had never bought it."
97120,Kohan: Ahriman's Gift,"Simply, one of the best RTS games by even today's standards. Recently played on-line for over 4 hours with zero issues.  If you are a fan of 'thinking' RTS games where strategical decisions are as impotant as the tactical ones, then this game offers it all. The AI is superb &amp; can be tweaked to your liking via text files for an endless supply of all types of playing styles.  The multiple victory conditions, outstanding RMG, excellent UI, wonderfully stable game play, excellent end game stat screen, a video file to watch your/other's replays, modding is possible, etc, etc. This game was done right."
97130,Kohan II: Kings of War,"I would love to play it, but it crashes every hour. I save a lot, often, but there is no excuse to have games crash. I can't bother with this.  Shame, as the game seems fun. Maybe even a nice upgrade from the first Kohan, though not that big a leap up.  Uninstalled : ("
9730,Tycoon City: New York,"So I bought this game off another digital download service a few years ago and it worked perfectly.  Then I had my old computer die on me and had to buy a new one and reinstall everything. So I head back there to redownload the game, only to find out they switched their original digital download to a Steam key.  'Hey, no biggie', I thought. 'Might as well have it on Steam'.  Except no. My perfectly good copy of the game has been switched for this Steam-ing pile of crap, complete with missing models and textures. It's not like I can reinstall it from a CD either. There WAS a perfectly fine digital download for this game, for which I paid, but I can't play it anymore, because someone somewhere decided that this is what Steam users would get. That's as if someone took the jewel case of your favorite album, and swapped the CD inside for a Nickelback CD (unless you're a Nickelback fan, in which case I hope God has mercy on your soul).   Of course, the digital download service won't do a refund due to the purchase having been made years ago, and I can't really get one from Steam either because I just activated my key here, so I'm basically screwed...   My advice is DO NOT BUY, even if they discount it at 75 cents. This is a thoroughly broken product, and it's extremely unlikely that it will ever be updated."
9760,Act of War: High Treason,"The game itself is a pretty good RTS, essentially a C&amp;C clone. Nothing new, but good if you like that.  Sadly in the later Missions when Naval Units join the Fray,a lot of Bugs appear. Sound Loops and Access violation Crashes.  The Game files get corrupted and even redownloading just leads to new File corruption after restart.  All this on Windows 7. But the Forum says on win 10 its even worse.  Although its better than its prequel (from what i could play), i cannot recommend a game which can only be played for about 30%."
9800,Death to Spies,"This game is broken for me, but I still like it."
98100,TRAUMA,"As a project for university this 'game' would be okay. 0,50€ or 1€ would be okay for this cellphoneish game. Took about 30 minutes to finish the game. Maybe 2 hours if you wanna find all secrets. After I found out how the game works it gets boring and feels like just clicking through some images to the goal.  Maybe it's worth the money if you can identify with the story but it's not that deep or emotional."
98200,Frozen Synapse,"Despite the interesting concept behind planning your moves ahead taking in consideration the perks and limitations of each type of weapon, I quit playing when I got to the stage where the AI starts attacking you with the quick-reload rocket launcher.  It became obvious that, from that point on, the game would compensate AI dumbness with overpowered weapons. This is an interesting game up to that stage, though."
98300,Toy Soldiers,"This is a wonderful game, very challenging and requires strategy not luck and blunder."
98400,Hard Reset,"Running backward simulator - 5/10.  Tldr:  Exhausting and anti-fun gameplay, beating this game was painful  Gameplay: Enemies are so tough and your weapons are so weak you have to run backward and shot every single fight. Everything in this game can kill you in a few hits. Enemies are usually spawning out of nowhere, most times right in front of you and you have to run. Weapons in this game are either super weak, or weak and slow, or weak and hard to aim/hit. You have a clear view across large area but enemies can spawn anytime 1m in front of you giving no time to prepare in advance or snipe from long distance.  A/V: Nice graphics, repetitive music.  Story: Comic-style cutscenes are nice but the only clue about beating the game was a steam achievement. Totally story unrelated machine turned out to be a final boss. Weird AF."
9850,Codename: Panzers - Cold War,Cant get the damn thing to run.
98500,Naval Warfare,"It is very poorly optimized. The textures keep flipering, wich makes the game visualy unbearable. There are almost no graphics options and changing them don't help with the textures problem."
98600,"Demolition, Inc.","Nominated for the 'I'm Not Crying, There's Something in My Eye' award because this game is so horrible it makes me want to cry. After rotting in my library for a few years because of incompatible hardware once I was finally able to play the game it was so bland and boring I just gave up. I was expecting so much more and it just wasn't there. If I could've refunded this game at the time I would have."
9870,Ghostbusters: The Video Game,"This is, to me, considered Ghostbusters 3. It has all the original cast and the story ties the whole franchise perfectly. This game is totally worth playing if you're a ghostbusters fan."
9880,Champions Online,"Before Perfect World acquired this game, I paid around $300 to acquire Lifetime Gold Member upgrade.  After Perfect World acquired this game and begin banning people from certain region, I'm no longer be able to play the game I paid for. Please, Perfect World, die."
98900,Alien Hallway,"The game is a bit short and basic, but if you feel like you need some alien carnage where you can have one hand on a mouse and another inside a bag of chips (or crisps if you're a Brit), this game is ideal. And it's surprisingly fun actually.  There are two sides of the hallway and you need to spawn your soldiers on the left in clever enough way to push aliens back through the hallway to the right till you can annihilate them completely. Like many people said, it's a tug-of-war style game. You also have to balance resource gathering and spawning of soldiers so it requires a bit of thinking as well as usage of 'powerups' like grenades. And best part is the somewhat RPG-ish upgrading of your capabilities. You can buy new soldier/weapon types, upgrade weapons and 'powerups', speed up gathering of resources etc.  I think it's good value even at full price and if you get it with a deal, it's even better. Now I need to find more similar games because I want to experience more of this genre :)"
9900,Star Trek Online, WORST SUPPORT I EVER GET
99100,Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale,"This is by far one of the worst games ever made for public consumption. Find out all the names of the people involved in this atrocity and follow them around in life and see what else they are a part of so that you can avoid their next affronts to humanity. Daggerdale is an atrocious, low-quality nightmare.  If you were hoping for either (1) a true Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience or (2) a true role-playing game experience, then know that you will get neither from Daggerdale. It is totally lame, and you will wonder why the heck you did this to yourself. Stay away from this game at all costs. Try Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online (DDO), which is free-to-play and gives you a far better RPG and D&amp;D experience."
99120,Yar's Revenge,"I really wish there were more games out there that played like the old panzer dragoon games. I enjoy playing this game, I use a xbox 360 controller and have had no issues at all. Its a fun game would recommend"
99300,Renegade Ops,"A deliciously gratifying, perfectly executed symphony of destruction, drifting and comic humor with reveling sound effects, unreal visuals and incredible voice acting.  This is the kind of game that I would call an instant classic and a timeless legend.  "
9940,Blade Kitten,After ALL i think i will not RECOMMANDED THIS (really have mixed feeling)  Okay plaformer with a catgirl the cut scene are good and funny but a litle silly. the action is decent and fun. the metascore is really underrated it not awesome but 52 really too low worth a 60.  65 if you like catgirl and that cute ... squirrel or whatever??? Skiffy. riding that chocobo thing is fun  bad point  can very repetive not much variety (collect and fight are often same) so cut scene are silly or boring or both but look good. not much skill to use fighting repetive. Only need rest a little and get full health.  Don't expect much but it fun but only 6/10 or less. (cute but repetive) recommanded only if you like catgirl a lot. and if on sale.
99400,Garshasp: The Monster Slayer,"The first time I wrote a review of this game I didn't recommend it. In fact, it was the worst review I ever gave to a game.  The reason was simple, the game didn't work with recent updates of Nvidia Physx, and since other games required the most recent version of Physx the game didn't allow us to have other games installed. So, for more than two years I wasn't able to play the game.  Probabily Nvidia, or Steam, or even Windows, solved the problem because the developers didn't release any updates since 2011, even with all the complaints they have received. I'm still waiting for an answer from them.  The truth is, recently I decided to give the game a second chance and see if the problems were fixed and it's kind of a miracle, but the game works.  So, about it, it's clearly a ripoff of God of War. But it has its own charm and qualities, so if you liked God of War and are looking for an alternative to the PC, you can enjoy this game. The story is simple but good enough and the gameplay and graphics are also good enough.  The real great problem of the game is the camera, I almost lost to the first boss because of it, and in many times it's responsible for a bad jump followed from a fall into the abyss or getting hit because you stop seeing your character and the enemy, wich can be frustrating at times.  So, if you can leave with a bad camera and the total lack of support from the developers and you want a game similar to God of War on the PC, this is a good enough alternative.  This time, I give it a thumbs up because I could find good things in the game and potential and have already bought it, but the total lack of support from the developers almost makes me give it a thumbs down. You shouldn't sell games if you don't give them support. So, it's up to you if you want to ignore it and give money to some guys who don't care about you and simply enjoy the game they made or not."
99410,Garshasp: Temple of the Dragon,"- Decent controls with combos - Simple puzzles - Bad camera angles (you have no control over camera) - Boring story and voice acting - Very, very short (took me 100 minutes to complete) - Still somewhat fun to play   Overall I can't recommend buying it. It simply doesn't offer enough to be a good game."
9960,Haunted House,"To put things briefly: DON'T BUY IT. DON'T BUY IT. DON'T BUY IT. DON'T BUY IT. DON'T BUY IT. DON'T BUY IT. DON'T BUY IT. DON'T BUY IT. Now to the actual review. This game is not worth you time or money. It is a barebones experience without a ghost of a chance to be entertaining. And yes, this game is worse than those puns I just made. I came into this game wanting to enjoy it, and I came out sorely disappointed less than an hour later. It is a boring, samey slog through tiring, repetitive levels. The gameplay is so minimal that it utterly fails to entertain. A clear lack of effort is evident in the subpar level design, outdated graphics, and poor gameplay. I am glad I got this for dirt cheap through a sale, because payng any mre than 2 US dollars for this would be highway robbery. When Valve finally gets around to implementing that refund policy, this is the first game I'm going to make use of it with. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED AND BORED."
9970,Star Raiders ,"Terrible controls, boring story, and uninspiring combat.   Nothing else needs to be said."
99700,NightSky,"Getting your marble from one place to another is the basic premise of this game. The story told in the beginning doesn't really hold much of anything but the game physics do shine along with its changing mechanics such as adding or removing gravity control, boost and etc.  My only complaint is that the transition between the segments should be more fluid because I don't enjoy going to the edge of the screen only to find myself somewhere in the middle in the next one. It feels strange to 'teleport'. It breaks the immersion of moving forward. Then again, the story did say that we are in a dream.  If you like playing with marbles then this is definitely worth adding to your collection.  For me, I'm just annoyed with playing it."
9980,The UnderGarden,This game is cute overload and a great way to unwind. The vibrant colors and fun music force happiness into every head based orifice.
99810,Bulletstorm,This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Don't buy it.
99830,Crysis 2,"Waste of 60 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars. The multiplayer servers blow ♥♥♥, and couldn't even hold up a singular user connected by fiber optics who is located 10 feet away."
9990,Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,"OMG. This is a bad game. It needs online MP and interaction with npc's, rooms that you can enter, more of everything, some nice voiceacting? It feels like a halfbaked game, maybe a huge re-coding of this game could save it, maybe.. Only good thing is that i didn't pay full price."
99900,Spiral Knights,I haven't played that much but it was fun
99910,Puzzle Pirates,"The puzzles in this game are fun, but you have to pay to do basically anything, and then everything expires. Buying something for a game that you are only going to play for a few hours maybe once or twice a week,but it is going to expire in two weeks...very stupid. Experence also expires. I really wish they would just get rid of everything that expires and then only made me pay for stuff once...until then not worth the money. All puzzles can be played for free across the internet. All things that make this game unique and interesting, require money."
